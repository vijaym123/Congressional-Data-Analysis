  <summary>4/23/2008--Introduced.
Recognizes the tenth anniversary of the signing of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (IRFA) and the fundamental importance of religious freedom within U.S. historical experience and foreign policy. Urges all United Nations member states to respect their obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Calls on the President to appoint a National Security Advisor on International Religious Freedom, promote respect for religious freedom, and address the findings and recommendations of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom regarding asylum-seekers in the United States. Calls on the Secretary of State to: (1) ensure that no foreign government official who has been directly involved in particularly severe violations of religious freedom receives a U.S. visa; (2) ensure that religious freedom is a key part of dialogue with all countries where concerns exist; (3) ensure that U.S. foreign aid program funding promotes respect for religious freedom; (4) ensure that religious freedom and other human rights training is required of all foreign service officers; and (5) develop strategies to address new religious freedom concerns.</summary>
