  <summary>7/13/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the United States should work with Mexico through the International Boundary and Water Commission to resolve the border fence dispute before assuming sole financial responsibility for removing the fence; and (2) if the Mexican government does not respect the Commission's authority to resolve border problems the U.S. government should reduce its foreign assistance to Mexico by the amount spent to remove and reconstruct the fence on U.S. territory.</summary>
