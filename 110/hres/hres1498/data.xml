  <summary>9/24/2008--Introduced.
Honors the visionary and extraordinary work of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) for: (1) pushing the barriers of science and providing the United States with historic high-performance computing capabilities that will allow some of the most challenging problems in science and engineering to be solved, such as the safety of the nuclear deterrent of the United States, the humane genome, and climate change; and (2) achieving the capability to make petaflop calculations (1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per second) using the Roadrunner supercomputer which is considered a crucial milestone internationally and a sign of U.S. competitiveness in the critical new area of high-performance computing.</summary>
