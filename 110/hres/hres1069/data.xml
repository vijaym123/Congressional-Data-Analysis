  <summary>9/9/2008--Passed House amended.
Condemns: (1) the broadcast of incitement to violence and hatred against Americans, Israelis, and the West by Middle East-based media; and (2) Hamas' use of children's television programming to incite hatred, violence, and anti-Semitism. Calls on: (1) Saudi Arabia and on all other Arab states that own shares in Arabsat to cease the transmission of telecasts by al-Aqsa TV and al-Manar TV; (2) Egypt to cease the transmission of telecasts by al-Rafidayn TV and al-Manar TV; and (3) the owners of Eutelsat and the government of France to cease the transmission of telecasts by al-Aqsa TV. Demands that Hamas recognize Israel's right to exist and renounce the use of violence. Calls on the President to: (1) designate al-Aqsa TV a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity; and (2) consider state sponsorship of anti-American incitement when determining relations with regional states. Urges governments and private investors who own shares in satellite companies or otherwise influence decisions about satellite transmissions to oppose transmissions of telecasts by al-Aqsa TV, al-Manar TV, al-Rafidayn TV, or any other terrorist-owned and -operated stations that purvey anti-American, anti-Western, anti-Israeli, and anti-Semitic messages and openly incite their audiences to commit acts of terrorism.</summary>
