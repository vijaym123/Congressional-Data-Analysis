  <summary>7/22/2008--Introduced.
Declares that an independent redistricting commission is the best vehicle for ensuring that congressional redistricting conducted by a state is done in a manner that respects the principles of transparency, effective and diverse public participation, and accountability, so long as the redistricting is conducted in accordance with a plan developed by such a commission using criteria and procedures that will discourage gerrymandering and promote competition, and to the extent that such criteria and procedures are consistent with the applicable requirements of the Constitution of the United States and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Declares that a state should not be redistricted until after the next apportionment of Representatives, unless a court requires it to conduct such subsequent redistricting to comply with the Constitution or to enforce such Act.</summary>
