Urges the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to: (1) continue to enhance security against terrorist attack and other security threats to our nation's rail and mass transit lines, as well as school transportation systems, including as provided for in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007; (2) continue development of the National Explosives Detection Canine Team program, with particular attention to the application of its training standards and the establishment of a reliable source of domestically-bred canines; and (3) improve upon the success of the Online Learning Center by providing increased person-to-person professional development programs for persons responsible for securing against such attacks on our transportation systems. Urges TSA to give special attention to school transportation systems by working with school administrators, state and local law enforcement, and other representatives in the school transportation industry to keep children safe from terrorist attack.</summary>
