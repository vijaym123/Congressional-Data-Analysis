  <summary>7/11/2007--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should: (1) make clear to the governments of major natural gas exporting countries that it regards efforts to establish a cartel or other mechanism to manipulate the supply of natural gas to the world market for the purpose of setting an arbitrary and nonmarket price, or as an instrument of political pressure, to be prejudicial to the security of the United States and of the world as a whole; (2) develop a joint strategy with its allies and all countries that are importers of natural gas, as well as with cooperative exporting countries, to prevent the establishment of such a cartel or other similar mechanism, including by diversifying sources and alternative means of access by exporters and importers to international markets, such as by pipeline; and (3) work with its allies to reduce our dependence on natural gas and to increase and promote the utilization of clean energy sources.</summary>
