  <summary>6/26/2008--Introduced.
Condemns the broadcast of incitement to violence against Americans and the United States by Middle East-based media. Calls on the President to: (1) designate al-Aqsa TV as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT); (2) designate as SDGTs satellite providers that knowingly contract with SDGTs to broadcast their channels for support to terrorist entities; and (3) consider state sponsorship of anti-American incitement when determining relations with, and assistance to, regional states.</summary>
