  <summary>4/24/2008--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the International Joint Commission's proposed Plan 2007 does not provide the necessary level of environmental protections and benefits for Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River; (2) the views of the public and the state that has jurisdiction of waters to be regulated must be fully considered when a new plan for the management of water levels is selected; (3) any water level management plan should make every effort to maximize hydropower production at existing facilities; and (4) the Secretary of State should not approve a plan that fails to meet such criteria.</summary>
