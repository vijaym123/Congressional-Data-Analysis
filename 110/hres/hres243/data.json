Condemns the violations of the freedoms of speech, religion, movement, association, and the lack of due process in Vietnam. Challenges Vietnam's qualifications to be a member of the U.N. Security Council unless the government of Vietnam begins to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Urges the government of Vietnam to consider the implications of its actions for the broader U.S.-Vietnam relationship. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should: (1) make a top concern the immediate release, legal status, and humanitarian needs of Father Nguyen Van Ly, Nguyen Van Dai, Le Quoc Quan, and Le Thi Cong Nhan, and use funds from the Human Rights Defenders Fund to assist with their legal defense and the needs of their families; (2) urge the government of Vietnam to comply with international standards for basic freedoms and human rights; (3) make clear to the government of Vietnam that it must adhere to the rule of law and respect the freedom of religion and expression in order to broaden its relations with the United States; (4) consider re-imposing on Vietnam the country of particular concern designation; and (5) initiate new foreign assistance programs to advance the capacity and networking abilities of Vietnamese civil society."
