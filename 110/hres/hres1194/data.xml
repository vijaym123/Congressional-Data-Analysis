  <summary>5/22/2008--Passed House without amendment.
Reaffirms support for the legitimate, democratically-elected government of Lebanon under Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. Expresses sympathy to the people of Lebanon who have again been thrust against their will into a Hizballah-initiated conflict. Condemns: (1) Hizballah's illegitimate assault on Lebanon's sovereign government; and (2) Syria and Iran for providing military support to Hizballah in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions. Urges: (1) the U.S. government and the international community to support Lebanon's government; (2) the Security Council to condemn Syria and Iran; (3) countries controlling transit routes from Iran to Lebanon to impose controls on the movement of Iranian vehicles, airplanes, and goods to ensure that Iran is not illegally transferring arms to Hizballah and other terrorist groups; and (4) the European Union (EU) to designate Hizballah as a terrorist group.</summary>
