Urges: (1) the U.S. government and the international community to support Lebanon's government; (2) the Security Council to condemn Syria and Iran; (3) countries controlling transit routes from Iran to Lebanon to impose controls on the movement of Iranian vehicles, airplanes, and goods to ensure that Iran is not illegally transferring arms to Hizballah and other terrorist groups; and (4) the European Union (EU) to designate Hizballah as a terrorist group."
