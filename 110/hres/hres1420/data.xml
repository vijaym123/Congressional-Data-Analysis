Recognizes September 11 as a day of solemn commemoration. Extends deepest condolences to friends, families, and loved ones of the innocent victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Honors the heroic service, actions, and sacrifices of first responders, law enforcement personnel, state and local officials, volunteers and others who aided the victims and, in doing so, risked and often sacrificed their own lives. Expresses gratitude to foreign leaders and citizens who have assisted and continue to assist the United States against terrorism. Asserts that the war on terrorism is not a war on any nation, people, or faith. Recognizes the heroic service, actions, and sacrifices of U.S. Armed Forces and civilian personnel in the defense against terrorists and their supporters. Vows to continue to identify, intercept, and defeat terrorists. Reaffirms that the American people will never forget the sacrifices made on and since September 11, 2001, and will defeat those who attacked the United States through our shared determination, spirit, and embrace of democratic values.</summary>
