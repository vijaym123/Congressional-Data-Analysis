  <summary>9/27/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of House of Representatives that: (1) the United States should support a political settlement in Iraq based on the final provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of government and allow for the creation of federal regions, consistent with the wishes of the Iraqi people and their elected leaders; (2) the United States should urge the government of Iraq to quickly agree upon and implement a law providing for the equitable distribution of oil revenues, which is a critical component of a comprehensive political settlement based upon federalism; and (3) nothing in this resolution should be construed in any way to infringe on the sovereign rights of the nation of Iraq.</summary>
