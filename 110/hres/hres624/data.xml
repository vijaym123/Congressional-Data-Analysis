  <summary>10/15/2007--Passed House amended.
Congratulates the government and people of Israel on Israel's first appointment to chair a U.N. committee. Supports continued expansion of Israel's role at the United Nations. Welcomes recent attempts by the United Nations to address anti-Semitism. Calls on the United Nations to officially and publicly condemn anti-Semitic statements made at all U.N. meetings and hold accountable member states that make such statements. Urges the members of the Western Europe and Others Group to extend full and permanent membership to Israel until such time as Israel can serve as an effective member of the Asian States Group. Calls upon U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon to continue to work to end any unfair vilification of Israel at the United Nations and ensure Israel's full participation in, and access to, all international fora under U.N. auspices.</summary>
