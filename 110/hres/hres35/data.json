Specifies the composition of the Select Panel, including three members of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Requires each Panel member to be treated, for Panel purposes, as though a member of the Committee on Appropriations. Applies Rule XI (Procedures of Committees and Unfinished Business) to the Select Panel in the same manner as a subcommittee, except that the Select Panel cannot require, by subpoena or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of books, records, correspondence, memoranda, papers, and documents. Authorizes a subpoena of the Committee on Appropriations or its Defense Subcommittee to specify terms of return to the Select Panel."
