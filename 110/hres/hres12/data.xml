  <summary>1/4/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States: (1) must move rapidly to increase the productivity with which it uses fossil fuel, and to accelerate the transition to renewable fuels and a sustainable, clean energy economy; and (2) should establish, in collaboration with other international allies, an energy project with the magnitude, creativity, and sense of urgency of the "Man on the Moon" project to develop a comprehensive plan to address the challenges presented by Peak Oil (the peak in the world's oil production believed by some petroleum experts likely to occur in the next decade).</summary>
