Bush should not grant preemptive pardons to senior officials of his Administration for acts they may have taken in the course of their official duties; (2) a special investigative commission or Select Committee should be tasked with investigating possible illegal activities by such senior Administration officials, including any abuse of the President's pardon power; and (3) the next Attorney General should appoint an independent counsel to investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute illegal acts by senior Administration officials.</summary>
