  <summary>5/22/2008--Introduced.
Calls for the following principles for a market-based approach to be included in any health care bill considered by the 110th Congress: (1) the ability to receive point-of-service health care in preventative, emergency, and rehabilitative settings in rural and urban areas; (2) refundable tax credits for the purchase of health insurance by low-income recipients, combined with laws that permit association and small business health plans; (3) medical liability reform; (4) safe and effective health service with measurable results through health information technology; (5) building new incentives into health plans to encourage wellness and prevention and to provide incentives for people to make smart choices involving their health, health care, and health insurance coverage; and (6) giving consumers the ability to choose the best health care plan and options to meet their needs through portable health insurance and Health Savings Accounts.</summary>
