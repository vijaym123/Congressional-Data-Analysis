  <summary>1/16/2008--Introduced.
Recognizes: (1) the relationship between free trade agreements and the increase of imports; (2) that adoption of additional trade agreements will likely significantly increase the number of products and food our nation imports; (3) that current U.S. trade policies must be improved to adequately ensure the safety of imported food and products; (4) the link between current U.S. trade policies and the increase in tainted imported food and unsafe products; (5) that the percentage of food imports currently inspected by the United States is inadequate and poses a risk to American families; and (6) the need to ensure the safety of imported food before additional trade agreements are ratified.Encourages: (1) federal agencies charged with keeping imported food safe to step up inspections; and (2) greater vigilance by federal agencies in ensuring imported products and food are safe.</summary>
