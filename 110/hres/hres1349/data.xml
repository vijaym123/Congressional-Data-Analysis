  <summary>7/15/2008--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the government of the Czech Republic is to be commended for formally agreeing to station on its territory a U.S. radar system to track ballistic missiles that would threaten the collective security of the United States, the Czech Republic, and their North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies; and (2) this agreement will deepen the bilateral strategic relationship between the United States and the Czech Republic and could make a substantial contribution to NATO's capability to counter ballistic missile threats.</summary>
