  <summary>6/18/2007--Introduced.
Makes it out of order, during the remainder of the 110th Congress, to consider a conference report to accompany a regular general appropriation bill unless the joint explanatory statement prepared by the managers on the part of the House and the Senate, respectively, includes a list of congressional earmarks in the conference report or joint statement (and the name of the requesting Member of Congress) that were not committed to the conference committee by either chamber, not in a report on such bill, and not in a report of a committee of the Senate on a companion measure. Makes it out of order to consider a rule or order that waives the application of this resolution.</summary>
