  <summary>9/23/2008--Introduced.
Expresses outrage over the expulsions of the U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela and the U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia. Condemns the failure of the governments of Venezuela and Bolivia to adhere to their obligations under international counter-narcotics agreements. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) it should continue to be U.S. policy to work with all Andean countries to combat trafficking in narcotics and other controlled substances; and (2) steps should be taken to restore full cooperation between Venezuela, Bolivia, and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).</summary>
