  <summary>3/11/2008--Passed House amended.
Expresses the appreciation of the House of Representatives to all countries that worked to ratify the amendments to the Bonn Accords to allow for open access to the Holocaust Archives located in Bad Arolsen, Germany. Congratulates the efforts of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Department of State, and the International Committee of the Red Cross to open the archives. Encourages the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the International Committee of the Red Cross to act with urgency to ensure that survivors, their families, and researchers have access to, and assistance in using, the archives. Remembers the murder of six million innocent Jews and of more than five million other innocent victims committed by the Nazis and their collaborators. States that the House of Representatives must remain vigilant in combating global anti-Semitism, intolerance, and bigotry.</summary>
