  <summary>5/19/2008--Passed House amended.
Recognizes: (1) National Missing Children's Day and encourages all Americans to plan events to raise public awareness about the issue of missing children; and (2) that one of the most important tools for law enforcement to use in the case of a missing child is an up-to-date, good quality photograph and urges all parents and guardians to follow this precaution. Acknowledges that National Missing Children's Day should remind Americans not to forget the children who are still missing and not to waver in the effort to reunite them with their families.</summary>
