Calls on the President and the Secretary of State to lead a diplomatic effort to ensure that the Durban Review Conference focuses on the implementation of state commitments to combat racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, and to defeat any effort by states to use the forum to promote anti-Semitism or hatred against members of any group or to call into question the legitimacy of any state. Commends all governments that have declared their intentions not to participate in any United Nations Durban Review Conference that sidesteps such commitments and promotes hate, undermines human rights standards, and damages U.N. credibility. Urges all member states not to support such a Conference. Commends civil society organizations that have joined together to learn from the shortcomings of the 2001 World Conference Against Racism and to work toward a 2009 Durban Review Conference that rejects hatred. Recognizes the attempts of some countries to prevent a focus on ongoing racism by utilizing inflammatory language, employing divisive tactics and strategies, fostering an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and otherwise deviating from the commitments made at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in order to divert the 2009 Durban Review Conference from the important goal of eradicating global racism. Calls on U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to urge the Human Rights Council to adhere to its mandate and asks him to refocus the 2009 Durban Review Conference efforts on the review of what U.N. member states have done to fulfill their commitments to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and on concrete action to fight racism, anti-Semitism, and all forms of hatred and violence. Calls on the High Commissioner for Human Rights to urge U.N. member states to adhere to the agreed framework of the 2009 Durban Review Conference."
