  <summary>9/16/2008--Introduced.
Declares the sense of the House of Representatives that the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, when drafting a regulation and reviewing a project application related to natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale formation (New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland), should give the same consideration to the energy needs of the United States and the potential jobs that could be created by a proposed project as is accorded to other factors, such as: (1) quantity and rate of water usage; (2) location of water (ground and surface sources) for withdrawals and consumptive uses; (3) the potential to alter the physical, biological, chemical, or hydrological characteristics of the basin's water resources; and (4) the potential to affect interstate water quality.</summary>
