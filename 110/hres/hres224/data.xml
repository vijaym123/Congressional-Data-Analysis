  <summary>3/7/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that terrorists view the Internet as a key tool in their ongoing jihad and that, in a time of war, terrorist videos amount to enemy communications. States that Congress should not regulate the Internet, but website owners should remove enemy propaganda from their sites and cooperate with law enforcement and the intelligence community to report questionable postings. Recognizes and applauds the work of the SITE (Search for International Terrorist Entities) Institute, the Society for Internet Research, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) and others for their work in combating online jihad and creating a resource for public education.</summary>
