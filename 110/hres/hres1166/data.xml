  <summary>5/7/2008--Passed House without amendment.
Condemns recent decisions by the government of the Russian Federation to establish official ties with the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, a process that impedes reconciliation between those regions and the government of the Republic of Georgia and that violates Georgia's sovereignty and Russia's commitments to international peacekeeping. Calls upon the government of the Russian Federation to revoke its decision to establish official ties with the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Encourages Russia to work with Georgia, the peoples of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the international community to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. Calls on U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to investigate the April 2008 downing of an unarmed Georgian reconnaissance aircraft. Supports the declaration of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Bucharest Summit stating that Georgia will become a NATO member.</summary>
