  <summary>6/28/2007--Introduced.
Urges the United States to: (1) honor U.S. commitments made in the 2001 World Trade Organization Doha Declaration on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and Public Health, which allows World Trade Organization (WTO) members to fully use the flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement to protect public health and promote access to medicines for all; (2) not place countries on the "Special 301" Priority Watch List for exercising such flexibilites, such as issuing compulsory licenses to obtain generic medicines; (3) not ask developing countries that are trading partners to adopt measures to protect public health intellectual property rights in excess of protections required in the TRIPS Agreement; and (4) support new global norms for promoting medical research and development.</summary>
