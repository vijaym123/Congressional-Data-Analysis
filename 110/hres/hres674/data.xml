  <summary>9/24/2007--Introduced.
Expresses support for Israel's right to self defense in the face of an imminent nuclear or military threat from Syria. Pledges to continue to work with Prime Minister Olmert to ensure that Israel continues to receive critical military and economic assistance needed to address the growing security threat of Syria and Iran. Condemns: (1) the government of Syria for its continued support of terrorism and its illicit chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons activities, including close cooperation with North Korea; (2) the government of North Korea for providing Syria with technology, expertise, and materials to develop nuclear weapons; and (3) Syria and Iran for continuing to provide support to Hezbollah and Palestinian terrorist groups. Urges President Bush to: (1) condemn the government of North Korea for providing Syria with nuclear technology and expertise and to reexamine diplomatic discussions with North Korean in light of such activities; and (2) support strengthening U.S. sanctions against Syria.</summary>
