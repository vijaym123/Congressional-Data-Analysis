    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "2007-10-09", 
    "text": "Denounces and demands the cessation of the practices of female genital mutilation, domestic violence, honor killings, acid burning, dowry deaths, and other gender-based persecutions and crimes. Asserts that women are not chattel, should not be trafficked, exploited, or sold for services, and should not be denied the right to education, to ownership of property, or to participate in full, economic, social and political life. Demands the cessation of these barbaric practices and the dismantling of social and institutional mechanisms which perpetuate systematic discrimination against women and girls.Calls on all governments to pass enforceable laws banning these practices, prosecute any individuals who persecute or violate women and girls with these acts, and pass measures to empower women and girls and afford them equal access to educational, social, and economic opportunities.Calls on the President and fellow donor countries to promote the rights, health, empowerment of women in every aspect of their foreign assistance to developing countries, and discourage continued acts of violence against women and the impunity that often accompanies these acts. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) participation, protection, recognition, health, and equality of women and girls are crucial to achieving a just, moral, and peaceful society; and (2) regardless of religion, geography, or form of government, women should not be denied equal rights, which should be defended and enforced when they are abridged, challenged, or violated."
