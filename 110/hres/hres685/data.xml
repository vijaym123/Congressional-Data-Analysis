  <summary>9/27/2007--Introduced.
Supports: (1) the basic right of every employer in the United States to verify a potential employee's legal status; and (2) the bipartisan Basic Pilot Program as an effective tool giving employers the ability to verify potential employees' legal status. Calls on: (1) the Illinois legislature to repeal Illinois Public Act 095-0138, which violates federal law by denying employers the right to verify potential employees' legal status; and (2) the Governor of Illinois to file an amicus brief in the case of United States v. Illinois supporting the plaintiff's conclusion that Illinois Public Act 095-0138 violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.</summary>
