Petraeus, General Raymond Odierno, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker for the distinguished wartime leadership that made such success possible. Recognizes the success of the troop surge in Iraq and its strategic significance in advancing U.S. vital national interests in Iraq, the Middle East, and the world, in particular as a strategic victory in a central front of the war on terrorism. Recognizes that the gains achieved as a result of the troop surge are significant but not permanent, and that it is imperative that no action be taken that jeopardizes those gains or dishonors the service and sacrifice of the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces who made those gains possible."
