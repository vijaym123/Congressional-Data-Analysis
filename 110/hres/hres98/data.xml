  <summary>3/6/2007--Passed House amended.
Honors the life and achievements of Dr. John Garang de Mabior. Reaffirms the House of Representatives' commitment to a lasting peace in the Republic of the Sudan, and calls for full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Urges: (1) the people of Southern Sudan and its leaders to continue to support Dr. Garang's vision for a new Sudan; and (2) the full commitment of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union, the African Union, and the League of Arab States to support Dr. Garang's vision for a new Sudan by endorsing democratic elections throughout Sudan in 2009. Supports the creation of a Dr. John Garang de Mabior Institute for Agriculture, Peace, and Economic Development. Directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the Secretary of State with a request that the Secretary transmit it to Dr. Garang's widow, Rebecca Garang, and to the government of Southern Sudan, through the Office of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) in the District of Columbia.</summary>
