Declares that, during consideration of legislation between the two chambers making or continuing appropriations to the end of a fiscal year that includes appropriations for such Department for that fiscal year, it shall not be in order to consider such measure unless: (1) it includes a provision to bar such pay adjustment; or (2) the rule providing for its consideration allows a vote proposing such bar."
