  <summary>9/23/2008--Passed House amended.
Praises the efforts by those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that have enacted legislation for the restitution of, or compensation for, private and communal religious property confiscated during the Nazi and Communist eras. Urges the countries in Central and Eastern Europe that have not already done so to return confiscated properties to their rightful owners or, where restitution is not possible, pay equitable compensation. Calls on: (1) the governments of Poland and of Lithuania to enact legislation so that persons (or their heirs) whose property, or communities whose communal or religious property was confiscated during the Nazi or Communist eras are able to obtain restitution of, or compensation for, such property; (2) the President and the Secretary of State to continue to engage in dialogue with the governments of Poland and Lithuania supporting such legislation's adoption; and (3) the Secretary to report to Congress every six months regarding implementation of this resolution.</summary>
