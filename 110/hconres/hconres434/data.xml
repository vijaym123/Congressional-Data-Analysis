  <summary>9/26/2008--Introduced.
Strongly condemns the religious violence in India, including killings, rapes, and home and church destruction. Calls on India to: (1) restrict radical religious party elements that cause such violence, including the direct incitement to violence against Christians; and (2) prevent ongoing and future violence, including through adequate police protection and active prosecution. Calls on all Indian elected bodies to protect all citizens regardless of their religious beliefs. Condemns any laws restricting freedom of religion or the freedom to change one's religion. Urges the people of India to respect all peaceful religious beliefs and live together as a model to the rest of the world.</summary>
