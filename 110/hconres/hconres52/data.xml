  <summary>2/28/2007--Passed House without amendment.
Expresses support for the goals and ideals of American Heart Month. Reaffirms our nation's commitment to fighting heart disease by promoting awareness about its causes, risks, and prevention and by promoting new education programs, supporting research, and expanding access to medical treatment. Encourages every American to exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight, develop good eating habits, avoid tobacco, drugs, and excessive alcohol, and have regular checkups to take advantage of screenings that can detect heart-disease related problems early.</summary>
