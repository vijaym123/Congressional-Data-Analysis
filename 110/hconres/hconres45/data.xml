  <summary>1/24/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the House of Representatives supports the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group that: (1) the repositioning of U.S. troops to reflect strategic and tactical needs as determined by U.S. commanders in Iraq meet the objectives of training and equipping the Iraqi military, containing terrorism through special operations and rapid reaction forces, and ensuring the transfer of responsibility from United States to Iraqi control; (2) the United States establish an explicit framework for cooperation and coordination with Iraqi leaders that includes the achievement of specific milestones and objectives within a reasonable time frame; (3) the U.S. government launch a new diplomatic initiative to unite the region and build international consensus for stability and reconstruction in Iraq; and (4) any policies enacted by the Administration with regard to Iraq are implemented in direct and continued consultation with Congress and relevant House and Senate committees.</summary>
