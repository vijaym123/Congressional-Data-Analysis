Declares that the United States, through the International Whaling Commission, should: (1) use all appropriate measures to end commercial whaling, including scientific, special permit, coastal, and community-based whaling; (2) oppose any initiative that would result in any new, Commission-sanctioned coastal or community-based whaling, even if it is portrayed as noncommercial, including commercial whaling by coastal communities that does not qualify as aboriginal subsistence whaling; and (3) seek to strengthen conservation and management measures.</summary>
