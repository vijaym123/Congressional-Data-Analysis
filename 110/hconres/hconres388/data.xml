  <summary>9/17/2008--Passed House amended.
Declares the sense of Congress that: (1) the Secretary of Defense and the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) should inform members of the Armed Forces and their eligible dependents, with monthly electronic reminders, about opportunities to register to vote and to request absentee ballots for the 2008 elections; (2) state and local election officials should work with the FVAP to develop methods for obtaining updated addresses and contact information, if possible, for any such individuals, and any citizens living overseas, with undeliverable ballot addresses; and (3) the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness should report to specified congressional committees on all related efforts. Expresses the sense of Congress about related duties of states and local jurisdictions. Urges the Department of Defense, the FVAP, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and state governments to examine recommendations in the EAC September 2007 survey findings regarding the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act.</summary>
