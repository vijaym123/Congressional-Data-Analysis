  <summary>10/1/2007--Introduced.
Recognizes the service of all members of the Armed Forces serving in good standing and with honor to defend the United States, and the personal sacrifices made by them and their families. Commits to judge the merits of opinions of such members regarding the policies of the United States, including those related to military actions in Iraq, without prejudice or personal bias, including refraining from unwarranted personal attacks. Condemns the personal attacks made by broadcaster Rush Limbaugh impugning the integrity and professionalism of members who have expressed opinions regarding military actions in Iraq. Honors all members and civilian personnel serving in harm's way, as well as their families. Pledges to debate any supplemental funding request or any policy decisions regarding the war in Iraq with the solemn respect and commitment to integrity that the sacrifices of these members and civilian personnel deserve.</summary>
