    "text": "Expresses the sense of Congress that legislation should be enacted that protects buyers who have been victims of unscrupulous mortgage brokers and lenders. Urges that such legislation: (1) include an anti-predatory lending provision that bans unfair and deceptive practices; (2) require lenders to evaluate a borrower's ability to pay over the life of the loan (at the fully indexed rate for the fully amortized amount); (3) establish federal regulations regarding licensing, education, and experience requirements for mortgage brokers and loan officers in non-bank companies; (4) require that disclosures be written in plain language and prominently displayed in a manner that is visually clear and effectively communicates the intended information to the potential borrower; (5) reduce or eliminate prepayment penalties; (6) notify potential home buyers of lenders or brokers with high foreclosure rates; and (7) mandate pre-loan counseling."
