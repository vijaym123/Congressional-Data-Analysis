  <summary>7/31/2008--Introduced.
Calls for Congress to ensure that any reengineering of the U.S. health care system: (1) incorporates sustainable wellness programs that address the underlying causal factors of chronic disease; (2) ensures public access to strategies for improving individual health through lifestyle change; (3) provides patient-centered care that addresses personal health needs and that encourages patients to improve wellness through lifestyle changes and scientifically-based therapies that facilitate the body's inherent ability to maintain and restore optimal health; and (4) utilizes defined standards to determine when wellness and health promotion activities will be useful based on the patient's diet, exercise habits, and individual and family health histories.</summary>
