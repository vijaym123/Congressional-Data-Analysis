  <summary>5/23/2007--Introduced.
States that: (1) Congress finds that the relationship between the United States and the indigenous peoples of the United States, the United States Tribal Nations, grounded in the Constitution and implemented through Indian treaties, federal statutes, and policies, may be considered a model by other countries in recognizing the rights of self-determination and self-governance; (2) the interests of tribal nations may be further advanced and protected by adoption of such rights as U.S. policy; and (3) Congress recommends that the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. General Assembly support the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples when it comes before the General Assembly during their fall 2007 session.</summary>
