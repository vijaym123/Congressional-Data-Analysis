  <summary>9/25/2008--Passed House amended.
Expresses strong support for the work of the United States Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad and for the European countries that continue to work to preserve sacred historical sites. Expresses strong sentiments to the government of Lithuania that the people of the United States believe the Jewish cemetery located in the Snipiskes area of Vilnius, Lithuania, must not be desecrated. Calls on Lithuania to seriously consider recommendations being prepared by an international experts group on the basis of the geophysical survey of the cemetery and to guarantee the permanent preservation of the cemetery site, including the possibility of placing the land under government ownership. Declares that constructive bilateral relations between Lithuania and the United States are important to the governments, citizens, and shared agendas of both countries.</summary>
