  <summary>4/18/2007--Introduced.
States that the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security should: (1) use every tool available to them to secure the borders against illegal entry; (2) seek state and local law enforcement assistance in enforcing immigration laws; and (3) warn Mexico that any further actions it takes to encourage illegal immigration to the United States will be viewed as interference with our domestic laws in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. States that the President should announce that he will oppose any proposal to grant legal status or amnesty to illegal aliens.</summary>
