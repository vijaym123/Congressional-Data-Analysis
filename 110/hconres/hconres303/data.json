Recognizes: (1) the need to begin early intervention services soon after a child has been diagnosed; (2) that individuals with autism should have the opportunity to lead rewarding lives; (3) the shortage of appropriately trained professionals; and (4) the importance of worker training programs tailored to the needs of developmentally disabled persons.Joins with members of the United Nations in promoting awareness of autism spectrum disorders in all regions of the world."
