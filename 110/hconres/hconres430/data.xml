  <summary>9/25/2008--Introduced.
Reaffirms the validity of the principles of inviolability of the borders and territorial integrity of countries as a vital instrument of U.S. foreign policy (the Stimson Doctrine). Calls upon the President to declare that the United States does not recognize territorial changes effected by force alone. Condemns the violation of territorial integrity that occurred during Russia's armed incursion into the sovereign country of Georgia, and urges Russia to withdraw its recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent countries.</summary>
