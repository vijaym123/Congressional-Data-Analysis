States that Congress believes that: (1) the military rules of engagement must allow maximum opportunity for U.S. and coalition forces to pursue the enemy in Iraq; (2) U.S. Armed Forces fighting insurgents and al Qaida terrorists in Al Anbar Province need to be reinforced as determined by military commanders; (3) the Iraq reconstruction effort must focus on projects with a small security footprint; (4) one person in Iraq must have absolute authority and responsibility for reconstruction funding; (5) the United States and its Middle Eastern allies should develop an Iraqi repatriation program; (6) terrorism has been fueled by staggering unemployment rates in Iraq and that the United States with its allies should develop an economic development plan for Baghdad and Al Anbar Province; and (7) the U.S. government should develop a program to open and revitalize the several hundred shuttered state-owned enterprises in Iraq with primary focus on Baghdad and Al Anbar Province."
