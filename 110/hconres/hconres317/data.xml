  <summary>5/6/2008--Passed House amended.
Denounces the undemocratic and illegitimate actions of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) in Burma that seek to legitimize military rule through a flawed referendum process and an undemocratic constitution. Demands the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, detained Buddhist monks, and all other political prisoners and prisoners of conscience. Denounces the SPDC for its failure to comply with U.N. recommendations and engage in tri-partite dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1990 election winning parties, and representatives of ethnic nationalities. Urges the President to: (1) call for U.N. Security Council condemnation of the undemocratic referendum process and the SPDC's flawed constitution; (2) call for a Security Council resolution instructing the regime to comply with U.N. recommendations; and (3) push for a comprehensive arms embargo against the Burmese military regime at the Security Council. Urges the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to involve itself more deeply in reaching out to the Burmese democracy movement and to work with the Security Council and the Secretary-General to promote political dialogue.</summary>
