Directs the Secretary to continue funding grants awarded through the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiatives of the Health Resources and Services Administration until the Secretary begins to provide funds for such initiative through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006. Excludes amounts expended for medical assistance for individuals with HIV/AIDS when calculating the caps for Medicaid payments to territories."
