Requires that such meetings be held biennially for each major discipline. Instructs such agencies to enforce the federal anti-discrimination laws at universities and other higher education institutions through regular compliance reviews and prompt and thorough investigation of discrimination complaints. Requires enforcement efforts to evaluate whether universities have engaged in any discrimination banned under such laws. Requires the collection storage, and publication of specified grant data composite information. Requires submission by each agency of specified reports on: (1) workshop content and attendance, along with data on the participation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and (2) the impact of such program to reduce gender bias towards women engaged in research funded by the agency."
