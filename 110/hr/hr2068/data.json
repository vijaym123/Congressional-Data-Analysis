Authorizes the Authority to increase the federal share to up to 90% of a project's total cost (to aid communities that could not otherwise meet matching funds requirements). Requires the Authority to make grants to local development districts for administrative expenses. Directs: (1) the Authority to designate distressed counties, economically strong counties, attainment counties, competitive counties, and isolated areas of distress within the region; and (2) each affected state to submit to the Authority an annual development plan for the appropriate state area within the region."
