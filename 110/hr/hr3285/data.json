    "text": "Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2007 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to require the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to conduct a study that: (1) describes the science concerning the disease mechanisms and health effects of exposure to asbestos and other biopersistent durable fibers and methods for measuring and analyzing asbestos; (2) describes labeling practices relating to asbestos-containing material; and (3) recommends future asbestos-related disease research and exposure assessment practice needs. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations that prohibit the importing, manufacturing, processing, or distributing of asbestos-containing products, subject to limited exemption upon petition and specified exemptions sought by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).Requires the disposal of asbestos-containing products within two years. Exempts products that are no longer in the stream of commerce or that are in the possession of an end user.Requires the Administrator to establish a plan to: (1) increase awareness of the dangers posed by asbestos-containing products and contaminants in homes and workplaces and by asbestos-related diseases; (2) provide information to, and encourage participation in research and treatment endeavors by, asbestos-related disease patients and their families and front-line health care providers; and (3) encourage health care providers and researchers to provide to patients and their families information relating to research, diagnostic, and clinical treatments relating to asbestos.Amends the Public Health Service Act to: (1) direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand and coordinate research programs on diseases caused by asbestos exposure, particularly mesothelioma, asbestosis, and pleural injuries; (2) provide for establishment of a national clearinghouse for data and specimens relating to asbestos-related diseases; (3) require the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to establish an asbestos-related disease research and treatment network; and (4) direct the Secretary to support research on mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases that is directly relevant to the health of the Armed Forces."
