  <summary>6/19/2008--Passed House amended.
Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel Remediation Act of 2008 - Amends the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 to repeal a provision requiring construction of a water treatment plant to treat effluent discharged from the Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel, Colorado. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the implementation of the operable unit 6 remedy for the California Gulch Superfund Site, as defined in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2003 Record of Decision for such unit, by: (1) treating water behind any blockage or bulkhead in the Tunnel; and (2) managing and maintaining the mine pool behind such blockage or bulkhead at a level that precludes surface runoff and releases and minimizes the potential for Tunnel failure due to excessive water pressure.Requires the Secretary to take necessary steps to repair or maintain the Tunnel's structural integrity to prevent Tunnel failure and to preclude uncontrolled release of water from the Tunnel.</summary>
