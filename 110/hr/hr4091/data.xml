Specifies related requirements.Prohibits adoption assistance to parents with respect to a child who is not a U.S. citizen or resident, and who was adopted outside of the United States or brought into the United States for the purposes of being adopted.Expresses the sense of the Congress that the states should reinvest in child welfare programs any savings resulting from the implementation of this Act.</summary>
