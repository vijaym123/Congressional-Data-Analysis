    "text": "Accountability and Transparency in Ethics Act - Establishes an independent Investigations Commission within the legislative branch. Requires annual ethics training for Members and employees of the House of Representatives and for registered lobbyists. Amends Rule XXV (Limitations on Outside Earned Income and Acceptance of Gifts) of the Rules of the House to require advance authorization by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of any privately-funded trip by any Member, officer, or employee of the House. Amends such Rule and Rule XXXV (Gifts) of the Standing Rules of the Senate with respect to: (1) the market value of a flight on an airplane not licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate for compensation or hire; (2) a ban on gifts worth less than $50; and (3) disbursements for a national party convention event in honor of a Member, officer, or employee. Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA) to: (1) transfer certain functions of the Clerk of the House to the Committee with respect to registration of lobbyists; (2) revise certain registration and disclosure requirements; and (3) prescribe civil fines for lobbyists offering certain gifts to Members, officers, or employees. Amends the federal criminal code to revise the one-year ban on lobbying contacts by former Members, officers, or employees of either chamber of Congress. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit conversion of leadership PAC funds to personal use. Prohibits payment of campaign funds, except nominal reimbursements, to immediate family members of candidates. Prohibits involvement of a registered lobbyist in administration of certain campaign committees unless a candidate for federal office. Amends Rule XXIII (Code of Official Conduct) of the Rules of the House and Rule XXXVII (Conflict of Interest) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to require a Member of Congress or Senator to prohibit all of his or her staff from having any official contact with the Member's or Senator's spouse or immediate family member if such individual is a registered lobbyist or is employed or retained by one to influence legislation. Expresses the sense of Congress that the use of a family relationship by a lobbyist who is an immediate family member of a Member of Congress to gain special advantages over other lobbyists is inappropriate."
