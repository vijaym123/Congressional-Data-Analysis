Qualifies as an eligible entity any public housing agency, state or local government (or agency), community health center, home care provider organization, faith-based organization, labor organization, or other organization meeting specified criteria. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to require the Secretary to: (1) ensure low- and very low-income persons, residing within a home-based health services public housing project, opportunities for training and employment arising in connection with such project; and (2) award contracts to businesses that provide such training and employment opportunities."
