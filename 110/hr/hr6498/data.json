Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to: (1) conduct an analysis of the public health impact of direct-to-consumer marketing of genetic tests; and (2) expand efforts to educate the public about genomics and its health applications.Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a companion diagnostic tax credit for qualified diagnostic tests designed to provide information that can be used to increase the safety or effectiveness of a drug."
