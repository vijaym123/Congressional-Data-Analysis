Repeals a prohibition against implementing a project unless the nonfederal sponsor agrees to maintain aggregate expenditures from all other sources for remediation programs in the area of concern or above the average level of such expenditures in the two fiscal years preceding the date the project is initiated.Authorizes appropriations through FY2010 for: (1) such remediation projects; (2) a public information program to provide information relating to such remediation; and (3) the development and use of innovative approaches, technologies, and techniques for such remediation. Limits to 20% of the amount of funds appropriated for remediation projects that may be used for site characterization."
