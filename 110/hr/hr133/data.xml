Citizenship Reform Act of 2007 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to limit automatic citizenship at birth to a child born in the United States who was born: (1) in wedlock in the United States to a parent who is a U.S. citizen or national or is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who maintains such residence; (2) out of wedlock in the United States to a mother who is a U.S. citizen or national or is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who maintains such residence; or (3) out of wedlock in the United States to a father who is a U.S. citizen or national or is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who maintains such residence, but only if a blood relationship between the father and the child is established by clear and convincing evidence, the father had U.S. nationality or was a U.S. permanent resident at the time of the child's birth, the father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for the child until the child reaches 18, and, while the child is under 18, the father either acknowledges paternity under oath or paternity is established in court. Defines "born in wedlock" to exclude common law marriages.</summary>
