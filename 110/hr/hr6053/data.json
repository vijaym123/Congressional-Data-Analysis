Declares that the promotion of price stability should be the primary long-term goal of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to revise the mandate of the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee to require them to: (1) establish a numerical definition of the term \"price stability\"; and (2) maintain a monetary policy that promotes long-term price stability. Requires the Board to consult with, and report to, Congress semi-annually about Board and Committee objectives and plans to achieve and maintain price stability. Repeals the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978."
