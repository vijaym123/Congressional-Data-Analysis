Makes special rules for presidential and vice presidential travel. Applies this Act to travel by Members of the House of Representatives. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require political committee reimbursement of certain state and local government security costs resulting from attendance by a covered executive branch official, other than the President or Vice President, at a political campaign or fundraising event."
