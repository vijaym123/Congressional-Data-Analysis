Requires the Task Force to make recommendations to the Secretary on: (1) how to more effectively serve such needs; (2) how to promote recommended new programs and services; (3) creation of a permanent advisory board and establishment of an Internet website to receive and dispense relevant information and resources; and (4) development of additional education materials and programs. Requires the Task Force to organize and distribute existing materials that inform and educate with respect to such energy needs of the forest product industry and similar manufacturing operations."
