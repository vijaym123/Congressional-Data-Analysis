  <summary>7/31/2008--Passed House amended.
Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act of 2008 - Amends the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, with respect to lead-based paint hazards in housing, to set the environmental intervention blood lead level as equal to the lower of: (1) ten micrograms of lead per deciliter; or (2) the elevated blood lead level of concern for a child under six years of age recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to amend related regulations to comply with this Act within 90 days. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the status of the Department of Housing and Urban Development "Big Buy" program, and any other voluntary programs the Secretary has implemented or has planned to implement, through which the Secretary has conducted, or planned to conduct, lead evaluations. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009. Denies that this Act creates any obligation or requirement on the part of any owner of housing, public housing agency, or other party (besides the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) to comply with any new obligations established by or pursuant to this Act, except to the extent that the Secretary makes funds available to the owner, agency, or party for the costs of compliance.</summary>
