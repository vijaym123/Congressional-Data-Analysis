Requires the hearing to be held in a statistical metropolitan area at a location reasonably central to the affected areas, if a facility affects multiple areas. Instructs FERC to hold such a hearing whenever a request for reconsideration is granted, if FERC did not hold a hearing before issuing the permit or authorization."
