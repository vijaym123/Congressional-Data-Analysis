  <summary>7/31/2007--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), before issuing a permit or other authorization for any action that may affect land use in any locality, to hold a public hearing in that locality, if requested by five or more individuals or an organization representing 30 or more individuals. Requires the hearing to be held in a statistical metropolitan area at a location reasonably central to the affected areas, if a facility affects multiple areas. Instructs FERC to hold such a hearing whenever a request for reconsideration is granted, if FERC did not hold a hearing before issuing the permit or authorization.</summary>
