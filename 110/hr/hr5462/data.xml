  <summary>2/14/2008--Introduced.
Prohibits any federal funds from being provided to a state, city, county, or other political subdivision thereof if the Secretary of Defense determines that such state or political subdivision prohibits or unreasonably restricts, through zoning requirements more restrictive than those imposed on most small businesses in that jurisdiction, the ability of the Armed Forces to establish and operate a military recruiting office. Requires the Secretary to notify the President and Congress of each such determination.</summary>
