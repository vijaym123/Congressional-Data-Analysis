Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish an Alexander Creek account, the funds of which shall be available to Alexander Creek, Incorporated for bidding on and purchasing property sold at public sale. Directs the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to enter into negotiations to attempt to conclude a land exchange to acquire the surface estate in lands not within any conservation system unit from the State of Alaska or the Mantanuska-Susitna Borough to enable Alexander Creek to select additional public lands within Alexander Creek's original withdrawal area in Alaska. Requires the: (1) the account's initial balance to be the fair market value of the surface estate of certain deficiency selections made by Alexander Creek; and (2) subsurface estate to the lands conveyed to Alexander Creek to be conveyed to Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated.
