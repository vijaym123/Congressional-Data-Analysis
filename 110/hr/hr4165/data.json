Authorizes the Secretary to award: (1) competitive grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) for the enhancement of their existing modeling and simulation programs; and (2) grants to IHEs for the establishment of such programs. Requires grantees to raise, from nonfederal sources, an amount equal to 25% of their grants."
