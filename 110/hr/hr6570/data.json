    "text": "New Alternative Transportation to Give Americans Solutions Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that 10% of new vehicles sold in the United States should be natural gas vehicles by December 31, 2018. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) increase the rate of the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property tax credit with respect to natural gas fuel; (2) allow new tax credits for investment in energy security bonds and natural gas vehicle production bonds; (3) allow a new tax credit for producing vehicles fueled by natural gas or liquified natural gas; (4) allow an increased alternative motor vehicle tax credit for the purchase of vehicles fueled by natural gas or liquified natural gas; and (5) extend through 2017 the tax credits for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property expenditures and for new qualified alternative fuel vehicles.Requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to study whether the federal fleet should increase the number of its natural gas vehicles. Requires each retail automotive fueling station owned by a major integrated oil company to have at least one pump dispensing natural gas for automotive purposes by January 1, 2018. Imposes a civil fine on oil companies that fail to comply with such requirement."
