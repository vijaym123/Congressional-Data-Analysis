  <summary>6/22/2007--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat as ordinary income (i.e., income taxed at regular income tax rates) income received by a partner from an investment services partnership interest. Defines "investment services partnership interest" as any interest in a partnership held by a person who provides services to a partnership by: (1) advising the partnership as to the value of specified assets (e.g., real estate, commodities, or options or derivative contracts); (2) advising the partnership about investing in, purchasing, or selling specified assets; (3) managing, acquiring, or disposing of specified assets; or (4) arranging financing with respect to acquiring specified assets.</summary>
