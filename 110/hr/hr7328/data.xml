  <summary>12/10/2008--Introduced.
Homeowners' Protection Act of 2008 - Amends the federal bankruptcy code to eliminate the pre-petition credit counseling requirement for a debtor under chapter 13 (Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income) who is facing foreclosure, if the debtor submits to the court a certification that the debtor has received notice that the holder of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence may commence foreclosure. Allows modification of the rights of claim holders, in the event of a foreclosure notice for a chapter 13 debtor, among other means by: (1) reducing a claim to equal the value of the debtor's interest in the residence securing such claim, and any adjustments to a related adjustable rate of interest; (2) waiving early repayment or prepayment penalties; and (3) extending the repayment period. Denies debtor liability for certain fees and charges incurred while the bankruptcy case is pending and arising from a debt secured by the debtor's principal residence, unless the claim holder observes specified requirements. Adds to conditions for court confirmation of a plan in bankruptcy that: (1) the holder of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence retain the lien securing the claim until the later of the payment of such claim as reduced and modified or the discharge of a debtor from all debts; and (2) the plan modifies the claim in good faith. Excludes from final discharge of a debtor from all debts: (1) any payments to claim holders whose rights are modified under this Act; and (2) any unpaid portion of a claim as reduced.</summary>
