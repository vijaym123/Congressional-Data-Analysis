  <summary>3/29/2007--Introduced.
Credit Union Small Business Lending Act - Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to exclude from the meaning of "member business loan," and thereby from specified limitations on member business loans made by a credit union, certain small business loans made in cooperation with the Small Business Administration (SBA), without regard to whether any portion of such a loan is or is not SBA-guaranteed. Amends the Small Business Act to direct the SBA Administrator to implement a program to: (1) provide outreach and assistance to credit unions to increase their participation in the SBA small business loan program; (2) simplify the application process for such participation; and (3) provide a guaranty of up to 85% for loans made by credit unions to their members in underserved areas.</summary>
