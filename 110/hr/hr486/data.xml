Defines leadership PAC as a political committee which is: (1) directly or indirectly established, maintained, or controlled by a candidate for election for federal office or an individual holding federal office; but (2) is not an authorized committee of the candidate or individual. Excludes from the meaning of leadership PAC any political committee of a political party</summary>
