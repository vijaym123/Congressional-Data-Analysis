(Sec. 4) Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to extend the Generalized System of Preferences program through December 31, 2009.(Sec. 5) Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to extend certain customs fees for the processing of merchandise entered into the United States.(Sec. 6) Amends the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 to increase by 2% the amount in effect on the date of enactment of this Act of any corporate estimated tax installment otherwise due by a corporation with assets of not less than $1 billion in July, August, or September 2013."
