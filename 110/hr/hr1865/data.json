Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury, upon receiving notice from any eligible state on behalf of a local government that a named person owes such local government a past-due, legally enforceable tax obligation, to: (1) reduce the federal tax refunds payable to such person by the amount of such debt; (2) pay the amount of such reduction to the state for payment to the affected local government; (3) notify the state of the person's name, taxpayer identification number, address, and the amount collected; and (4) notify the person due the refund that it has been reduced by an amount necessary to satisfy a past-due, legally enforceable tax obligation. Requires the Secretary to select between three and five states to participate in the pilot program, including from among: (1) Illinois; (2) Iowa; (3) Louisiana; (4) New York; (5) Ohio; and (6) Virginia. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit disclosure of taxpayer information to agencies of states requesting refund offsets for tax debts owed to local governments."
