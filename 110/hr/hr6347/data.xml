HOPE VI Amendment Act of 2008 - Continues through September 30, 2009, the availability of amounts appropriated for FY2002 for grants to certain public housing agencies for public housing demolition, site revitalization, replacement housing, and tenant-based assistance (HOPE VI grants). Makes eligible for such continued grant availability any public housing agencies that since October 1, 2002, have suffered project delays, and cost increases due to shortages in labor and materials, as a result of natural catastrophes, fire, flood, explosion, or the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis.</summary>
