  <summary>11/13/2007--Introduced.
Veterans Homelessness Prevention Act - Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish a pilot program to provide assistance to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives to expand the supply of supportive housing for certain very low-income veteran families. Allows such assistance to be in the form of: (1) a grant for costs of planning a supportive housing project; (2) a capital advance for such project; and (3) project rental assistance. Requires the Secretary to coordinate with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that any housing assistance provided to veterans or veteran families includes a range of services tailored to the needs of very low-income veteran families. Requires HUD periodically to establish development cost limitations by market area for various types and sizes of such supportive housing. Establishes a special housing account. Requires the owner of such supportive housing to adopt HUD-approved tenant selection procedures. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to extend to all homeless veterans, regardless of medical condition, the program of rental vouchers for Department of Veterans Affairs supported housing, which is currently limited to homeless veterans who have chronic mental illnesses or chronic substance use disorders.</summary>
