    "text": "Forewarn Act of 2007 - Amends the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the Act) to redefine the terms \"employer,\" \"plant closing,\" and \"mass layoff\" for purposes of the Act to, among other things, make the Act applicable to employers of 50 or more employees (under current law, 100 employees). Requires an employer to: (1) give 90-day written notice (under current law, 60-day) to employees and appropriate state and government officials before ordering a plant closing or mass layoff; and (2) give notice of such closing or layoff to the Secretary of Labor (including the number of employees), to U.S. and state Senators and Representatives who represent the area in which the plant is located, and to the Governor of the state in which the plant is located and to the chief elected official of the unit of local government within such closing or layoff is to occur. Revises criteria used in determining whether a plant closing or mass layoff has occurred or will occur. Makes an employer who violates such notice requirements liable to the employee for two days of pay multiplied by the number of days short of the 90-days notice provided before such closing or layoff (under current law, for back pay) for each day of the violation for up to 90 days (under current law, 60 days). Authorizes the Secretary to bring a civil action on behalf of one or more employees for certain relief under the Act. Directs the Secretary to make educational materials concerning employee rights and employer responsibilities available to the general public and employers."
