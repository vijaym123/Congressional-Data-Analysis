Defines \"energy efficient building\" as one that after construction or renovation: (1) uses heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems that perform at no less than Energy Star standards; or (2) if Energy Star standards are not applicable, uses Federal Energy Management Program recommended heating, ventilating, and air conditioning products."
