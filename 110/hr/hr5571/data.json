(Subject to the overall limit of 30 participants per state.) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) federal programs waiving the two-year foreign residence requirement for physicians are generally designed to promote the delivery of critically needed medical services to people in the United States lacking adequate access to physician care; and (2) when determining the qualification of a location for designation as a health professional shortage area, the Secretary of Health and Human Services should consider the needs of vulnerable populations in low-income and impoverished communities, communities with high infant mortality rates, and communities exhibiting other signs of a lack of necessary physician services."
