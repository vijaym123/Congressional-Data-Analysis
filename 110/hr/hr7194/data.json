Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow certain low-income taxpayers a refundable tax credit for energy cost increases attributable to carbon regulation (climate change tax credit).Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) formulate and administer a Climate Change Rebate Program to provide monthly rebates based on energy cost increases to low-income families and families receiving federal assistance; (2) establish a schedule and standards to implement such Program.Requires receipts from the auction of greenhouse gas emission allowances to be used equally for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and the Weatherization Assistance Program under the Energy Conservation and Production Act."
