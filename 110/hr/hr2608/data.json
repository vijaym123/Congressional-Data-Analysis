Requires a sworn declaration from such aliens or victims (except children under age 18) that they have made a good faith effort to pursue U.S. citizenship.Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require the Secretary of the Treasury to offset overpayments of federal taxes by any amount owed to a state for a covered unemployment compensation debt. Defines \"covered unemployment compensation debt\" as a past-due debt (including penalties and interest) for erroneous payment of state unemployment compensation due to fraud which has become final under state law and remains uncollected for not more than 10 years. Terminates the Secretary's offset authority after 10 years.Requires states to notify by certified mail any individual who owes a covered unemployment compensation debt before taking action to offset such debt. Gives such individual 60 days to present evidence that such debt is not legally enforceable or was not incurred due to fraud. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations pertaining to such notices."
