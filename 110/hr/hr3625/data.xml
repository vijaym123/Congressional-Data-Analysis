  <summary>9/30/2007--Public Law.
Declares the sense of Congress that: (1) the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 addresses the unique situations that active duty military personnel and other affected individuals may face in connection with their enrollment in postsecondary institutions and their federal student loans; and (2) the provisions authorized by such Act should be made permanent, thereby allowing the Secretary of Education to continue providing assistance to active duty service members and other affected individuals and their families. Amends the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 to repeal the termination date of such act, thereby making permanent the Secretary's authority to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 as deemed necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency.</summary>
