Entitles students receiving such leave, upon release from active duty, to be restored to prior educational status attained without loss of academic credits earned, scholarships or grants awarded, or tuition or fees paid, unless those have been refunded. Requires institutions to give such students certain refunds of tuition or fees paid prior to active duty. Includes as active duty, in the case of National Guard members, active state duty. Excludes training or attendance at a service school from treatment as active duty."
