    "text": "Veterans Disability Benefits Claims Modernization Act of 2008 - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study on adjusting the schedule for rating veterans' disabilities in order to base such schedule on current standards, practices, and codes in common use by the medical, mental health, and disability professions. Establishes in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the Advisory Committee on Disability Compensation to consult with and advise the Secretary with respect to the maintenance and periodic readjustment of the above schedule. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study on the: (1) employee work credit system of the VA's Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), which is used to measure the work production of VBA employees; and (2) VBA work management system, with the goal of improving accountability, quality, and accuracy and reducing the time for processing claims. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop a certification examination for VBA employees and managers responsible for processing benefits claims; and (2) evaluate the training of VBA employees responsible for matters relating to veterans' compensation or pension benefits. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the use of information technology at the VBA, including the technology known as \"VistA.\" Allows a claim beneficiary to be substituted as a claimant in the case of the death of a veteran claimant while a claim is awaiting adjudication or appeal."
