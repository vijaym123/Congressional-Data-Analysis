Declares that a board of trade, exchange, or market shall not be considered to be foreign or located outside the United States if: (1) it has an affiliate located in the United States; or (2) a contract of sale of a commodity, or a significant price discovery contract, is executed or traded on such board of trade, exchange, or market."
