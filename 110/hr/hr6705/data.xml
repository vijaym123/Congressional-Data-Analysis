  <summary>7/31/2008--Introduced.
Enemy Combatant Detention Review Act of 2008 - Amends the federal judicial code to grant the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia exclusive jurisdiction of, and make it the exclusive venue for consideration of, all habeas corpus applications by or on behalf of any enemy combatant held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who is neither a U.S. citizen nor a lawful permanent resident (covered individual) that are pending on or filed on or after the enactment of this Act. Prescribes related procedures, including restrictions on oral testimony. Stays any such application until all Military Commission proceedings regarding the covered individual have been resolved. Requires release of a covered individual, for whom the District Court grants a writ of habeas corpus and orders release, into the custody of the Secretary of Homeland Security for transfer to the individual's country of citizenship or another country.</summary>
