  <summary>2/16/2007--Introduced.
Stop Obesity in Schools Act of 2007 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a national strategy to reduce childhood obesity that: (1) provides for the reduction of childhood obesity rates by 10% by the year 2011; (2) addresses short-term and long-term solutions; (3) identifies how the federal government can work effectively with entities to implement the strategy; and (4) includes measures to identify and overcome obstacles.Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to: (1) make matching grants to local educational agencies to reduce childhood obesity by adopting wellness policies and anti-obesity initiatives; (2) arrange for the evaluation of a wide variety of existing programs designed to prevent obesity in children and adolescents to determine their effectiveness, factors contributing to their effectiveness, and the feasibility of replicating the programs in other locations; and (3) make matching grants to state governments, local governments, and consortia of local governments to reduce childhood obesity through establishing or expanding healthy living and wellness coordinating councils (that are charged to increase healthy living and reduce obesity in elementary and secondary schools) and supporting regional workshops.</summary>
