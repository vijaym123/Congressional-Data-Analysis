  <summary>3/26/2007--Introduced.
Communities Building Access Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to public or nonprofit private entities to carry out demonstration projects for the purpose of making health care coverage available, on a cost-sharing basis, to: (1) employees through employers that have not contributed to health care benefits for employees during the prior 12 months; and (2) self-employed individuals who have been without such coverage during the prior 12 months. Requires the Secretary to make matching grants to public or nonprofit private entities to carry out demonstration projects for the purpose of forming and maintaining networks composed of health care specialists who volunteer health services to eligible individuals. Directs the Secretary to make an award of a grant or contract for the establishment and operation of a clearinghouse for information on demonstration projects under this Act and similar projects that are community initiated. Allows the Secretary to carry out a program to encourage public and private entities that plan or operate such projects to submit information to the clearinghouse.</summary>
