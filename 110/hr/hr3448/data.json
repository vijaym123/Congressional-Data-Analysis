Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations establishing standards and requirements regarding the sale, distribution, use, and safe disposal of substitutes for class I and class II substances.Makes it unlawful for specified persons to sell or distribute any such substitute that is suitable for use in a motor vehicle air-conditioning system and that is in a container of less than 20 pounds of such substitute.Establishes the Refrigerant Environmental Management Council as a nonprofit entity to address the emissions of fluorocarbon refrigerants in an economical, efficient, and effective manner and to lead industry in recovery, reclamation, and destruction of such refrigerants. Gives the Council authority to collect a levy on the domestic production of virgin HCFC and Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants, the import of all HCFC and HFC refrigerants, and the import of such refrigerants contained in equipment. Authorizes the Council to use the funds generated by the levies to provide incentive payments to entities that document that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs, and HFCs have been reclaimed or destroyed.Authorizes the EPA to carry out the mission and activities of the SunWise Program."
