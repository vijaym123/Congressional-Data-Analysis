  <summary>7/9/2008--Passed House amended.
Community Building Code Administration Grant Act of 2008 - Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to award $1 million grants, on a competitive basis and with federal matching funds, to qualified local building code enforcement departments to increase staffing, provide staff training, increase staff competence and professional qualifications, support individual certification or departmental accreditation, or for capital expenditures specifically dedicated to department administration. Allows the Secretary to waive specified non-federal matching fund requirements and to institute new ones, by regulation, based upon the level of economic distress of the local jurisdiction in which the local building code enforcement department seeking such grant is located. Sets forth criteria for rating and ranking of grant proposals. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2013.</summary>
