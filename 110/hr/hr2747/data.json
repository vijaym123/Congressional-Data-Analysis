Authorizes the Attorney General to make three-year grants to state and local governments to plan, develop, implement, or enhance methamphetamine precursor electronic logbook systems. Establishes a preference for grant recipients who develop electronic logbook systems that are: (1) statewide; (2) capable of real-time capture and transmission of logbook information to law enforcement and regulatory agencies; and (3) designed to share information across jurisdictional boundaries.Requires the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the effectiveness of methamphetamine precursor electronic logbook systems."
