  <summary>6/15/2007--Introduced.
Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act of 2007 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to expand electronic logbook requirements applicable to sellers and purchasers of listed chemicals (e.g., legal substances used in the production of methamphetamine). Authorizes the Attorney General to make three-year grants to state and local governments to plan, develop, implement, or enhance methamphetamine precursor electronic logbook systems. Establishes a preference for grant recipients who develop electronic logbook systems that are: (1) statewide; (2) capable of real-time capture and transmission of logbook information to law enforcement and regulatory agencies; and (3) designed to share information across jurisdictional boundaries.Requires the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the effectiveness of methamphetamine precursor electronic logbook systems.</summary>
