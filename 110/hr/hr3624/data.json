    "text": "Consumer Food Safety Act of 2007 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) administer a national program to protect human health by ensuring that the food industry has effective programs to assure the safety of food; (2) prescribe regulations regarding harmful substances in food, registration of facilities, sanitary food processing, proper labeling, processing controls, and inspections of registered facilities; (3) establish tolerances to limit the quantity of contaminants in food; (4) establish a system to ensure the safety of imported food; (5) include food in an active surveillance system; (6) establish guidelines for a sampling system of food products; (7) rank food categories based on their health hazard and identify approaches to minimize such hazards; and (8) design and implement a food safety education program. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require notification of the Secretary of any adulterated or misbranded food. Sets forth provisions regarding ceasing distribution of food, recalls, and civil penalties for violations of this Act. Prohibits any person from being discriminated against because that person participated in any way in carrying out the purpose of specified federal food laws or refused to violate any law, rule, or regulation. Allows the Secretary to impose traceability requirements on a type or class of food product as necessary to assure the protection of the public health. Allows civil actions against the Secretary for failing to perform any nondiscretionary act or duty to ensure the safety of food products."
