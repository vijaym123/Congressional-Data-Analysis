Limits an award to $500,000, adjusted to reflect the annual change in the Consumer Price Index. Bars a person who has accepted compensation under this Act from commencing or maintaining a U.S. civil action seeking compensation for such injuries or damages associated with such hostage taking against a foreign state or its agencies or instrumentalities. Funds compensation under this Act from the Hostage Victims Fund (as provided by this Act) into which the President shall direct deposits from: (1) blocked assets of terrorist parties; (2) amounts received against any person in connection with the U.N. Oil for Food Program; or (3) amounts received as a result of any fine or forfeiture in connection with a violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Trading With the Enemy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, or the Export Administration Act. Provides additional compensation for victims of the 1979 Iranian hostage taking in Tehran, including spouses and children of persons taken captive.
