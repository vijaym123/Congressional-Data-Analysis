  <summary>6/25/2007--Introduced.
Improving Classroom Learning and Student Performance Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Education to award five-year grants to states that receive funds under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to enable them to: (1) collaborate with institutions of higher education, other research institutions, and other organizations to improve the quality, validity, and reliability of state and local academic assessments, including performance assessments that evaluate the application of knowledge to real-world tasks; (2) develop the capacity of local education agencies (LEAs) to assess student academic achievement using multiple measures, including school-based performance assessments; and (3) develop, together with LEAs, the capacity of teachers and school leaders to develop, use, and reliably evaluate the results of locally-administered performance assessments. Requires state grantees to ensure that state and local assessments are aligned to learning standards, unbiased, valid for the purposes for which they are used, reliably scored, and meet professional standards.</summary>
