  <summary>8/1/2008--Introduced.
Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to authorize enforcement through a civil suit of the prohibition against the diversion or export of Great Lakes water by a state, federal agency, or private entity for use outside the Great Lakes basin unless such diversion or export is approved by the governor of each of the Great Lakes states.Allows such a civil suit to be filed by the federal government, a state or local government, or by any person or organization whose property or other legally recognized interest will be adversely affected. Makes the proper venue for such a civil suit the federal judicial district with jurisdiction over any portion of the Great Lakes Basin and from which the diversion or export of water will occur or has occurred.</summary>
