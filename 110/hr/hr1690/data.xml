Requires, with respect to the pilot program: (1) at least two of the participating airports to be large hub airports, with each of the remaining airports representing a different airport security risk category; (2) screening to be conducted under the same standards as apply to individuals at airport security screening checkpoints and to be carried out by contract screeners at a minimum of two airports; and (3) that it shall be carried out for not less than 180 days.
