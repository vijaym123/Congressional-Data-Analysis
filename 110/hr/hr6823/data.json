    "text": "Promoting Real Opportunities for Energy Security Act or the PRO Energy Security Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to acquire advanced biofuels for the purpose of filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if the average weighted price of oil exceeds $75 per barrel for three consecutive days. Defines \"advanced biofuel\" to mean renewable fuel, other than ethanol derived from corn starch, that has lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are at least 50% less than baseline lifecycle GHG emissions. Authorizes the following types of fuels to be eligible for consideration as \"advanced biofuel\": (1) ethanol derived from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin; (2) ethanol derived from sugar or starch (other than corn starch); (3) ethanol derived from waste material; (4) biomass-based diesel; (5) biogas (including landfill gas and sewage waste treatment gas) produced through the conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass; (6) butanol or other alcohols produced through the conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass; and (7) other fuel derived from cellulosic biomass.Requires the Secretary of Energy to submit to specified congressional committees a report containing: (1) a description of how the Secretary will acquire advanced biofuels for such purpose; and (2) recommendations for criteria and procedures for making advanced biofuels available from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to appropriate federal and nonfederal entities."
