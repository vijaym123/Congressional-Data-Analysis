  <summary>6/6/2007--Passed House without amendment.
10,000 Trained by 2010 Act - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to award competitive grants for basic research on innovative approaches to improve health care information systems. Requires the Director to award competitive, multi-year grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) to establish multidisciplinary Centers for Informatics Research for conducting cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research to generate innovative approaches in health care information. Allows IHEs to partner with one or more government laboratories and for-profit or nonprofit institutions. Requires the Director to convene an annual meeting of the Centers to foster collaboration and cooperation between Center participants. Requires the Director to award competitive grants to IHEs to establish or improve undergraduate and master's degree health care information programs, attract students to such programs, and provide them with experience in government or industry related to their studies. Requires the Director to evaluate this grant program within three years of establishing it. Requires the Director to award grants under the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992 for the purposes of two existing grant programs that provide funds to associate-degree-granting IHEs for: (1) improving education in advanced technology, science, and mathematics; and (2) establishing centers of excellence in such subjects that serve as information clearinghouses and models for other educational institutions. Limits the use of these new grants to improving health information education. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2011.</summary>
