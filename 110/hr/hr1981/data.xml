Requires the Assistant Secretary, if the regulations are not issued by 60 days after enactment of this Act, to prohibit the use of foreign repair stations, except in an emergency. Reduces from 18 months to 9 months after enactment of this Act the deadline for a security review and audit of foreign repair stations.</summary>
