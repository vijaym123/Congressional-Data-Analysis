  <summary>9/26/2008--Passed Senate amended.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should: (1) pursue international agreements to establish an international framework for determining the source of any confiscated nuclear or radiological material or weapon and the source of any detonated weapon and the nuclear or radiological material used in such a weapon; (2) develop protocols for the data exchange and dissemination of sensitive information relating to nuclear or radiological materials; and (3) develop expedited protocols for the data exchange and dissemination of sensitive information needed to publicly identify the source of a nuclear detonation. Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include within the mission of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to: (1) develop and implement a National Strategy and Five-Year Implementation Plan for Improving the Nuclear Forensic and Attribution Capabilities of the United States Government (Plan) and methods, capabilities, and capacity for nuclear materials forensics and attribution; (2) establish within the Office a National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center to provide centralized stewardship, planning, assessment, gap analysis, exercises, improvement, and integration for all federal nuclear forensics and attribution activities and to coordinate and implement the Plan; and (3) establish a National Nuclear Forensics Expertise Development Program devoted to developing and maintaining a vibrant and enduring academic pathway from undergraduate to post-doctorate study in nuclear and geochemical science specialties directly relevant to technical nuclear forensics. Requires the Director of the Office and each of the relevant departments that are partners in the National Technical Forensics Center to report annually to Congress and the President on: (1) each relevant agency's activities and investments in support of nuclear forensics and attribution activities; (2) the most current version of the Plan; and (3) funds allocated for authorized activities that are not spent.</summary>
