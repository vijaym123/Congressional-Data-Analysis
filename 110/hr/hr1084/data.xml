Requires specified pre-notification by the President before making assistance available. Limits: (1) program authority to FY2008-FY2010; and (2) annual fiscal year expenditures to $100 million.

Authorizes FY2007-FY2010 appropriations. Prohibits the establishment and deployment of any Civilian Reserve Corps from substantively impairing state and local capacity and readiness. Directs the Secretary to ensure the use of existing Department and USAID training and education programs. (Sec. 6) Authorizes: (1) the Secretary or the head of any U.S. agency, with respect to agency personnel, to extend to any individual assigned or deployed under this Act certain death gratuity, training, and travel benefits that are provided to Foreign Service members; and (2) the Secretary to accept detailees or assignments from other agencies and state or local employees on a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis.
