  <summary>10/31/2007--Introduced.
Amends the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act to redefine Native American to mean cultural items that have a significant and substantial genetic or cultural relationship, based on factors other than geography alone, to a presently existing tribe, people, or culture that is now indigenous to the United States. Declares that nothing in such Act shall be deemed to restrict excavation, examination, investigation, or scientific study under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 of any cultural item found on federal land that has not been determined to be the property of an Indian tribe or a Native Hawaiian organization.</summary>
