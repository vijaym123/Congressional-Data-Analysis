Includes among the amounts the Administrator is authorized to obligate from proceeds from the disposition of excess real property: (1) amounts to pay the costs related to identifying and preparing properties to be reported excess by another agency; and (2) amounts to pay the costs associated with the reversion, custody, and disposal of reverted real property.Expands requirements for the use of net proceeds from the transfer or sale of excess real property assets.Exempts in FY2009 and FY2010 certain eligible properties from requirements under the McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act for the use of public buildings to assist the homeless. Defines as "eligible property" a property (other than Department of Veteran Affairs property): (1) that is selected for demolition, located on land not determined to be excess for which there is an ongoing federal need, and not to be used in any lease, exchange, leaseback arrangement, or service agreement; and (2) that is located in an area to which the general public is denied access for national security reasons or that is uninhabitable, not a housing unit, and selected for demolition by an agency.
