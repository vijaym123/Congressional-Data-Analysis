Amends the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) to repeal provisions relating to: (1) the requirement for certain nonemployer Medicare Advantage (MA) private fee-for-service plans to use contracts with providers; (2) the moratorium on authority to designate other plans as specialized MA plans for special needs individuals; (3) the limitation on out-of-pocket costs for dual eligibles and qualified Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a specialized MA plan for special needs individuals; (4) access to Medicare reasonable cost reimbursement contract plans, especially the prohibition on extension of such a contract in certain circumstances; and (5) the requirement for a study and report to Congress by the Comptroller General of the reasons (if any) why reasonable cost contracts are unable to become MA plans. Restores the corresponding provisions of the Social Security Act as they were before the amendments made by MIPPA.</summary>
