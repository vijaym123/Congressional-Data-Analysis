Science Museum and National Laboratory Partnership Demonstration Act - Authorizes the award of up to five grants only to partnerships that include science museums, or consortia thereof serving at least 1,000,000 visitors annually and with an existing partnership with one or more national laboratories, for the purposes of : (1) increasing public understanding of scientific work occurring at the national laboratories; (2) developing exhibits and informal education programs featuring advances in the physical sciences; and (3) increasing public understanding of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. Disallows such science museums or consortia from receiving more than 60% of a grant award for any fiscal year, with the remaining funds allocated to National Laboratory partners.</summary>
