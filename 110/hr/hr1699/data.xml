  <summary>10/9/2007--Passed House amended.
Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act - (Sec. 4) Instructs the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to promulgate a final consumer product safety rule that requires manufacturers of durable infant or toddler products to: (1) provide consumers with a postage-paid consumer registration form with each such product; (2) maintain a record of registered consumer contact information to improve the effectiveness of product recalls; (3) permanently place the manufacturer name and contact information, model name and number, and the date of manufacture on each durable infant or toddler product; and (4) implement specified recordkeeping and notification requirements. Requires the CPSC to study and report to Congress regarding the effectiveness of the registration forms in facilitating recalls.</summary>
