  <summary>5/24/2007--Introduced.
Voluntary Public Access and Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program Act of 2007 - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a program under which states and tribal governments may apply for grants to encourage owners and operators of privately-held farm, ranch, and forest land to voluntarily make such land available for public access for wildlife-dependent recreation (including hunting or fishing) under state- and tribally-administered plans. Amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to exclude from excess base acreage computation for direct and counter-cyclical payment purposes certain conservation enrolled farm land not planted in an agricultural commodity.</summary>
