Directs the President to brief each member of the congressional intelligence committees on: (1) the Terrorist Surveillance Program of the National Security Agency (NSA); and (2) any program which involves the electronic surveillance of U.S. persons in the United States for foreign intelligence purposes which is conducted by any federal department or entity without fully complying with the prescribed federal law provisions. Amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) concerning electronic surveillance to: (1) extend the period for the application for orders for emergency electronic surveillance; (2) increase the number of judges with jurisdiction to hear applications for and grant orders approving electronic surveillance within the United States; and (3) provide for the acquisition of foreign communications between or among non-U.S. persons. Provides for the implementation of a document management system for, and authorizes additional personnel for the preparation and consideration of, electronic surveillance applications. Expands electronic surveillance authority under specified conditions, including when Congress is unable to convene because of an attack upon the United States. Repeals the Protect America Act. States that on December 31, 2009: (1) this Act shall cease to have effect; and (2) the provisions of law amended by this Act are amended to read as they read before this Act's enactment."
