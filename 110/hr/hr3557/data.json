    "text": "Restore American Dream Act of 2007 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish tax-exempt homeownership plans. Allows a tax deduction from gross income for cash contributions to such plans. Defines \"homeownership plan\" as a trust established for the exclusive purpose of paying the costs (e.g., downpayment, interest, mortgage insurance, closing costs, etc.) of acquiring a principal residence by an individual who has never owned a principal residence. Excludes from gross income distributions from a homeownership plan used to pay the costs of acquiring a principal residence. Sets forth rules governing: (1) transfers of an interest in a plan due to death or divorce; (2) penalties for making distributions from a plan for purposes other than to acquire a principal residence; and (3) employer homeownership plans established for the benefit of their employees."
