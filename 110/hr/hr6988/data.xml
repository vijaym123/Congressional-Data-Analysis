Wildlife Penning Prohibition Act - Amends the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to add wildlife, other than birds, used or intended to be used in dog training activities (i.e., activities in which coyotes, foxes, or other wildlife species are pursued, harassed, or killed within an enclosure) to the definition of "prohibited wildlife species" for purposes of the prohibition against the sale or purchase of such species in interstate or foreign commerce. Makes it unlawful for a person to sell or purchase a live animal of any prohibited wildlife species in interstate or foreign commerce (i.e., for pet trade purposes). Sets forth: (1) exceptions to such prohibition; and (2) civil and criminal penalties for violations of the requirements of this Act.</summary>
