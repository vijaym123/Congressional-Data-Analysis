Establishes a Joint Select Committee on Earmark Reform to study and report on the practices of Congress and the executive branch regarding earmarks in appropriations, tax, and tariff measures.Declares it not in order in the 110th Congress to consider legislation containing a congressional earmark, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit.Requires a reduction in the allocation of new budget authority and outlays for FY2009."
