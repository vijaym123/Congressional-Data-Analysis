Requires: (1) the average annual price per gallon to be based solely on data reported by the Energy Information Administration; and (2) that price to serve as the baseline fuel cost for each District.Requires FEMA to reimburse a qualified volunteer fire department for 75% of the difference between: (1) the actual expenditures of the department for gasoline and diesel fuel for a year; and (2) the amount that such expenditures would have been using the baseline fuel costs. Directs each qualified volunteer fire department seeking reimbursement to submit to the FEMA at the end of each year: (1) all of its receipts and bills of sales documenting the amounts of gasoline and diesel fuel purchased during that year; and (2) a sum total of the aggregate number of gallons and the costs of gasoline and diesel fuel purchased."
