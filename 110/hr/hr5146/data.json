    "text": "Invest in Energy Security Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 governing petroleum acquisition for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to direct the Secretary of Energy to: (1) sell specified quantities of petroleum received under the royalty-in-kind program; and (2) suspend petroleum acquisition for the SPR under such program. Authorizes the Secretary to resume such acquisition upon notifying Congress that specified circumstances exist, and to suspend acquisition again if certain other circumstances arise. Establishes the Energy Independence and Security Fund to receive all proceeds from sales of SPR petroleum. Allocates amounts from such Fund for: (1) the Energy Transformation Acceleration Fund for university-based research projects and program direction expenses; (2) Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy account for rural wind energy systems; (3) solar energy technologies; (4) weatherization assistance for low-income housing; (5) ocean and wave energy, including hydrokinetic renewable energy; (6) technologies to improve the energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes and from buildings; (7) improvements to the energy efficiency of transportation and electric power; (8) geothermal research and development managed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory; (9) advanced geothermal drilling and resource characterization managed by National Energy Technology Laboratory; (10) carbon capture and storage; (11) Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional Natural Gas and Other Petroleum Research Fund; (12) environmental research in support of small producers of domestic petroleum and natural gas, for regulatory analysis and for support for the stripper well consortium; and (13) the H-Prize Program of the Department of Energy."
