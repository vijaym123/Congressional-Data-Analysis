Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include among nonimmigrant classifications: (1) an alien seeking to enter the United States temporarily and solely to receive medical treatment (including participation in a research study) for a disease or condition that if untreated threatens to undermine the alien's survival or day-to-day functioning with an increased likelihood of progression to a more severe disease or condition; or (2) such alien's accompanying or following son, daughter, spouse, or parent. Sets forth related conditions of admission.</summary>
