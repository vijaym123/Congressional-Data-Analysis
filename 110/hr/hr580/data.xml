  <summary>3/26/2007--Passed House amended.
Amends the federal judicial code to provide for a person appointed as U.S. attorney to serve until the earlier of: (1) the qualification of a U.S. attorney for such district appointed by the President (as under current law); or (2) the expiration of 120 days after appointment by the Attorney General. Authorizes the U.S. district court for the particular district, if such a 120-day temporary appointment expires, to appoint a U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled. States that this Act is the exclusive means for appointing a person to perform temporarily the functions of a U.S. attorney for a district in which the office of a U.S. attorney is vacant.</summary>
