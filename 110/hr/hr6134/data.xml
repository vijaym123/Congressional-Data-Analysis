Requires the President to recommend changes to renewable fuel standards based upon the findings of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study of the impact of the renewable fuel program on producers of feed grains, livestock, food, forest products, and energy when the Secretary of Energy submits it to Congress.Requires the Secretary to enter into an arrangement with NAS to assess the impact of federal and state requirements to use ethanol on such producers and producers of other consumer goods.Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for reductions in the ethanol blender credits for ethanol derived from corn kernels, soybeans, or any other substances that are suitable for human food or livestock feed consumption.</summary>
