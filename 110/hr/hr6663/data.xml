  <summary>7/30/2008--Introduced.
Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Clarification and Implementation Act of 2008 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the Attorney General should focus prosecutorial efforts on persons who: (1) offer Internet sports betting in the United States; or (2) process payments for illegal Internet sports betting in the United States. Amends federal law governing prohibited funding of unlawful Internet gambling to declare that no person shall be subject to criminal liability arising out of certain bets or wagers by means of the Internet. Defines criminal liability to include actions against real or personal property that arise from or depend upon the allegedly criminal nature of the bet or wager or of the transmission or receipt of funds in connection with that bet or wager.</summary>
