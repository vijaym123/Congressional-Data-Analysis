Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the potential for additional exchanges from the SPR. Establishes in the Treasury the Energy Independence and Security Fund. Instructs the Secretary to distribute amounts from the Fund to specified energy activities, including: (1) energy research of the Advanced Research Projects Agency; (2) wind and solar energy research and development; (3) low-income weatherization; (4) advanced vehicles research, development, demonstration; and (5) smart grid technology research and development."
