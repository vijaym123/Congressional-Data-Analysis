Requires such regulations to include: (1) procedures for the Secretary to provide exemptions to the prohibition where the Secretary finds that it is not technically feasible to serve a specialized lighting application, such as a military, medical, or public safety application; and (2) civil penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Secretary to transmit to Congress a plan for encouraging and providing incentives for the domestic production of more efficient light bulbs by U.S. manufacturers."
