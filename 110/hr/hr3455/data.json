Requires the Secretary, in any case in which such period is exceeded or in which transportation was not so provided, to promptly provide for such care or transportation from a private source and to reimburse such source at an appropriate rate. Requires expedited reimbursement procedures. Directs the Secretary to include within standards of performance used for measuring VA medical care administration a standard of assessing improvements in appointment waiting times."
