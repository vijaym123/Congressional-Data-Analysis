Clark, and subsequent orders of that court. Requires: (1) the Secretary to pay to the Tribe's governing body for programming purposes each per capita payment of an eligible member of the Delaware Tribe identified as underpaid in an amount that is less than $5; and (2) any amounts remaining one year after 80% of the initial distributions have been made to be provided to the governing body for such purposes.Finds that a December 3, 1940 letter of the Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs, approved by Assistant Secretary Chapman for the Department of the Interior on January 23, 1941, determined that the Tribe was eligible to organize as a separate tribe under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act. Provides that if the Tribe elects to be, and is, reorganized by the Secretary under that Act, such restoration shall be subject to specified provisions regarding the resolution of issues between the Delaware Tribe and the Cherokee Nation."
