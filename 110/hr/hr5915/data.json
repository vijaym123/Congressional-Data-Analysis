    "text": "Screening Applied Fairly and Equitably to Truckers Act of 2008, or the SAFE Truckers Act of 2008 - Amends the Homeland Security Act 2002 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) designate security sensitive material; and (2) prohibit an individual from operating a motor vehicle in commerce while transporting such material, unless the operator of the motor vehicle holds a transportation security card issued by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to prohibit a person (shipper) from offering a security sensitive material for transportation by motor vehicle, or causing the transportation of such material by motor vehicle, unless the operator of the motor vehicle holds a transportation security card. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for persons who violate the requirements of this Act. Prohibits a motor vehicle registered in Mexico or Canada from transporting security sensitive material in U.S. commerce until the operator of the motor vehicle has undergone a background records check similar to that required for U.S. commercial motor vehicle operators licensed to transport security sensitive materials in U.S. commerce. Requires the Secretary to conduct periodically a named-based background check against the U.S. integrated terrorism watch list of all individuals licensed to operate a motor vehicle to transport a hazardous material in commerce. Establishes task forces on: (1) highway security; and (2) crimes disqualifying individuals from certain transportation-related employment."
