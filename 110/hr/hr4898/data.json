Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to repeal authority for the Fund for the Improvement of Education: (1) educational, cultural, apprenticeship, and exchange programs for Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and their historical whaling and trading partners in Massachusetts; and (2) program of grants to a national nonprofit educational organization for the improvement of student understanding of personal finance and economics through effective teaching of economics in the nation's classrooms."
