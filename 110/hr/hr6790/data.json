Revises the requirement that the NRC give priority consideration to counseling intermediaries and legal organizations that provide legal assistance in the 100 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with the highest home foreclosure rates. Requires the NRC, in the case of any of such MSAs which do not have adequate counseling intermediaries and legal organizations providing such legal assistance, to give priority consideration to counseling intermediaries and legal organizations that: (1) do provide such legal assistance in areas near such MSA; and (2) have the capacity to provide it also in such MSA."
