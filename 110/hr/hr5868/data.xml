  <summary>4/22/2008--Introduced.
Caleb Martin-Travis Dodson Wounded Warrior Retention Act - Authorizes a member of the Armed Forces who would normally be retired, placed on the temporary disability retired list, or separated as the result of a combat-related disability to elect to instead be retained on active service in an active status, as long as the member: (1) remains medically able to perform noncombat-related military occupational specialties or duties; and (2) is not disqualified from performing such specialties or duties because of performance, mandatory retirement for age, or other reasons. Subjects members placed in such status to periodic physical examinations, as provided to members placed on the temporary disability retired list. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to permit, on a case-by-case basis, the reenlistment or appointment in such status of a member who, during the period beginning on September 1, 2001, and ending on the date of enactment of this Act, was retired or separated as the result of a combat-related disability. Requires a report from the Secretary to Congress on the number and types of noncombat-related military occupational specialties in the Armed Forces and Department of Defense (DOD) civilian employee positions that would be available for such members.</summary>
