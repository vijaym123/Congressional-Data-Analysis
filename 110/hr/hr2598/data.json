Declares that an expenditure made by a political party committee may not be considered to have been made in concert or cooperation with a candidate or an agent or authorized committee of the candidate solely because the candidate has requested that the committee not make any expenditure in support of the candidate or in opposition to an opponent of the candidate. (That is, a political party committee expenditure in support of a candidate, or in opposition to an opponent, may not be disqualified as an independent expenditure solely because the candidate has communicated to the committee a request that it not make such expenditures.)"
