Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to revise factors that the United States International Trade Commission must consider in making material injury determinations in countervailing duty and antidumping duty proceedings to additionally require that the Commission make such determinations without regard to: (1) whether other imports are likely to replace subject imports; or (2) the effect of a potential order on the domestic industry."
