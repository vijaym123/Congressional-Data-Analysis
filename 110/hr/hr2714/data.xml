  <summary>6/14/2007--Introduced.
Amends the Uruguay Round Agreements Act to direct the President to delay or reverse the implementation of a decision of a dispute settlement panel or the Appellate Body that is adverse to the United States involving the calculation of dumping margins and weighted average dumping margins (zeroing decisions) until the United States has obtained clarification of rights and obligations within World Trade Organization (WTO) multilateral negotiations such that historic practices of the United States are permitted in antidumping duty investigations, reviews of antidumping duty orders, and under any other phase of an antidumping duty proceeding. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to revise factors that the United States International Trade Commission must consider in making material injury determinations in countervailing duty and antidumping duty proceedings to additionally require that the Commission make such determinations without regard to: (1) whether other imports are likely to replace subject imports; or (2) the effect of a potential order on the domestic industry.</summary>
