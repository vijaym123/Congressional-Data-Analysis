  <summary>3/21/2007--Introduced.
Holds a state, and its local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools, harmless from sanctions under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 relating to academic assessments for the 2006-2007 school year if they meet certain criteria. Specifies such criteria as follows: (1) the state had at least one approved academic assessment plan for the 2005-2006 school year; (2) the state had at least one such plan subsequently held invalid by the Department of Education for the 2006-2007 school year; and (3) the state's Governor certifies, in writing, that the state cannot effectively train its educators on a new or alternative assessment before its administration, and that the administration of a new or alternative assessment is not in the best interest of the public school system and the children it serves.</summary>
