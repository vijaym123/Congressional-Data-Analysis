    "text": "Clean Energy Partnership with India Act of 2008 - Establishes in the legislative branch the Congressional Commission on Renewable Power Technology Commerce with India to: (1) study methods for improvement and promotion of bilateral renewable energy cooperation between the United States and India; and (2) recommend to Congress and the President methods and strategies to develop joint energy policy between the United States and India for reliable energy throughout India using renewable, environmentally-friendly means of production. Requires the Secretary of State to report to Congress on: (1) the extent to which energy is reliably available in India and what portion of it is produced through renewable means; (2) estimated investment, export, and job creation potential if U.S. industry plays a central role in the production and distribution of renewable energy in India; (3) estimated economic benefits and poverty reduction that would result if India's energy needs were met through renewable energy; (4) the estimated level of greenhouse gasses that India would produce in the coming years if it did not pursue renewable means of energy production; and (5) recommendations for the federal government and the private sector regarding technical assistance with the investment, production, and distribution of renewable energy in India. Directs the President to seek to establish a permanent joint renewable energy council between the United States and India to advise the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of India on promotion of environmentally sustainable economic growth in India and the United States through public policy regarding investment, production, and distribution of renewable energy in India."
