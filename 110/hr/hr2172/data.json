Requires the Secretary to contract with a non-VA entity for the service and repair of prosthetic devices for a veteran if: (1) the Secretary determines that VA facilities are unable to perform such service or repair due to a lack of technology or any other reason; or (2) the veteran needing such service or repair resides more than 55 miles from the nearest VA facility capable of furnishing such service or repair. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and carry out a plan to inform disabled veterans at least twice a year of technological advances in the field of prosthetics; (2) review all VA orthotic-prosthetic laboratories and clinics to ensure that the VA is capable of servicing and repairing the most technologically advanced prosthetic devices; and (3) review VA prosthetists and orthotists to determine the level and kinds of education required to ensure their qualification to provide the most technologically advanced prosthetic devices."
