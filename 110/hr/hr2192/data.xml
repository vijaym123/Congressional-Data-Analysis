Establishes in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) an Office of the Ombudsman, headed by a Director. Outlines Office and Director duties, including: (1) serving as a last resort for veterans' health care and benefits complaints and issues that cannot be resolved at a local or regional level; and (2) maintaining a public website with contact information for each patient advocate at each VA medical center. Requires the Director to: (1) appoint three regional administrators to support VHA facilities and veterans integrated service networks in their patient advocacy activities; and (2) establish a board to hear appeals from veterans dissatisfied with efforts of their local medical center and service network, and issue letters outlining possible solutions. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to designate the Ombudsman within 180 days after enactment of this Act.</summary>
