Declares that nothing in this Act creates federal water rights or requires the grant of water rights to federal entities.(Sec. 106) Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 107) Terminates the Secretary's authority to implement the First Increment on September 30, 2020.Tittle II: Pathfinder Modification Project - (Sec. 201) Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, to: (1) modify the Pathfinder Dam and Reservoir; and (2) enter one or more agreements with the state of Wyoming to implement the Pathfinder Modification Project.
