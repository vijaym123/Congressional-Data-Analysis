    "text": "Internet Spyware (I-SPY) Prevention Act of 2007 - (Sec. 2) Amends the federal criminal code to impose a fine and/or prison term of up to five years for intentionally accessing a protected computer (a computer exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the U.S. government or which is used in or affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication) without authorization, or exceeding authorized access, by causing a computer program or code to be copied onto the protected computer and intentionally using that program or code in furtherance of another federal criminal offense.Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to two years if such unauthorized access of a protected computer is for the purpose of: (1) intentionally obtaining or transmitting personal information (including a Social Security number or other government-issued identification number, a bank or credit card number, or an associated password or access code) with intent to defraud or injure a person or cause damage to a protected computer; or (2) intentionally impairing the security protection of a protected computer with the intent to defraud or injure a person or damage such computer.Prohibits any person from bringing a civil action under state law premised upon the defendant's violating this Act. Exempts any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of the United States, a state, or a local law enforcement agency or of an U.S. intelligence agency from the prohibitions of this Act.(Sec. 3) Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2011 to the Attorney General for prosecutions needed to discourage the use of spyware and practices commonly called phishing and pharming. (Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Justice should vigorously prosecute those who use spyware to commit crimes and those that conduct phishing and pharming scams."
