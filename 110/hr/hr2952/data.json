Prohibits anything in this Act from intending to authorize the Tribe to transfer, lease, encumber, or otherwise convey, any lands, or any interest in any lands, that are held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe. Bars the United States from being held liable to any party (including the Tribe or any agent or instrumentality of the Tribe) for any term of, or any loss resulting from the term of any transfer, lease, encumbrance, or conveyance of land pursuant to this Act, except as specified. Makes such prohibition nonapplicable to land transferred or conveyed by the Tribe to the United States to be held in trust for the benefit of the Tribe."
