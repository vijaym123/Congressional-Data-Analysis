    "text": "Lead-Free Drinking Water Act of 2007 - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review and revise the national primary drinking water regulation for lead to provide the maximum feasible protection for individuals affected by lead contamination, particularly vulnerable populations (e.g., infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women). Requires the revised regulation to establish: (1) a maximum contaminant level for lead in drinking water as measured at the tap; or (2) a drinking water treatment technique that meets specified criteria. Directs community water systems or nontransient noncommunity water systems to: (1) annually replace a percentage of non-lead free service lines until all such lines are replaced; (2) provide notice in English and other appropriate languages to individuals and entities that may be exposed to lead contamination in the drinking water supply; (3) provide water lead test results to tested residences; (4) establish a public education program on lead in drinking water; and (5) provide water filters to residences, schools, and day care facilities. Requires the head of each federal agency to conduct water supply testing in federally-owned or occupied buildings. Directs each water system to test drinking water for lead contamination within one year. Requires the Administrator to revise monitoring requirements under the national primary drinking water regulation to incorporate specified criteria. Prohibits the use of lead pipes and plumbing equipment that is not lead free in public water systems or facilities that provide drinking water. Requires the Administrator to: (1) issue regulations to require states to establish programs to test and remediate lead contamination in school drinking water; and (2) carry out such programs in non-participating states."
