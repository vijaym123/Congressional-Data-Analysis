Limits the amount of such credit and disqualifies taxpayers who, in any month, have employer-provided coverage, are covered under Medicare, Medicaid, or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) of the Social Security Act, or are imprisoned. Denies such credit to individuals who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents or who are dependents of a taxpayer. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program for advancing payments of credit amounts to health insurance providers of the taxpayer."
