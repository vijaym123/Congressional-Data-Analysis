Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) conduct an inventory to identify stocks of Compound 1080 under federal control; (2) provide for the collection and destruction of all remaining stocks of Compound 1080 and the compensation of persons (other than federal entities) who transfer stocks of Compound 1080 to the Secretary; and (3) disseminate information to the public about the ban on Compound 1080 and the collection and compensation program under this Act. Prohibits any federal entity from using M-44.
