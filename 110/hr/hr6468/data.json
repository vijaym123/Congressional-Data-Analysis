    "text": "Putting the Brakes on Human Smuggling Act - Disqualifies from operating a commercial motor vehicle any individual who uses a commercial motor vehicle to assist in the entry of illegal aliens into the United States. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to impose a lifetime disqualification from operating such a vehicle on any individual convicted under federal criminal law of assisting in such entry or in the harboring of illegal aliens. Revises content requirements of the commercial driver's license information system to include whether a commercial motor vehicle operator has been temporarily or permanently disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle for violation of this Act. Requires a state to notify the Secretary of Transportation or the operator of the information system of disqualifications, revocations, suspensions, or cancellations of licenses to operate a commercial motor vehicle because of such a violation."
