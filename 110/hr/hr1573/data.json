Authorizes the Secretary, for the purposes of defining the role of the National Park Service (NPS) in administering the Memorial owned by the City of Brainbridge Island to enter into agreements with the City of Bainbridge Island and specified entities. Authorizes the Secretary to operate and maintain a site in Seattle, Washington, for administrative and visitor use purposes associated with the Monument, using the facilities and other services of the Seattle unit of Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. Requires the Secretary to coordinate the development of interpretive and educational materials and programs for the Memorial and Monument site in Idaho with the Manzanar National Historic Site in California. American Falls Reservoir District Number 2 Conveyance Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey specified land to the: (1) American Falls Reservoir District No. 2 located in Jerome, Lincoln, and Gooding Counties, Idaho; (2) city of Gooding; and (3) Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
