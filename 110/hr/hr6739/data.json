    "text": "United States Climate Action Now Act - Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to revise provisions that require states to update their building energy efficiency codes. Modifies the duties of the Secretary of Energy under such Act relating to: (1) updating the national model building energy codes and standards for residential and commercial buildings; (2) reporting requirements; (3) providing technical assistance to model code-setting and standard development organizations; and (4) providing incentive funding to states for implementing updates of building energy efficiency codes. Requires states to certify to the Secretary that they have reviewed and updated the provisions of their residential and commercial building energy efficiency codes and to certify compliance with such codes. Imposes additional requirements on states that fail to meet compliance deadlines. Amends the Federal Power Act to require the President to: (1) report to Congress on barriers to constructing new transmission lines for increasing renewable electric power generation capacity; (2) designate areas as a National Renewable Energy Zone; and (3) identify, and provide public notice of, new transmission facilities that could substantially increase the generation of electricity from renewable entities. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to establish interconnection standards for state electric utilities not subject to the Federal Power Act.Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a National Bioenergy Partnership to coordinate efforts between governmental entities and the private sector to promote the deployment of sustainable biomass fuels and bioenergy technologies.Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct a study of black carbon emissions."
