Requires the eligible organization, in coordination with USAID, to manage an international surveillance program under which federal and non-federal partners: (1) monitor and test for the presence or arrival of avian pathogens and other significant pathogens in free-ranging wildlife; (2) use trained professionals to collect samples and data; (3) conduct disease surveillance, field investigations, training and capacity-building activities, and research; (4) send samples for pathogen identification and testing to certified laboratories; and (5) transmit information related to global distribution and characteristics of significant pathogens to the Administrator.Requires the Administrator, acting through the organization, to: (1) use surveillance reports and other sources to identify and investigate local outbreaks of infectious diseases involving wildlife; (2) develop a long-term baseline of regional data related to pathogens in migratory birds and other wildlife for analysis between and across sites to create a system to identify when and where outbreaks might occur and paths of dispersal; (3) provide technical assistance for disease prevention and control programs; (4) provide analytical disease findings to USAID and other federal partners; and ( 5) manage, map, and make available on an Internet database all results and information gathered under this Act. Directs the Administrator to request accredited colleges of veterinary medicine and other partners to train members of the Network to: (1) monitor important wildlife areas around the world; and (2) test for the presence or arrival of avian influenza and other significant pathogens of zoonotic concern or of concern to domestic or wild animals."
