Sets forth IRS certification requirements for PEOs, including financial review and reporting requirements. Requires a PEO to post a bond (the greater of $50,000 or 5% of the organization's tax liability for the preceding calendar year not to exceed $1,000,000) to guarantee payment of employment taxes."
