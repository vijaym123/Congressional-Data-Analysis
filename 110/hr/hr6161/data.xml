Requires the Secretary to offer to settle actions for damages resulting from failure to commence accepting such fuel or waste on or before January 31, 1998. Prohibits expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund for research and development of activities on advanced nuclear fuel cycle technologies.American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish a competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in environmentally sound exploration, development, and production of resources in the Coastal Plain, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), Alaska. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to repeal the prohibition of the production of oil and gas from ANWR. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to designate Special Areas within the Coastal Plain that may be excluded from leasing. Requires 50% of royalty revenues from leasing to be paid to Alaska. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) issue rights of way across the Coastal Plain for transportation of oil and gas; and (2) convey to the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation specified estates.Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide financial assistance from the Coastal Plain Local Government Impact Aid Assistance Fund to eligible entities impacted by the exploration for, or production of, oil and gas on the Coastal Plain.Terminates the prohibition on: (1) leasing of federal submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf for the exploration, development, or production of oil or gas; (2) issuing federal permits for such exploration, development, or production; and (3) expending federal funds on such leases or permits.Requires federal agencies which received funds for conducting climate change basic research to use such funds only for climate change applied research.</summary>
