    "text": "Green Transportation Infrastructure Research and Technology Transfer Act - (Sec. 3) Amends federal transportation law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to existing university transportation centers, or to consortia consisting of such a center and one or more institutions of higher education, to carry out green transportation infrastructure research and development and technology transfer activities. Defines \"green transportation infrastructure\" as infrastructure that: (1) preserves and restores natural processes, landforms (such as floodplains), natural vegetated stream side buffers, wetlands, or other topographical features that can slow, filter, and naturally store stormwater runoff and floodwaters for future water supply and recharge of natural aquifers; (2) uses natural design techniques to manage stormwater; and (3) minimizes lifecycle energy consumption and air pollution. Requires grant recipients to be selected on a merit-reviewed competitive basis according to specified criteria, including demonstrated expertise in transportation and green infrastructure research and technology transfer resources. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2010. (Sec. 4) Directs the National Highway Institute of the Federal Highway Administration to continually develop courses relating to the application of emerging technologies for the use of green transportation infrastructure for environmental protection and mitigating environmental impacts of transportation construction. Adds green transportation infrastructure options as a road and transportation area for which the Secretary may make local technical assistance program grants to assist rural, local transportation agencies and tribal governments to develop and expand their expertise."
