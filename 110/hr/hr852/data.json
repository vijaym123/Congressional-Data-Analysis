Provides for Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement of such provisions. Makes such provisions inapplicable to law enforcement agencies. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a telecommunication carrier to notify a customer of any incidents in which proprietary network information relating to such customer is disclosed to someone other than the customer."
