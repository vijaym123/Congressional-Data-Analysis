Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to extend authorization of appropriations for education grants for Hispanic-serving institutions. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to revise pesticide recordkeeping provisions. Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to provide for the inclusion of long-term health effects in labeling requirements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish, within the Department's Office of Civil Rights and Community Outreach of the Risk Management Agency, an office of Farmworker Coordination; (2) establish a conservation initiative for socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers; (3) provide cost-share payments and incentive payments to individual producers to address air quality concerns associated with agriculture; (4) implement an integrated pest management initiative in priority areas; and (5) establish the rural regional entrepreneurship program. Authorizes the Secretary to make emergency grants to assist low-income migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Revises the Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967.
