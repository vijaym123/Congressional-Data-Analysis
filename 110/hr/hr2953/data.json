Provides for: (1) paperwork reduction; and (2) program outreach to underserved areas. Prohibits loan or loan guarantees for new broadband service in communities with three or more service providers. Provides that for each fiscal year: (1) not more than 10% of program funds shall be available to providers with more than 10% of national subscriber lines; and (2) 40% of program funds shall be available to providers with between 2%-10% of national subscriber lines. Revises the amortization period from the life of the asset to 35 years. Requires an annual broadband program report to Congress."
