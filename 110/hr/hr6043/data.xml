  <summary>5/13/2008--Introduced.
Defines, for this Act: (1) "covered contract" as a Department of Defense (DOD) procurement contract in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom regarding which proficiency in Arabic or knowledge of Iraq is useful; and (2) "covered special immigrant visa" as a visa issued under specified provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (relating to special immigrant status for certain Iraqis) or the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (relating to special immigrant status for persons serving as translators with the U.S. Armed Forces). Authorizes the Secretary of Defense, in evaluating any bid or proposal for a covered contract, to use as an evaluation factor whether an entity intends to carry out the contract using an employee or individual subcontractor who is a recipient of a covered special immigration visa, in which case the name of each individual must be submitted to the DOD. Prohibits construing this Act as requiring the granting of security clearances in violation of a law or regulation or superseding any regulation or law intended to protect classified information or national security. Directs the Secretary: (1) on request from a contractor, to post information on a public website to enable recipients of covered special immigration visas to apply for employment with the contractor; and (2) to establish a system for notifying recipients of covered special immigration visas about the information posted on the website.</summary>
