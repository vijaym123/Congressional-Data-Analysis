(Under current law, such concurrent receipt is limited to those veterans who incur a disability in the line of duty in a combat zone or during the performance of duty in combat-related operations.) Makes such amendment effective as of January 28, 2008 (the date of enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008).</summary>
