District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority Independence Preservation Act - Amends the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to declare that the Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia does not have authority over the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority's personnel. Requires the financial management, personnel, and procurement functions and responsibilities of the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority to be: (1) established exclusively pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by its Board of Directors; and (2) consistent with the Water and Sewer Authority Establishment and Department of Public Works Reorganization Act of 1996, as in effect as of January 1, 2008. Repeals the amendment to the Water and Sewer Authority Establishment and Department of Public Works Reorganization Act of 1996 made by D.C. Act 17-172 (Jobs for D.C.
