  <summary>1/29/2007--Introduced.
Secure Border Crossing Card Entry Act of 2007 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act provide that the initial admission period for an alien with a valid machine-readable biometric border crossing identification card who has completed required background checks and who is admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant business or tourist visitor at a port of entry where such card is processed shall be not less than the initial admission period granted to any other nonimmigrant business or tourist visitor. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to prescribe the period of such initial admission as: (1) a minimum of six months; or (2) a different period determined on a case-by-case basis. Prohibits the admission or admission extension of such an alien if: (1) the alien previously violated nonimmigrant status conditions; (2) the alien is inadmissible as a nonimmigrant; or (3) the alien's border crossing card has not been processed through a machine reader at the U.S. port of entry or land border at which the person seeks U.S. admission.</summary>
