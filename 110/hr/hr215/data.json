Permits exceptions if: (1) the application of sewage sludge ended more than one year before producing food, raising poultry, producing animal feed, or grazing livestock; (2) the food labeling includes notice that is was produced on such land; or (3) a sign providing such notice is posted in close proximity to the product for those foods generally offered for sale without labeling. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify the prohibition on the use of sewage sludge in organic food production under the National Organic Program of the Department of Agriculture."
