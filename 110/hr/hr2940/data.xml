  <summary>6/28/2007--Introduced.
Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to revise the discretionary authority of the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security to temporarily admit an alien otherwise inadmissible on security- or terror-related grounds. States that: (1) any such determination or revocation shall not be subject to judicial review; and (2) any such determination shall neither prejudice the U.S. government's ability to bring a civil or criminal action against a beneficiary nor create a substantive or procedural right for the beneficiary.</summary>
