    "text": "Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Wilderness Act of 2008 - Designates certain land and potential wilderness additions in California in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks titled as \"John Krebs Wilderness\" as wilderness areas and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Provides that the designation of: (1) the land as the John Krebs Wilderness does not preclude operation and maintenance of the existing Hockett Meadow Cabin and Quinn Patrol Cabin in the same manner and degree in which such cabins were operated and maintained on the day before enactment of this Act; and (2) the potential wilderness additions shall not prohibit the operation, maintenance, and repair of the small check dams and water impoundments on Lower Franklin Lake, Crystal Lake, Upper Monarch Lake, and Eagle Lake. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to allow the use of helicopters for the operation, maintenance, and repair of such dams and water impoundments on such Lakes. Designates the potential wilderness additions as wilderness and incorporates them into the John Krebs Wilderness upon termination of the non-conforming uses. Designates certain lands in California in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks as wilderness areas and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System and which shall be considered to be a part of the Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness. Instructs the Secretary to continue to manage the maintenance and access to hydrologic, meteorologic, and climatological devices, facilities, and associated equipment consistent with House Report 98-40. Specifies this Act's effect with regard to: (1) authorized activities conducted outside outside of an area designated as wilderness by this Act by cabin owners (or designees) in the Mineral King Valley area and property owners and lessees (or designees) in the Silver City inholding; and (2) recreational and commercial horseback riding in the wilderness areas. Authorizes appropriations."
