Pay Veterans First Act - Prohibits for FY2007 the payment of a performance-based bonus to any officer of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) who is appointed by the President, by and with the consent of the Senate, or who is a senior politically appointed officer unless, at the time of the payment, fewer than 100,000 claims for veterans' disability compensation are pending before the VA. Requires the Comptroller General to conduct an audit of VA claims processing, and report audit results to Congress, for any quarter of FY2007 during which the percentage of disallowed claims exceeds by more than 10% the percentage that were disallowed during FY2006.</summary>
