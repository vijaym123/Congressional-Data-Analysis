  <summary>9/17/2008--Passed House amended.
Veteran Voting Support Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to permit a state to designate facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) located in the state as voter registration agencies under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 solely for the purposes of providing voter registration services to individuals receiving (or applying to receive) services or assistance from the facility. Requires any VA facility designated as a voter registration agency, with respect to such individuals, to: (1) provide information relating to the opportunity to request an absentee ballot; (2) make available absentee ballot applications and, upon request, assistance in completing such applications and absentee ballots; and (3) work with local election officials to ensure the proper delivery of such applications and ballots. Declares that nothing in this Act may be construed to waive any requirement under state or local law regarding an individual's eligibility to receive an absentee ballot or vote by absentee ballot in any election. Directs the Secretary to permit a meaningful opportunity for nonpartisan organizations to provide voter registration information and assistance at VA facilities. Prohibits the Secretary from banning any election administration official, whether state or local, party-affiliated or non-party affiliated, or elected or appointed, from providing nonpartisan voting information to veterans at any VA facility. Directs the Secretary to provide reasonable access to VA facilities to state and local election officials for the purpose of providing nonpartisan voter registration services to individuals.</summary>
