Requires: (1) states receiving grants under this Act to comply with standards applicable to financial contributions for emergency preparedness purposes under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; and (2) FEMA to develop a risk-based priority system for identifying deficient dams for which such grants may be made.
