Prohibits anything in this Act from affecting: (1) the development, production, conveyance, and transmission of energy; (2) state management, control, and regulation of fish and resident wildlife; and (3) access for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and private industry, to submit a report which: (1) contains a description of the energy resources available on such land and report on the amount of energy withdrawn from possible development; and (2) identifies the oil, natural gas, geothermal, wind, and solar energy that could be commercially produced, the annual available biomass for energy production, and any hydropower resources available, including tidal, dams, and in-stream flow turbines, and any impact on electricity transmission.</summary>
