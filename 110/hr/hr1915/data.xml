  <summary>4/18/2007--Introduced.
American Automobile Industry Promotion Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) offer to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences to assess state-of-the-art battery technologies with potential application for electric drive transportation; (2) conduct a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application for electric drive transportation technology (i.e., vehicles that use electric motors for all or part of the motive power); and (3) establish and carry out an Advanced Battery Initiative to support research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of battery technologies in on-road or nonroad vehicles. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to redefine the new advanced lean burn technology motor vehicle credit to suspend, until 2012 and later model vehicles, requirements that vehicles, to qualify for the credit, receive a certificate stating they meet or exceed certain weight and emission standards. Amends the Clean Air Act to: (1) define "biodiesel" and "biodiesel blend"; and (2) require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations to establish standards for each biodiesel blend.</summary>
