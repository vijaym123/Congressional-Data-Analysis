Makes the Tribe and its members eligible for all programs, benefits, and services provided by the United States to Indians and Indian tribes. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to take into trust specified real property for the benefit of the Tribe. Makes any real property taken into trust become part of the Tribe's reservation.
