Defines \"loan market value\" as the value of a multifamily (rental or cooperative housing project) loan using industry standard appraisal practices, including consideration of the cost of repairs needed for the property subject to the loan to comply with minimum safety and building standards and the cost of maintaining the affordability restrictions applicable under the original loan or grant for the property.
