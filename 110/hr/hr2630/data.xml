  <summary>7/23/2007--Passed House amended.
Campaign Expenditure Transparency Act - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit authorized committees of a candidate or any other political committee established, maintained, or controlled by a candidate or an individual holding federal office (other than a political committee of a political party) from directly or indirectly compensating the spouse of the candidate or the individual (as the case may be) for services provided to or on behalf of the committee. Requires any such committee to report on disbursements to the spouse or an immediate family member of the candidate or individual. Requires any penalty imposed for violation of this Act to be imposed on the candidate or federal office holder whose spouse receives compensation. Prohibits the committee involved from reimbursing the candidate or office holder for any such penalty.</summary>
