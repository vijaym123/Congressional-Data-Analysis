Directs the Secretary to transmit to Congress a plan for encouraging and providing incentives for the use of more efficient light bulbs by consumers and businesses. Authorizes the Secretary to provide exemptions to the prohibition only in cases where it is found, after a hearing and opportunity for public comment, that it is not technically feasible to serve a specialized lighting application, such as a military, medical, or public safety application."
