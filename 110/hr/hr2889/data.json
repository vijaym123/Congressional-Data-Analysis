Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to develop guidelines to: (1) monitor and evaluate newborn screening activities; and (2) coordinate the results of surveillance activities. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of CDC and the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, to develop a surveillance system for newborn screening. Directs the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders and Genetic Diseases in Newborns and Children to advise the Secretary on the guidelines and on monitoring and evaluating newborn screening and surveillance activities. Requires the Secretary to: (1) direct the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of HRSA to establish a central clearinghouse of current education and family support and services information, materials, resources, research, and data on newborn screening; (2) award grants for demonstration projects that increase state capacity to screen for all of the core conditions; (3) award Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening grants for demonstration projects that develop screening tests for additional newborn conditions or develop multiple markers to increase the specificity of such tests; and (4) appoint an Interagency Grant Review Panel to select grant applications and provide oversight on the grant program."
