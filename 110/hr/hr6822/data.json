Authorizes the officer or employee to seek corrective and disciplinary action with respect to such an action from the OSC and the Merit Systems Protection Board in the same manner and subject to the same terms. Excludes current appeals by GAO officers and employees from the provisions of this Act. (Thus, allows such appeals to be considered by the GAO Personnel Appeals Board.)"
