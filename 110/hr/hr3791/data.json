Requires NCMEC to forward any report of suspected child pornography violations to law enforcement agencies designated by the Attorney General. Imposes civil penalties on service providers who fail to report suspected child exploitation or pornography. Prohibits law enforcement agencies that receive reports from service providers from disclosing information in such reports except for law enforcement and criminal defense purposes.Requires service providers to preserve images of child pornography for evidentiary purposes. Grants service providers and NCMEC limited immunity from civil and criminal liability for reporting information required by this Act, except in cases of intentional misconduct or malicious failure to act in accordance with law. Requires service providers and NCMEC to minimize employee access to pornographic images and to destroy such images upon notification from a law enforcement agency.Authorizes NCMEC to provide images of child pornography reported to its CyberTipline to service providers to enable such providers to stop further transmission of pornographic images of children."
