Requires the President to report to the congressional intelligence committees on the Terrorist Surveillance Program of the National Security Agency (NSA) as well as any other program which involves electronic surveillance of U.S. persons in the United States conducted by a federal department or agency without fully complying with FISA procedures. Authorizes additional judges for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Court). Extends from 72 to 168 hours the period after initiating an emergency electronic surveillance to apply for a court order authorizing such surveillance. States that a court order is not required for the acquisition of communications between persons not located within the United States for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence information, whether the communication passes through, or the surveillance device is located within, the United States. Authorizes the hiring of additional personnel within the Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), NSA, and the Court."
