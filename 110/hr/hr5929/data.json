Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 to require a report to Congress on any legislative, regulatory, or treaty actions necessary to facilitate international cooperation in enhancement of international nuclear-material databases and the linking of those databases to enable prompt data access. Directs the Secretaries of Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security to establish a joint independent Nuclear Forensics Advisory Panel of experts not directly associated with federal laboratories to provide independent validation of any federal nuclear forensics analysis. Directs the President to report to specified congressional committees on the involvement of Cabinet-level leadership in planned nuclear terrorism preparedness exercises that include nuclear forensics analysis."
