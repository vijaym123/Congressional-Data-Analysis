Declares that such hospitals shall be treated as being located in a rural area to permit pass-through of such payments, regardless of any geographic reclassification of the hospital, including reclassification as located in an urban county ("Lugar county"). Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to include on-call and standby costs in determining reasonable costs for such services.</summary>
