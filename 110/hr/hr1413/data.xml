Requires: (1) at least two of the participating airports to be large hub airports and at least one of the airports to be a category III airport, with each of the remaining airports representing a different airport security risk category; (2) screening to be conducted under the same standards as apply to passengers at airport security screening checkpoints, to be carried out by private screeners, and, in addition, the designation of at least one lane to be used to screen individuals with unescorted access on a priority basis; (3) deployment of alternative means of screening of all individuals at one of the participating airports; (4) each participating airport operator to conduct an assessment of the screening technology used at the airport and to submit the results to the Assistant Secretary; and (5) the program to be carried out for not less than 180 days. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Assistant Secretary to report to Congress on the results of the program.</summary>
