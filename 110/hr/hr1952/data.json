Amends title XI of the Social Security Act to add a new part D (Building the National Health Information Infrastructure). Directs the Secretary to make additional Medicare payment incentives to assure that small medical care providers have the capability to move toward a national health care information infrastructure by acquiring electronic health record systems and other health information technologies. Provides for optional financial incentives to small health care providers and entities to implement such an infrastructure. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) make grants to small medical care providers for the purpose of assisting them to acquire and adopt patient registries, evidence-based clinical decision support tools at the point of care, electronic health records, secure e-mail, and other health information technologies defined by the Secretary as a key component of a national health care information infrastructure; and (2) make and guarantee loans to assist small medical care providers to acquire and adopt such things. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat qualified health care information technology as a depreciable asset for which a deduction from taxable income is allowable for the taxable year in which it is placed in service."
