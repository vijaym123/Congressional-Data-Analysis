  <summary>4/9/2008--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the U.S. government must set the highest standards to protect U.S. passport privacy and security; and (2) the Department of State must safeguard U.S. passport security. Directs the Secretary of State: (1) when establishing the requirements for physical and security components of U.S. passports and passport cards, to include only such electronic components as are currently manufactured in the United States, or can be manufactured in the United States; and (2) to ensure that all assembly of U.S. passports occurs only within U.S. borders and personalization of permanent U.S. passports occurs only under the direct supervision of U.S. government employees.</summary>
