    "text": "High-Need Physician Workforce Incentives Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to make grants to critical shortage health facilities for scholarships to individuals agreeing to serve as a physician at such facility after completing residency in the fields of family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, emergency medicine, general surgery, or obstetrics-gynecology. Excludes such scholarship funds from an individual's gross income.Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to: (1) establish a loan repayment program for individuals agreeing to serve as physicians in specified fields in areas that are not health professional shortage areas, but that have a critical shortage of physicians in such field; (2) make grants to states to provide care management fees to physicians in medically underserved communities to support the provision of targeted, accessible, continuous, coordinated, and patient-centered care through a qualified medical home; and (3) make grants to board-certified entities to establish or expand geriatric fellowship programs to train physicians practicing in rural areas or in specified fields in geriatric medicine. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from an individual's gross income compensation received by a physician from a local government for medical care performed: (1) in a medically underserved community; and (2) under a contract with the local government for a period of not less than four years."
