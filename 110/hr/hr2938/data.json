    "text": "District of Columbia Land Grant Enhancement Act of 2007 - Amends the Smith-Lever Act and the Hatch Act of 1887 to apply to the District of Columbia the reduced matching funds requirements for federal formula funds for agricultural extension work and experiment stations, respectively. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to waive such matching funds requirements when the District of Columbia is unlikely to meet them. Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to authorize funding to assist the University of the District of Columbia (UDC), a land-grant university, to construct, acquire, rent, alter, or repair buildings or facilities or relevant equipment necessary for conducting agricultural research. Makes UDC eligible for competitive grants under such Act for food and agricultural sciences education at schools having significant minority enrollments."
