Authorizes specified active or retired participants (or beneficiaries) under the contractor's pension plan to bring an action against the Department of Energy in U.S. district court for relief, in the form of a one-time lump sum payment, in connection with such a transfer of plan assets and liabilities. Authorizes commencement of such an action on or before June 30, 2011. Waives U.S. sovereign immunity to any such an action."
