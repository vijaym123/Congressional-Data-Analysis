  <summary>7/24/2008--Introduced.
Amends the USEC Privatization Act with respect to certain actions in U.S. district court related to accrued, vested pension benefits of employees of an operating contractor of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) at one or both of the two USEC gaseous diffusion plants following: (1) termination of or a change in contractor; and (2) consequent transfer of pension plan assets and liabilities. Authorizes specified active or retired participants (or beneficiaries) under the contractor's pension plan to bring an action against the Department of Energy in U.S. district court for relief, in the form of a one-time lump sum payment, in connection with such a transfer of plan assets and liabilities. Authorizes commencement of such an action on or before June 30, 2011. Waives U.S. sovereign immunity to any such an action.</summary>
