Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a business tax credit for breast pumps and other equipment to assist employed mothers to breastfeed or express milk for their children and for consultation services relating to breastfeeding. Safe and Effective Breast Pumps Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) put into effect a performance standard for breast pumps irrespective of the class to which the breast pumps have been classified under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and (2) issue a compliance policy guide which will assure that women who want to breastfeed a child are given full and complete information respecting breast pumps. Expands the definition of medical care in the Internal Revenue Code for purposes of the tax deduction for medical expenses to include qualified breastfeeding equipment and services."
