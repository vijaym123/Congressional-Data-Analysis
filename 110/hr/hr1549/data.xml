  <summary>3/15/2007--Introduced.
College and University Hurricane Revitalization Act of 2007 - Provides for calculating the allotments of grants under title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which provides institutional aid to schools serving high percentages of minority and low-income students, to institutions of higher education located in parishes or counties for which a major disaster was declared owing to Hurricane Katrina or Rita. Requires the Secretary of Education to consider school data from the school year immediately preceding the school year which included August, 29, 2005, rather than current school year data, in calculating 2007-2012 grant allotments. Requires each institution to submit a written request to the Secretary for such consideration.</summary>
