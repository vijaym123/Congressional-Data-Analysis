    "text": "Small Energy Efficient Businesses Act - Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to: (1) authorize financial assistance through the Small Business Administration (SBA) to state and local development companies for projects that reduce energy consumption by at least 10%, reduce the use of non-renewable energy sources, or generate renewable energy sources; and (2) provide loan limits for such projects. Amends the Small Business Act to direct the SBA Administrator to make small business loans to purchase energy efficient equipment or fixtures, or to reduce the borrower's energy consumption. Authorizes a small business development center to carry out a small business sustainability initiative (support to small businesses to evaluate their energy efficiency and achieve increased efficiency). Directs the Administrator to develop and coordinate a program to provide small business education on energy efficiency. Authorizes small business investment companies to issue Energy Saving debentures. Requires the Administrator to establish a Renewable Fuel Capital Investment Program under which the Administrator may: (1) enter into participation agreements with renewable fuel capital investment companies to promote the research, development, manufacture, and marketing of renewable energy sources; and (2) guarantee debentures issued by such companies."
