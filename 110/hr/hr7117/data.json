Establishes the National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Fund to carry out projects under this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on taxable ground transportation of property equal to 1% of the fair market value of such transportation. Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to charge and collect a freight mobility customs fee. Requires deposit into the Fund of amounts equivalent to: (1) the tax imposed on taxable ground transportation of property; and (2) freight mobility customs fees."
