Veterans' Employment Transition Support Act of 2007 or the VETS Act of 2007 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a general business tax credit for hiring certain veterans certified by designated local agencies as having served on active duty (other than for training) in the Armed Forces for a period of more than 180 days or having been discharged or released from active duty for a service-connected disability. Sets the amount of such credit at 40% of the first-year wages of such veterans and increases the percentage of such credit for disabled veterans based upon their disability ratings.</summary>
