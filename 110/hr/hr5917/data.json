    "text": "New Bridging Industry and Government Through Hi-Tech Research on Energy Efficiency Act of 2008 - Requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a program for making grants to National Laboratories and institutions of higher education for research, development, and demonstration of high-efficiency advanced battery technologies. Allows such grants to be used for: (1) exploratory research; (2) battery system development; (3) vehicle technology demonstration and validation; and (4) U.S. advanced battery production capability development.Defines \"battery\" to mean an electrochemical energy storage system powered directly by electrical current.Requires the Secretary to give priority consideration to National Laboratories and institutions of higher education that partner with original equipment manufacturers of vehicles that will use the technologies.Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend and revise the credit for increasing research activities. Establishes an Interagency Working Group on Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards to ensure that federal agencies' work to research and develop advanced fuel technology is coordinated and concerted in order to increase vehicle fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to work with national and international standard setting organizations to harmonize standards for the production of biofuels from a variety of feedstocks and the blending of such fuels with petroleum-based fuels at various concentrations.Requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a program for making grants with the goal of establishing at least 100 publicly available hydrogen fueling pumps at retail gas stations by 2013 in at least two selected regions.Authorizes funds to be appropriated to the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) for the acquisition of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for use by federal agencies for each of FY2012-FY2014."
