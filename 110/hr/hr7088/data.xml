  <summary>9/25/2008--Introduced.
Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to establish an emergency management performance grants program to address domestic preparedness and collective response to a catastrophic incident. Limits the federal share of the cost of a program funded activity to 50%. Sets forth guidelines for the Administrator to apportion funds to carry out the program among the states on the basis of population. Revises the program providing grants to states for emergency operations centers to provide that such centers are to be equipped, upgraded, and constructed for domestic preparedness and collective response to a catastrophic incident.</summary>
