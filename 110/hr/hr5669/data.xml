  <summary>6/4/2008--Passed House without amendment.
Poison Center Support, Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide coordination and assistance for the maintenance of the nationwide toll-free phone number to access poison centers. Changes the name of poison control centers to poison centers.Requires the Secretary to carry out and expand upon a national media campaign to educate the public and health care providers about poison prevention and the availability of poison center resources in local communities. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with a nationally recognized organization for the development and implementation of a nationwide poison prevention and poison center awareness campaign.Expands the poison center grant program to allow the Secretary to award grants for poison centers to comply with the operational requirements needed to sustain certification. Adds as the purposes for which such grants may be used: (1) to establish and evaluate best practices in the United States for poison prevention, poison center outreach, and emergency and preparedness programs; (2) to develop and implement standard patient management guidelines for commonly encountered toxic exposures; (3) to improve national toxic exposure surveillance; (4) to develop, support, and enhance technology and capabilities of professional organizations in the field of poison control to collect national poisoning, toxic occurrence, and related public health data; and (5) to develop initiatives to foster the enhanced public health utilization of national poison data. Eliminates matching requirements for such grants. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2014.</summary>
