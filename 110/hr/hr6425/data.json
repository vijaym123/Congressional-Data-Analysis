Requires the Corps to consist of individuals who do not ordinarily have the duties of a full-time DHS officer or employee. Directs the Secretary to ensure that: (1) each Corps member receives core training in functions relating to emergency response or post-incident recovery and rebuilding efforts, or both; and (2) at least 30% of Corps members assigned to carry out a project reside, or resided prior to an act of terrorism, natural disaster, or other emergency, in the region in which the project is conducted. Requires the Secretary to: (1) identify response and recovery projects that warrant support from the Corps; (2) direct and oversee Corps activities; (3) govern the selection of Corps members; and (4) formulate and administer a system of uniform periodic reports on the number of individuals employed by, and the number of individuals and households receiving relief from, the Corps. Authorizes the Secretary to appoint a Corps member into federal service for the purpose of participation in Corps activities without regard to provisions governing appointments in the competitive service. Directs the Secretary to develop a plan for directing the Corps to assist in recovery and rebuilding efforts for the Gulf Coast region in the wake of Hurricane Katrina."
