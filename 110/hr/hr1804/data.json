Authorizes a Katrina-affected hospital, if it seeks treatment as a rehabilitation unit of any such unit that is to be reopened, to provide a written certification that the inpatient population the hospital intends the unit to serve meets certain requirements, instead of showing that the unit has treated such a population during the hospital's most recent cost reporting period in the same manner as a hospital that seeks exclusion of a new rehabilitation unit may provide such a certification."
