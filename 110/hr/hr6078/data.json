    "text": "Green Resources for Energy Efficient Neighborhoods Act of 2008 or the GREEN Act of 2008 - Sets forth provisions concerning Housing of Urban Development (HUD) energy efficiency and conservation standards and green building standards for structures (conservation standards).Requires the Secretary of HUD to conduct a program to demonstrate the effectiveness of funding a portion of the costs of carrying out energy efficiency and conservation and green building measures for multifamily housing projects for which rental assistance is provided under a covered multifamily assistance program. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to provide for credits for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for mortgage purchases that support housing that meets conservation standards.Amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to include provisions concerning energy-efficient mortgages and location-efficient mortgages.Amends the National Housing Act to require the Secretary to: (1) ensure that the aggregate outstanding principal obligation of mortgages on single-family housing meeting energy efficiency standards that are insured by the Secretary is not less than $1 billion; and (2) conduct an energy efficient mortgages education and outreach campaign. Amends the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 to require the disclosure of the number and dollar amount of mortgage loans that are energy efficient and location efficient. Prohibits insurers from denying homeowner insurance coverage or discriminating in coverage for structures that are not connected to, or not able to receive electricity from, electric power providers.
