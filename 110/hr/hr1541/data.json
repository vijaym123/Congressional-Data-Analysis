Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a pilot program of family-to-family support for families of such members; and (2) contract for support services for children, infants, and toddlers of such members. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to jointly expand and enhance access to mental health services for families of members who are disabled during military service.
