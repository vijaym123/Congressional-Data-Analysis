  <summary>9/16/2008--Introduced.
Amends the Wilderness Act to grant members of recreation organizations the right to cross wilderness areas on established trails without restriction as part of a journey along a connecting system of trails across public, private, or wilderness area lands, provided such right is exercised within a day and continued without unreasonable delay. Defines a "recreation organization." Authorizes agencies administering wilderness areas to limit the exercise of such right within any specific area to not more than 10 wilderness crossings annually.</summary>
