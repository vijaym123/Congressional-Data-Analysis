Protect Consumers Act of 2007 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon a determination that it is necessary to implement a mandatory recall of any product regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to issue an order requiring the appropriate person to: (1) immediately cease distribution, manufacture, and sale of such product; (2) immediately provide notice to individuals subject to the risks associated with the use of such product; and (3) implement an immediate recall of such product. Directs that the order shall provide for an informal hearing within ten days. Treats the failure to obey such an order as a prohibited act under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
