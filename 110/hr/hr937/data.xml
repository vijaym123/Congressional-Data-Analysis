  <summary>2/8/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the United Nations should: (1) ensure that the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) enforces its rules regarding financing, staffing, accounting, and auditing of its activities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea); (2) authorize an external investigation of all UNDP activities in North Korea; and (3) ensure that any UNDP local staff in North Korea who committed crimes are prosecuted or who violated regulations are sanctioned. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should use U.S. influence to ensure that UNDP: (1) ceases activities in North Korea that are in violation of UNDP regulations; (2) conducts a full audit of UNDP activities in North Korea since 1998; and (3) establishes regulations to ensure that no funds allocated to UNDP activities in North Korea are provided to the government of North Korea. Directs the Secretary of State to withhold U.S. contributions to the general funds of UNDP until the Secretary certifies to Congress that UNDP meets such provisions.</summary>
