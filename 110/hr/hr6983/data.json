Requires determinations as to increases in actual costs under a plan to be made and certified by a qualified and licensed actuary. Requires determinations for such an exemption to be made after such plan has complied with this Act for the first six months of the plan year.Sets forth requirements for notifications of exemptions under this Act, including notification of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the appropriate state agencies, and participants and beneficiaries in the plan.Authorizes the Secretary and the appropriate state agency to audit the books and records of a group health plan relating to an exemption.Directs the Secretary to: (1) report to the appropriate congressional committees on compliance of group health plans with the requirements of this Act; and (2) publish guidance and information concerning the requirements of this Act and provide assistance concerning such requirements and the continued operation of applicable state law. Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the specific rates, patterns, and trends in coverage and exclusion of specific mental health and substance use disorder diagnoses by health plans and health insurance.(Sec. 3) - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) delay until 2013 the application of special rules for the worldwide allocation of interest for purposes of computing the limitation on the foreign tax credit; and (2) increase the amount of interest allocable to sources within the United States from 30 to 85% in the first taxable year in which the worldwide allocation of interest applies."
