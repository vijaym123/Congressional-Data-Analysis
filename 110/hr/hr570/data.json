Directs the Secretary of Energy, acting through the Clean Cities Program of the Department of Energy, to establish a program of grants to expand the availability of alternative fuels to consumers. Makes amounts in the Fund available to the Secretary for such grants. Declares eligible for assistance any entity that is eligible for assistance under the Clean Cities Program. Bars from such assistance: (1) large, vertically-integrated oil companies; and (2) any entity that receives other federal funds for the construction or expansion of the same alternative refueling infrastructure. Sets forth a maximum ceiling for grants and for stations. Limits the use of such funds to construction or expansion of alternative fueling infrastructure."
