  <summary>6/26/2008--Introduced.
Provides that no automatic pay adjustment shall be considered to have taken effect in FY2009 in the rates of basic pay for Members of Congress under the statutory pay system (thus eliminating the pay adjustment for Members for such fiscal year). Expresses the sense of Congress that any savings resulting from the enactment of this Act should be dedicated to reducing the federal budget deficit.</summary>
