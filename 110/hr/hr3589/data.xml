Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to allow the filing of a petition with the Secretary of Labor for certification of eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance (TAA) by adversely affected workers in a service sector firm or subdivision. Defines "service sector firm" as an entity engaged in the business of providing information technology or other high technology services. Revises group eligibility requirements for TAA to cover: (1) a shift, by such workers' firm or subdivision to a foreign country, in provision of services, like or directly competitive with services which are provided by such firm or subdivision; and (2) instances where such workers' firm or subdivision obtains or is likely to obtain such services from a foreign country. Provides for the certification for TAA of adversely affected secondary workers in a service sector firm or subdivision.</summary>
