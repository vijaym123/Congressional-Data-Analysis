Defines \"service sector firm\" as an entity engaged in the business of providing information technology or other high technology services. Revises group eligibility requirements for TAA to cover: (1) a shift, by such workers' firm or subdivision to a foreign country, in provision of services, like or directly competitive with services which are provided by such firm or subdivision; and (2) instances where such workers' firm or subdivision obtains or is likely to obtain such services from a foreign country. Provides for the certification for TAA of adversely affected secondary workers in a service sector firm or subdivision."
