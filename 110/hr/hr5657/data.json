Declares that nothing in such limitation shall be construed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as prohibiting a state's use of funds as the nonfederal share of Medicaid expenditures where they are transferred from or certified by a publicly-owned regional medical center located in another state, so long as the Secretary determines that such use is proper and in the interest of the Medicaid program."
