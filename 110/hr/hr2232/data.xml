  <summary>5/9/2007--Introduced.
Clarification of Federal Employment Protections Act - Repudiates, in order to dispel any public confusion, any assertion that federal employees are not protected from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Prohibits any federal employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, from discriminating for or against any federal employee or applicant for federal employment on the basis of sexual orientation. Affirms that, in the absence of such prohibition, discrimination against federal employees and applicants for federal employment on the basis of sexual orientation is already prohibited under current law.</summary>
