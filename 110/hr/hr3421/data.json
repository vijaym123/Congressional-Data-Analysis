Requires conspicuous payment disclosures on a creditor's billing cycle statement, including: (1) the minimum monthly payment on the outstanding balance; (2) the number of months that it would take to pay the entire amount of the outstanding balance at the current APR if only the required minimum monthly payment is paid; and (3) the total cost to the consumer to pay the remaining balance."
