  <summary>4/2/2008--Introduced.
Neighborhood Rescue and Stabilization Act of 2008 - Authorizes for FY2008 appropriations for assistance to states and local governmental units for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes. Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to allocate the funds among the states according to a funding formula reflecting the ratio that home mortgage foreclosures occurring in a state bears to the aggregate number of such foreclosures occurring in all states. Requires states to allocate funds to qualified metropolitan cities according to a similar formula. Requires states and local governmental units to give priority to those metropolitan areas, metropolitan cities, urban areas, rural areas, low- and moderate-income areas, and other areas with the greatest need, including those: (1) with the greatest percentage of home foreclosures; (2) with the highest percentage of homes financed by a subprime mortgage related loan; or (3) identified as likely to face a significant rise in the rate of home foreclosures. Cites eligible uses and redevelopment financing mechanisms. Sets forth low- and moderate-income requirements for the use of all funds made available under this Act.</summary>
