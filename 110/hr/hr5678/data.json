Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to allocate the funds among the states according to a funding formula reflecting the ratio that home mortgage foreclosures occurring in a state bears to the aggregate number of such foreclosures occurring in all states. Requires states to allocate funds to qualified metropolitan cities according to a similar formula. Requires states and local governmental units to give priority to those metropolitan areas, metropolitan cities, urban areas, rural areas, low- and moderate-income areas, and other areas with the greatest need, including those: (1) with the greatest percentage of home foreclosures; (2) with the highest percentage of homes financed by a subprime mortgage related loan; or (3) identified as likely to face a significant rise in the rate of home foreclosures. Cites eligible uses and redevelopment financing mechanisms. Sets forth low- and moderate-income requirements for the use of all funds made available under this Act."
