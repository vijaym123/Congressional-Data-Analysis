Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) long-term U.S.-Iraq relations should be determined by the U.S. Administration taking office on January 20, 2009; (2) in determining its policy toward Iraq such Administration should consult with Congress, the government of Iraq, Coalition partners, and Iraq's neighbors; and (3) to maintain international legal authority as well as immunity from Iraqi prosecution for U.S. Armed Forces and other Coalition forces operating in Iraq while such Administration determines policy toward Iraq the current U.S. Administration should encourage the government of Iraq to request renewal of the U.N. mandate for Iraq beyond December 31, 2008."
