Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to states and U.S. territories for specified state and local activities, including mandatory establishment or designation of an Office of Coordinator for Education of Homeless Children and Youths in each state educational agency (SEA). Prohibits segregation of such children and youths into separate schools or programs within schools. Requires each SEA to make subgrants to LEAs to facilitate the identification, enrollment, attendance, and success in school of homeless children and youths. Directs the Secretary to make grants to states for transportation for school stability, readiness, and success for such children and youths."
