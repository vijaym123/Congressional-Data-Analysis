  <summary>5/3/2007--Introduced.
Declares that the results of an AMP study (an area mail processing study relating to consolidating the operations of two or more postal facilities) shall not be cognizable for any purpose unless specified time limit and notice requirements are met. Requires the U.S. Postal Service to ensure that no reduction in the workforce of, and no removal of equipment from, any postal facility occurs while an AMP study regarding that facility is pending. Applies this Act to AMP studies started on or after enactment and to studies pending at enactment of this Act.</summary>
