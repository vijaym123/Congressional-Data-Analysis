Sets forth requirements for issues of school construction bonds, including that: (1) 95% of the proceeds of such bonds must be used to construct new elementary and secondary school facilities and provide equipment for such schools; (2) local education agencies must require private business contributions of not less than 10% of the proceeds of an issue; and (3) bonds must be used for schools which meet specified criteria relating to curriculum, the alleviation of classroom overcrowding, and student-teacher ratios. Provides for a national school construction bond limitation of $400 million in 2008 and 2009."
