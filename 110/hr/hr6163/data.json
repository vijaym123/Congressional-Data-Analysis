Directs the Secretary to include as a home health visit for Medicare purposes telehealth services furnished an individual by a home health agency. Provides for coverage of remote patient management services, including home health remote patient management services, for certain chronic health conditions. Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration project to evaluate the impact and benefits of covering remote patient management services for certain chronic health conditions. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (of the Health Resources and Services Administration), to make grants to expand access via telehealth to health care services for individuals in medically underserved rural, frontier, and urban areas. Amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize telehealth network and telehealth resource centers grant programs."
