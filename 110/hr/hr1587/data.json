Establishes the Interagency Committee on Levee Safety to support federal levee safety programs through coordination and information exchange among federal agencies concerning the implementation of levee safety guidelines. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish the National Levee Safety Review Board to monitor levee safety and state implementation of this Act and to advise the Secretary on national levee safety policy; (2) establish a national levee safety program, including federal levee safety guidelines; (3) provide assistance for and periodically review state levee safety programs; (4) carry out a program of technical and archival research regarding levee construction, rehabilitation, inspection, safety, security, and management; and (5) establish a program to train state safety agency staff and inspectors."
