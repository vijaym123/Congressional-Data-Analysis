  <summary>12/17/2007--Introduced.
Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to repeal the limitiation on actual charges to a beneficiary under Medicare for services by a nonparticipating physician or nonparticipating supplier or other person who does not accept payment on an assignment-related basis for a physician's service. Prohibits a state from imposing a limit on the amount of charges, in relation to recognized payment amounts under any health plan or otherwise, a physician may impose for services furnished. Preempts any such limit.</summary>
