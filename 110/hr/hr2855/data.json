Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a business tax credit for employers hiring Wounded Heroes. Amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to provide increased protections under such Act for Wounded Heroes and persons in military service. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) to ensure the provision of sufficient services to meet the needs of Wounded Heroes without regard to residential geographic location with respect to the following: (1) adult day health care; (2) home health care; (3) respite care; (4) home-based primary care; (5) hospice; and (6) such other noninstitutional extended care services as appropriate. Directs the Secretary to operate and maintain a program in caregiver education, training, and certification for family members of Wounded Heroes. Authorizes the Secretary to contract with non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities to furnish care to a Wounded Hero, under certain conditions. Establishes: (1) in the VA an Office for Wounded Heroes Advocate; (2) in the Executive Office of the President an Office for Wounded Heroes; and (3) the Wounded Heroes Independent Review Board. Requires the Board to, among other things, review VA or other federal agency determinations with respect to the scope and intensity of benefits, especially health care or vocational rehabilitation, provided to Wounded Heroes."
