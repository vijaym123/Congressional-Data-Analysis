Treats as secondary school graduates any disabled students who: (1) graduate with a regular diploma before their 22nd birthday; or (2) turn 22 without obtaining a regular diploma, but have achieved the goals of their individualized education programs. Raises from three to five years the number of years LEP students may be in this country before having their English language proficiency assessed."
