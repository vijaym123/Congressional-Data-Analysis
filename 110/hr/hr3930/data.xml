Requires that such land exchange include the conveyance of all surface, subsurface, mineral, and water rights to the federal and state land. Provides that the exchange of the federal and state land shall not require an amendment to the Mimbres Resource Management Plan. Establishes the Preservation Area for the protection, conservation, and enhancement of habitat for the lesser prairie chicken. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to only allow uses of the Preservation Area that will further the purposes for which it is established. Permits the use of motorized vehicles or mechanized transport in the Preservation Area, only on roads and trails designated for vehicular use under the management plan, except as needed for administrative purposes or to respond to an emergency. Withdraws all Bureau of Land Management (BLM) managed land within the Preservation Area and any land and interests in land acquired by the United States for the Preservation Area from: (1) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) disposal under the mineral leasing, mineral materials, and geothermal leasing laws. Allows hunting and trapping in the Preservation Area to the extent consistent with the protection and conservation of the lesser prairie chicken. Authorizes the Secretary to designate by regulation areas in which, and establish periods during which, for reasons of public safety, administration, or compliance with applicable laws, no hunting or trapping will be permitted. Instructs the Secretary, except in emergencies, to consult with the appropriate state agency before promulgating regulations that close a portion of the Preservation Area to hunting and trapping. Authorizes the Secretary to allow grazing only for the purpose of vegetative management to enhance lesser prairie chicken habitat. Declares that the fact that an activity or use of land is not permitted on land within the Preservation Area shall not preclude the activity or use outside the boundary of the Preservation Area or on private land within it, consistent with other applicable law. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire land in the Preservation Area only from a willing seller or through purchase, exchange, or donation. Authorizes the Secretary to establish sites in the Preservation Area to permit the interpretation of the Preservation Area's historical, cultural, scientific, archeological, natural, and educational resources.
