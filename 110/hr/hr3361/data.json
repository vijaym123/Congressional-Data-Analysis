Requires the administrator of a combined pension plan (consisting of a defined benefit plan and a qualified cash or deferred arrangement) to treat such plans separately upon termination.(Sec. 11) Provides that former spouses shall be entitled to survivor benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act if: (1) the employee completed 10 years of service in the railroad industry (or five years of service after December 31, 1995); (2) the spouse or former spouse has attained age 62; and (3) the employee attains age 62 (or if deceased, would have attained age 62).
