Requires each grantee to identify a minimum of five local educational agencies (LEAs) to participate in its pilot program and limit student participation to 0.5% of the students assessed in each participating LEA. Requires such states and LEAs to ensure that each participating student's individualized education program team: (1) administers, after securing parental consent, a scientifically-valid and reliable assessment based on the student's instructional level in reading and/or math; and (2) based on such assessment, develops a series of targeted interventions designed to close identified gaps in the student's instructional and grade-level content knowledge. Prohibits the use of such assessment results in determinations of adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward state academic performance standards."
