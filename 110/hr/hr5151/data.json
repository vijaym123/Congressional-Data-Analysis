    "text": "Wild Monongahela Act: A National Legacy for West Virginia's Special Places - Designates specified federal lands in the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia, as wilderness and as either a new component, or as an addition to an existing component, of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Allows the Secretary of Agriculture to continue to authorize the competitive running event permitted from 2003 through 2007 in the vicinity of the boundaries of the Dolly Sods Wilderness addition and the Roaring Plains West Wilderness Area in a manner compatible with the preservation of such areas as wilderness. Prohibits anything in this Act from affecting the jurisdiction or responsibility of the state of West Virginia respecting wildlife and fish.Modifies the boundary of the Laurel Fork South Wilderness designated by P.L. 97- 466 (relating to the designation of certain lands in the Monongahela National Forest as wilderness) to exclude two specified parcels of land. States that the boundary of the Monongahela National Forest is confirmed to include specified tracts of land. Provides that, for the purposes relating to the allocation of moneys from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for the acquisition of land, waters, or interests in land or waters in the National Park System, the National Forest System, or the National Wildlife Refuge System, the boundaries of the Monongahela National Forest, as confirmed by this Act, shall be considered to be the boundaries of the Forest as of January 1, 1965. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop a plan to provide for enhanced nonmotorized recreation trail opportunities on lands not designated as wilderness within the Monongahela National Forest; and (2) submit to Congress a report on the implementation of the plan, including the identification of priority trails for development. Provides for the consideration of conversion of forest roads within Monongahela National Forest to nonmotorized uses to enhance recreational opportunities within the Forest."
