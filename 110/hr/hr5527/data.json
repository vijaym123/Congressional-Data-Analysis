Requires consumer confidence reports to disclose the presence of, and the potential health and cancer risks to susceptible populations from exposure to, trichloroethylene in drinking water.Requires the Administrator to: (1) publish a health advisory (including cancer risks) for trichloroethylene that fully protects the health of susceptible populations from vapor intrusion; (2) establish an integrated risk information system reference concentration of trichloroethylene vapor that is protective of susceptible populations; and (3) apply such reference concentration with respect to any potential vapor intrusion-related investigations or actions to protect public health with respect to trichloroethylene exposure carried out pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 and the Safe Drinking Water Act."
