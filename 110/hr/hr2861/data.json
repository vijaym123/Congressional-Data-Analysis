Directs the Commissioner of the National Center for Educational Statistics to study and report to Congress on the performance of recipients of grants for the language instruction of limited English proficient and immigrant students under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to measure student academic progress. Directs the Secretary of Education to compile and publicize a list of state instructional programs for such students that assesses the costs and benefits of each program. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants under the Pell Grant program to institutions of higher education to provide: (1) foreign language and teacher preparation instruction to incoming first-year undergraduates during the months preceding their enrollment; and (2) scholarships to such students for the costs of such instruction."
