  <summary>9/29/2008--Passed House without amendment.
Requires Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations governing determinations of ineligibility for appointment to a position in an executive agency because of deliberate failure to register with the selective service to provide an exception for the appointment of an individual who was discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honorable conditions.Requires the Director of the Selective Service System to prescribe procedures: (1) for the adjudication of determinations of whether a failure to register was knowing and willful; and (2) under which such a determination may not be made if the individual concerned shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the failure to register was neither knowing nor willful. Allows any individual whose case was adjudicated under the earlier regulations from February 21, 2007, through the effective date of regulations prescribed under this Act to have his or her case readjudicated.</summary>
