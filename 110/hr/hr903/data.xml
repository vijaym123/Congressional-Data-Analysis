Colorado Northern Front Range Mountain Backdrop Protection Study Act - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, to conduct a study of the land within the study area (certain lands in southern Boulder, northern Jefferson, and northern Gilpin Counties, Colorado) and complete a report: (1) identifying the present ownership of the land within the study area; (2) identifying any undeveloped land that may be at risk of development; and (3) describing any actions that could be taken to preserve the open and undeveloped character of the land within the study area. Requires the Secretary to conduct the study and develop the report with the support and participation of one or more specified state and local entities. Allows the Secretary if such state and local entities do not support and participate in the study and report to: (1) decrease the area covered by the study area, as appropriate; or (2) opt not to conduct the study or develop the report and notify specified congressional committees of such decision. Prohibits anything in this Act from authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to take any action that would affect the use of any land not owned by the United States.</summary>
