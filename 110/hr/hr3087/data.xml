  <summary>10/2/2007--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) nothing in this Act shall be construed as a recommendation by Congress that any particular contingency plan be exercised; (2) it is necessary and prudent for the Department of Defense (DOD) to undertake robust and comprehensive contingency planning; (3) contingency planning for a redeployment of Armed Forces from Iraq should address appropriate protection for U.S. Armed Forces, civilians, contractors, and third party and Iraqi nationals who have aided the U.S. mission in Iraq, and the preservation of military equipment; and (4) such planning should describe a range of scenarios and timetables for redeployment, and describe possible missions of Armed Forces remaining in Iraq. Directs the Secretary of Defense, within 60 days after the enactment of this Act and every 90 days thereafter, to report to the congressional defense and appropriations committees on the status of planning for the redeployment of Armed Forces from Iraq. Requires the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to brief such committees on matters contained in the reports. Terminates the reporting and briefing requirements on the date on which the Secretary certifies to such committees that the Armed Forces are no longer primarily engaged in a combat mission in Iraq.</summary>
