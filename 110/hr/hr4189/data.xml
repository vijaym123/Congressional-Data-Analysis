  <summary>11/14/2007--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Energy to contract with the operator of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Facility for the transfer from the Department of Energy's enrichment facility at Piketon, Ohio, to the Paducah facility of cylinders of uranium tailings with an assay of such value as the Secretary finds economically suitable for re-enrichment. Requires such contract to provide for re-enrichment at the Paducah facility of the materials in the cylinders and in similar cylinders of comparable value. Requires the Secretary to sell or contract for the sale of the product of such re-enrichment, whose net proceeds shall be deposited into the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund (UEDD Fund) and disbursed by appropriation for environmental remediation at the Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, uranium enrichment facilities. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to reauthorize the UEDD Fund for an additional three years.</summary>
