    "text": "Title I: Renewable Fuel Infrastructure - (Sec. 101) Instructs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) establish an infrastructure development grants program to assist motor fuel dealers to implement motor fuel storage and dispensing infrastructure for renewable fuel; (2) enter into contracts with entities to install and market renewable fuels; and (3) establish requirements for grant recipients to provide renewable fuel to the public. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2014. Prohibits grants to a large, vertically integrated oil company.(Sec. 102) Amends the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act to prohibit franchise agreement restrictions regarding installation of renewable fuel infrastructures. (Sec. 103) Instructs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on: (1) the market penetration for flexible-fuel vehicles: (2) the feasibility of requiring motor fuel retailers to install E-85 compatible dispensers at retail fuel facilities; (3) the feasibility of dedicated ethanol pipeline construction; and (4) the adequacy of railroad transportation of domestically-produced renewable fuel. (Sec. 105) Instructs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study and report to Congress on domestic utilization of ethanol blended gasoline with levels of ethanol greater than 10%. (Sec. 107) Amends the Clean Air Act to: (1) direct the EPA Administrator to initiate a rulemaking to establish a series of uniform per gallon fuel standards for categories of fuels containing biodiesel; and (2) authorize appropriations for grants for FY2009-FY2010 for cellulosic ethanol production assistance. (Sec. 109) Instructs the Secretary of Transportation to launch a consumer education campaign about flexible-fuel vehicles. (Sec. 110) Declares that any waiver under the Clean Air Act for any renewable fuel or renewable fuel additive shall not be considered granted unless the EPA Administrator, following a public notice and comment period, takes final action granting the waiver based on an application of specified emissions control devices or systems standards and criteria, as well as vehicle emissions standards, to on-road and non-road engines and vehicles. (Sec. 111) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to instruct the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to encourage domestic production and sales of flexible fuel vehicles.Requires priority to be given to refurbishment or retooling of manufacturing facilities that have recently ceased operation or will cease operation in the near future. Authorizes such Secretary to coordinate program implementation with similar state and local programs, including retention and retraining of skilled workers from such manufacturing facilities. (Sec.112) Authorizes appropriations for FY2008 for research on cellulosic ethanol and biofuels. (Sec. 113) Requires installation of at least one renewable fuel pump at each federal fleet fueling center by January 1, 2010. (Sec. 114) Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) study and report to Congress on the impact of increased renewable fuel use on the domestic economy; (2) provide grants for renewable fuel production research and development; and (3) study and report to Congress on the anticipated effects on renewable fuels production if oil were priced no lower than $40 per barrel. (Sec. 117) Amends federal transportation law to include B20 biodiesel blend as an alternative fuel for Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) purposes. Title II: United States-Israel Energy Cooperation - United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act - (Sec. 203) Establishes a grant program for a joint venture of Israeli and U.S. business and academic entities to research, develop, or commercialize alternative energy, improved energy efficiency, or renewable energy sources. (Sec. 204) Establishes an International Energy Advisory Board to advise the Secretary on such efforts. (Sec. 207) Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2014."
