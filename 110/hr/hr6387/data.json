    "text": "Afghanistan-Pakistan Security and Prosperity Enhancement Act - Authorizes the President to designate Reconstruction Opportunity Zones within Afghanistan or Pakistan, provided certain eligibility criteria are met, including that: (1) such countries establish, or make progress toward establishing, a market-based economy, instituting rule of law, protecting core labor standards, and eliminating barriers to trade and investment; (2) such countries can be designated as a beneficiary developing country; and (3) the designation of a Reconstruction Opportunity Zone is appropriate taking into account certain qualifying factors. Provides for the duty-free treatment of certain textile and apparel products, as well as nontextile and nonapparel products, from a Reconstruction Opportunity Zone through September 30, 2023. Sets forth requirements to prevent the unlawful transshipment of such products. Continues the duty-free treatment of such products from a Reconstruction Opportunity Zone in Afghanistan or Pakistan only if the President certifies to Congress that such countries have met certain requirements, including: (1) designation of a labor official; and (2) have agreed to require textile or apparel exporting enterprises to participate in a technical assistance, capacity building, compliance assessment, and remediation program. Authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under this Act."
