    "text": "Community College Partnership Act of 2007 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a Community College Opportunity program to help students at community or technical colleges transfer to four-year institutions and complete bachelor's degrees. Directs the Secretary of Education to award program grants to eligible partnerships that include one or more community or technical colleges that award associate's degrees and one or more institutions of higher education (IHEs) that offer a baccalaureate or postbaccalaureate degree not awarded by the partner colleges. Authorizes the inclusion of a state agency overseeing or coordinating IHEs. Requires such grants to be used for: (1) the development of policies and programs that expand opportunities for community or technical college students to earn bachelor's degrees, including those that promote the transfer of academic credits between institutions and expand articulation and guaranteed transfer agreements between IHEs; (2) support services to students participating in the program, including tutoring, mentoring, academic and personal counseling, and transition facilitation; (3) academic program enhancements at the community or technical college that increase program quality and the number of student participants in the program offered in cooperation with a baccalaureate degree-granting institution; and (4) programs to identify barriers that inhibit student transfers."
