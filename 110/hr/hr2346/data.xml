  <summary>5/16/2007--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a process for determining whether a geographic area is sufficiently served by the national cemeteries located in that area, taking into account, among other things: (1) the number of veterans living in the area; and (2) the average distance a resident of the area must travel to reach the nearest national cemetery. Requires the Secretary, in case of an area with insufficient land to establish a cemetery, to consider alternatives such as establishing a mausoleum.</summary>
