Shirley A. Chisholm United States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act of 2008 - (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary of State to establish the Shirley A. Chisholm United States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Program under which scholars and secondary, undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students from Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries (excluding countries with observer status or that support international terrorism) would attend U.S. schools or universities, participate in activities designed to promote a greater understanding of U.S. values and culture. Sets forth program elements. Directs the Secretary to monitor the program's effectiveness. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should work with CARICOM countries to establish an educational exchange program under which U.S. secondary and higher education students study in CARICOM countries. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary, through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), to establish a program to provide educational development assistance for CARICOM countries by: (1) enhancing teacher training; (2) strengthening curriculum and instructional materials; and (3) assisting improvements in school management and public administration of education. Directs the Secretary to monitor the program's effectiveness. (Sec. 6) States that to the maximum extent possible the programs under this Act should be implemented through private funding and through partnerships with appropriate U.S. organizations, institutions, and corporations. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on implementing plans for such programs. (Sec. 8) Authorizes FY2008-FY2012 appropriations.</summary>
