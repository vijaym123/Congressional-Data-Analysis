  <summary>9/19/2007--Introduced.
Increasing Education Opportunities for Nurses and Nurse Faculty Act of 2007 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to award grants to nursing schools to enhance their capacity to accommodate additional students in: (1) Registered Nurse (RN) associate or baccalaureate degree programs; or (2) graduate programs for prospective teachers of nursing or RNs who seek advanced practice degrees. Bases the amount of a school's grant on the extent to which the school increases its enrollment of nursing students for an academic year over its average nursing student enrollment for the four preceding academic years. Prohibits the use of grants to construct new facilities.</summary>
