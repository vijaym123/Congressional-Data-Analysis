    "text": "Minnesota Chippewa Tribe Judgment Fund Distribution Act of 2007 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to reimburse to each of the Boise Forte Band, Fond du Lac Band, Grand Portage Band, Leech Lake Band, Mille Lacs Band, and White Earth Band the amount of funds plus interest earned to the date of reimbursement that each Band contributed for payment of litigation expenses and expert witness fees associated with the litigation of Docket No. 19 and Docket No. 188 before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Provides for reimbursement to a Band only for litigation expenses and expert witness fees incurred prior to June 22, 1999. Requires that a Band's claim for reimbursement of expended funds be certified by the Band as being unreimbursed to it from other funding sources. Requires the Secretary to review the claims and determine if the fees and expenses are properly documented and incurred in the litigation of the claims before the Court in Docket Nos. 19 and 188. Requires the Bands to update their membership rolls to include all living enrolled members. Subjects the membership rolls to the review and approval of the Secretary. Sets forth provisions for the: (1) division of the judgment funds; and (2) development of separate tribal plans for the use and distribution of such funds."
