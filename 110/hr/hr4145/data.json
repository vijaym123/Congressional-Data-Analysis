Prohibits any election recount until all provisional votes have been counted. Requires the chief state election official, in determining whether to count a provisional vote, to review not only official registered voter lists but also any information an individual voter submitted during the registration process. Requires a provisional ballot in a federal election to be treated as a voter registration application if it is rejected on the ground that the individual is not registered to vote in the election."
