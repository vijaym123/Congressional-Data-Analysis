Sets forth requirements if such a grant is used for a family drug treatment program that is an alternative to incarceration. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to award grants for services in connection with the treatment of methamphetamine use or addiction to underserved populations.Requires the Secretary, through the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, to conduct a study to identify and evaluate methamphetamine use and addiction treatment methodologies."
