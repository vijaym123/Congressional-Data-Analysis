  <summary>7/30/2008--Passed House amended.
Veterans' Health Care Policy Enhancement Act of 2008 - (Sec. 2) Prohibits the collection by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) of copayments or other fees for hospital or nursing home care in the case of catastrophically disabled veterans. (Sec. 3) Repeals a current requirement that, in order for a family member of a non-service-connected disabled veteran to be eligible for counseling services, the counseling must be essential to permit the discharge of the veteran from the hospital. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to: (1) develop and implement a comprehensive policy on the management of pain experienced by veterans enrolled for VA health care services; (2) periodically revise the policy; and (3) report annually through FY2018 to the congressional veterans' committees on policy implementation. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary, within five years after the enactment of this Act, to establish up to seven consolidated patient accounting centers for conducting industry-modeled regionalized VA billing and collection activities. (Sec. 6) Repeals a provision of the Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 requiring written informed consent for HIV testing among veterans.</summary>
