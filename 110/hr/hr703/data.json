Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act with respect to delegation only to the Deputy Secretary of Energy, without redelegation, of the Secretary's authority, direction, and control of the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security. Excepts NNSA activities enumerated in this Act from the exclusive scope of such delegation. (Thus allows the Secretary to delegate oversight of such activities elsewhere within the Department of Energy.)"
