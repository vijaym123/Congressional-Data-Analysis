Authorizes additional FY2008-FY2010 appropriations for: (1) contributions to the United Nations Drug Control Program; and (2) the crop substitution program. Directs the President to report to Congress every 180 days through FY2010 respecting implementation of the crop substitution program.

(Sec. 104) Directs the President to provide Congress with an annual certification of whether any senior official of the government of Afghanistan, at the provincial or local levels, is engaged in or benefits from the illicit narcotics trade or is engaged in terrorist or criminal activities.

Expresses the sense of Congress that such assistance to eligible foreign countries and international organizations should: (1) promote greater interoperability with and among the military forces of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the United States, and the government of Afghanistan; and (2) be used in part to protect women legislators when they return to their respective provinces. (Sec. 203) Authorizes the President to provide a subsidy of up to 5% of the acquisition cost of U.S. defense items if the purchasing nation will use such items or comparable defense items it already possesses in military operations in Afghanistan for an extended period of time.

Directs the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the feasibility of specified additions to such assistance programs. (Sec. 215) Expresses the sense of Congress that the U.N. Security Council should expand the UN mandate in Afghanistan to: (1) authorize international civilian law enforcement missions as a part of the peace operations in Afghanistan; (2) authorize, with the government of Afghanistan's concurrence, ISAF to participate in counter-drug interdiction operations; (3) centralize authority within the United Nations Special Representative for Afghanistan; and (4) extend ISAF's authorization beyond October 13, 2007. (Sec. 216) Directs the Secretary of Defense to report to the appropriate congressional committees every six months on the sale and use of Iranian-made weapons for the Taliban in Afghanistan. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 301) Extends the donor contributions to Afghanistan reporting requirement through December 31, 2010.
