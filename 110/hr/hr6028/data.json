(Sec. 115) Authorizes FY2008-FY2010 appropriations to carry out this subtitle, with not more that specified amounts allocated to the armed forces for each of FY2008-2010.

(Sec. 214) Prohibits providing assistance to any armed forces or law enforcement unit of a Central American country if the Secretary determines that there is credible evidence that such unit has committed gross human rights violations.

(Sec. 302) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) activities undertaken under titles I and II should be performed by employees and officers of the recipient country; and (2) the United States should limit the number of U.S. contractors. Caps: (1) at 50 the number of U.S. citizens or foreign nationals that may be retained as contractors to carry out title I (Mexico); and (2) at 100 the number of U.S. citizens or foreign nationals that may be retained as contractors to carry out Title II (Central America). Prohibits funds under this Act from being made available for budget support or cash payments. Provides for a national interest waiver.

(Sec. 304) Authorizes the President, notwithstanding a specified prohibition, to provide assistance under title I or title II to the police forces of recipient countries. (Sec. 305) States that authority to provide assistance under titles I and II is in addition to any other authority to provide assistance for Mexico and the countries of Central America. (Sec. 306) States that the Arms Export Control Act applies to all transfers of equipment under this Act unless otherwise specified.
