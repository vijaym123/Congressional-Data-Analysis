  <summary>6/4/2008--Reported to House without amendment, Part I.
Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to prepare a two-part study of potential impacts of climate change on water resources and water quality, addressing issues of: (1) hydrology and water quality (including the potential for impacts to wetlands, shoreline erosion, and saltwater intrusion as a result of sea level rise, as well as significant regional variation in precipitation events from historic patterns); and (2) policy considerations (including an identification of the scientific consensus, assumptions, and uncertainties related to predictions of climate change in the United States and of steps to assess emerging information and identify appropriate response actions, and an assessment of the extent to which federal and state efforts under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and other ocean and coastal laws may be affected by climate change). Requires the Administrator to report the results of the study to specified congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
