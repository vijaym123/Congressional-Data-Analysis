Security Council sanctions against Iran; (2) implemented an export control regime in accordance with international standards and has implemented legislative and functional actions to target the logistical and financial networks that support terrorist organizations; (3) terminated all related cooperation between any UAE national and the government of Iran, any Iranian national, or any Iranian-controlled entity, and has prosecuted any such UAE national, and (4) not engaged in or condoned activities that violate the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, and other applicable U.S. law. Amends the the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require congressional approval of an agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation (section 123 agreement). (Under current law such an agreement become effective unless Congress disapproves it within a specified time period.) Directs the President to keep the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations fully informed of any initiative or negotiations relating to a new or amended section 123 agreement."
