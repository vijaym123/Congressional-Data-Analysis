Informed P2P User Act - Makes it unlawful for any person who is not the owner or authorized user of a protected computer to cause or induce the owner or authorized user of the protected computer to install any component of a peer-to-peer file sharing program that intentionally obtains files on the protected computer, or makes such files available to another computer without first providing clear and conspicuous notice that such program obtains files on the protected computer, or makes such files available to another computer, and obtaining the informed consent to the installation of such program for such activities from the owner or authorized user of the protected computer. Makes it unlawful for any person who is not the owner or authorized user of a protected computer to prevent reasonable efforts by such owner or authorized user to: (1) block the installation of a peer-to-peer file sharing program that intentionally obtains files on the protected computer or makes such files available to another computer; or (2) disable or remove any peer-to-peer file sharing program that intentionally obtains files on the protected computer or makes such files available to another computer. Treats a violation of this Act as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under the Federal Trade Commission Act.</summary>
