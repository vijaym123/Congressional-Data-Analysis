Amends the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to provide that, in any action or proceeding instituted by the SEC in federal district court for any judicial district, subpoenas issued by or on behalf of such court to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents or tangible things (or both) may be served in any other district (thus granting the SEC nationwide service of process)."
