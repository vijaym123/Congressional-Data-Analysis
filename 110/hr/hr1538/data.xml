Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act - Title I: Wounded Warrior Matters - Subtitle A: Policy on Care, Management, and Transition of Servicemembers With Serious Injuries or Illnesses - (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs (Secretaries) to: (1) jointly develop and implement a comprehensive policy on the care and management of members of the Armed Forces (members) who are undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, are in medical hold or holdover status, or are otherwise on the temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or illness (recovering members); (2) jointly update the policy on a periodic basis (at least annually); and (3) jointly and separately review all policies and procedures of the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that apply to, or are covered by, the comprehensive policy. Requires such review to be completed within 90 days after the enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretaries, in developing the policy, to take into account specified findings, recommendations, and practices, including those of the Independent Review Group on Rehabilitative Care and Administrative Processes at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and National Naval Medical Center. Requires the policy developed to include: (1) mechanisms to ensure responsibility for recovering members in medical hold or holdover status or on the temporary disability retired list; (2) processes, procedures, and standards for medical evaluations and physical disability evaluations of recovering members; (3) standards for determinations of the return of recovering members to active duty; (4) standards for the transition of recovering members from care and treatment by DOD to care and treatment by the VA before, during, and after separation from service; (5) VA access to military health records of recovering members; and (6) surveys and other mechanisms to measure patient and family satisfaction with the DOD and VA provision of care and services. Requires a report from: (1) the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to the congressional defense committees on instances when a disability rating assigned to a member by an informal physical evaluation board of DOD was reduced upon appeal, and the reasons for such reduction; (2) the Secretaries to the defense and veterans committees on the policy developed, as well as on policy updates; and (3) the Comptroller General (CG) annually to the defense and veterans committees assessing DOD and VA progress in developing and implementing the policy. (Sec. 112) Requires the Secretaries, in developing and implementing the policy, to: (1) take into account and fully address any unique needs of women members and women veterans; and (2) include a description of such needs, and the manner in which they are addressed, in any reports required under the previous section. Subtitle B: Health Care - Part I: Enhanced Availability of Care for Servicemembers - (Sec. 121) Entitles any recovering member and any former member with a severe injury or illness to medical and dental care in any military medical facility or through any civilian health care provider authorized by the Secretary to provide health and mental health services, including services for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Authorizes such medical and dental care for three years beginning on the date: (1) of enactment of this Act, for those whose injury or illness was incurred on or after October 7, 2001, and before the enactment of this Act; and (2) on which the injury or illness is incurred, for those whose injury or illness occurs on or after the enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to waive any limitation on the provision of such care if considered appropriate to assure the maximum feasible recovery and rehabilitation of the member or former member. Prohibits the Secretary from providing such medical and dental care after December 31, 2012, if the Secretary has not provided such care to such member or former member before that date. Entitles members with a severe injury or illness to rehabilitation and vocational benefits from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned (Secretary concerned) to reimburse recovering members and former members with a severe injury or illness for certain expenses incurred in connection with the receipt of required medical care. (Sec. 122) Requires the Secretary to provide reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses for follow-on specialty care and related services of a former member who incurred a disability while on active duty in a combat zone or in combat-related operations, is entitled to retired or retainer pay, and requires follow-up care, services, or supplies at a specific military treatment facility located more than 100 miles away from the member's residence. Part II: Care and Services for Dependents - (Sec. 126) Makes a family member of a recovering member eligible for medical care at a military treatment facility if the family member is: (1) on invitational orders while caring for the member; (2) a non-medical attendee caring for the member; or (3) receiving per-diem payments from DOD while caring for the member. Makes a family member who is eligible for medical care under (1), above, for more than 45 days during a one-year period also eligible for job placement services offered by DOD. Requires a report from the Secretary to the defense committees on the need for additional employment services and job protection for family members who are placed on leave or displaced from employment while caring for a recovering member. (Sec. 127) Provides extended benefits under TRICARE (a DOD managed care program) for the primary caregivers of members who incur a serious injury or illness while on active duty. Part III: Traumatic Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - (Sec. 131) Directs the Secretary to submit to the defense committees one or more comprehensive plans for DOD programs and activities to prevent, diagnose, mitigate, treat, and otherwise respond to TBI and PTSD in members. (Sec. 132) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a protocol for the predeployment assessment and documentation of the cognitive functioning of a member who is deployed outside the United States, in order to facilitate the assessment of the postdeployment cognitive functioning of such member; (2) conduct up to three pilot projects to evaluate various mechanisms for use in the protocol; (3) report to the defense and veterans committees on the pilot projects; and (4) after completion of the pilot projects, establish the appropriate mechanism for use in the protocol. Authorizes appropriations.
