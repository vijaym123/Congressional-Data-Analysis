Deems the registration to be cleared if the Secretary fails to act within 90 days.Requires the Secretary to establish a program to maintain information regarding registrations under this Act.Directs the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, to establish a program to gather information from practitioners regarding surgical procedures and make such information publicly available.Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine to establish a program to gather information from health care practitioners regarding alternative medicine and make such information publicly available.Gives a drug or device company immunity from federal and state liability claims for: (1) the use of a relevant unapproved treatment by a practitioner under a cleared registration; and (2) the provision by the company of information upon the request of a practitioner if the company reasonably believes the information to be accurate."
