(Sec. 203) Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should continue to: (1) support a Democracy Caucus at the United Nations and that the creation of a Democracy Caucus in each international organization and multilateral institution of which the United States is a member will improve their internal governance and strengthen democracy and human rights commitments; and (2) work with other countries to enhance the United Nations Democracy Fund. Authorizes FY2008-FY2009 appropriations for a U.S. contribution to the United Nations Democracy Fund.
