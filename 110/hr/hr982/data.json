    "text": "Advance Democratic Values, Address Nondemocratic Countries, and Enhance Democracy Act of 2007 or ADVANCE Democracy Act of 2007 - Title I: Department of State Activities - (Sec. 101) Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to provide that the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor shall also be responsible for matters relating to the development of democracy in nondemocratic countries.

(Sec. 102) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require that Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices include long-term strategies for ending serious human rights violations, and achieving a transition to full democracy with respect to nondemocratic and democratic transition countries.

Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) regional groups within the Community of Democracies should be strengthened; (2) the United States should support Hungary and other European countries to establish an International Center for Democratic Transition (authorizes FY2008-FY2010 appropriations); and (3) the Secretary should establish an office of multilateral democracy promotion to address democracy promotion activities in international organizations. (Sec. 203) Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should continue to: (1) support a Democracy Caucus at the United Nations and that the creation of a Democracy Caucus in each international organization and multilateral institution of which the United States is a member will improve their internal governance and strengthen democracy and human rights commitments; and (2) work with other countries to enhance the United Nations Democracy Fund. Authorizes FY2008-FY2009 appropriations for a U.S. contribution to the United Nations Democracy Fund. Title III: Funding for Promotion of Democracy - (Sec. 301) States that it shall be U.S. policy to provide financial assistance to eligible entities and individuals in order to promote democracy in nondemocratic countries and democratic transition countries.

Authorizes FY2008-FY2009 appropriations for the Human Rights and Democracy Fund.
