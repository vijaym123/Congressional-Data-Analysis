Requires such metrics to include: (1) a quantitative definition of \"significant increase in operational effectiveness\"; (2) all relevant threat materials; (3) all relevant masking scenarios; and (4) cost-benefit analysis in accordance with the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.Permits the Secretary, in determining whether to certify that ASP shows a significant increase in operational effectiveness, to consider: (1) relevant reports on ASP from the Government Accountability Office (GAO); and (2) assessments of ASP by the Independent Review Team led by the Homeland Security Institute in consultation with the National Archives.Authorizes appropriations to the Director for FY2009 and for each subsequent fiscal year for the Securing the Cities Initiative."
