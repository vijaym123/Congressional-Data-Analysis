Judgment Evading Foreign States Accountability Act of 2008 - Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to deny a judgment evading foreign state (as defined by this Act) access to U.S. capital markets unless the proceeds of such borrowing or sale are to be used to satisfy in full all final judgments that form the basis for such designation as a judgment evading foreign state. Requires: (1) a proposal to extend bilateral or multilateral assistance to a judgment evading state to bear notice that such state is a judgment evading state; and (2) the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to Congress identifying each such state.</summary>
