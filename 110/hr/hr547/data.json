Cites problem areas to be addressed, including microbial contamination. Directs the Assistant Administrator to: (1) implement a research, development, demonstration program on portable, low-cost, and accurate methods and technologies for testing sulfur content in fuel, including Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel and Low Sulfur Diesel; and (2) begin demonstrations of such technologies within a year after enactment of this Act. Directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a physical properties database and standard reference materials for biofuels. Authorizes appropriations to EPA to implement this Act."
