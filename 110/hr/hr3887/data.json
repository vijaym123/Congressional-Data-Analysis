(Sec. 103) Directs the President to carry out programs to prevent and deter trafficking in persons, including related assistance to foreign governments. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide anti-trafficking assistance to foreign countries for investigations of individuals and entities involved in sexual exploitation. (Sec. 105) Requires, both in the United States and abroad, that solicitations of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts for anti-trafficking programs be made publicly available and that the award of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts be made on a full and open competitive basis. Directs the President to: (1) establish related performance goals and indicators; and (2) ensure that U.S. development and emergency programs are carried out consistent with policies and programs to combat trafficking. Requires the Director to provide U.S. assistance consistent with annual reporting priorities and country assessments. Obligates specified FY2008-FY2011 funds for activities under this section. (Sec. 106) Repeals the limitation that only countries with a significant number of trafficking victims be monitored. Revises the criteria for determining whether a country is making significant efforts to combat trafficking, including the addition of criteria respecting: (1) law enforcement and immigration training in the identification and treatment of trafficking victims; and (2) efforts to reduce commercial sex acts and sex tourism. (Sec. 107) Deems a country that has been on the special watch list for two consecutive years to be not making significant efforts to combat trafficking unless the Secretary of State determines that the country: (1) has a written plan that would constitute making such efforts; and (2) is devoting sufficient resources to the plan's implementation.

Prohibits A-3 or G-5 visa issuance if the individual who would hire such alien is from a diplomatic mission or international institution where trafficking or other abuse has previously occurred or an individual has departed the United States because of such abuse unless a mechanism is in place to prevent future abuse. Requires the Secretary of State to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on diplomatic missions and international institutions affected, exceptions made, and waivers of diplomatic immunity requested. (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary of Labor to report on Department of Labor progress in monitoring and combatting forced labor and child labor. (Sec. 112) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should seek to establish a multilateral framework between labor exporting and labor importing countries to ensure that workers migrating between such countries are protected from trafficking in persons and worker exploitation.
