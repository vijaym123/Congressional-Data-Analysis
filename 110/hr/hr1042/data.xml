Trade Promotion Authority Extension and Enhancement Act of 2007 - Amends the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 to extend the President's authority until July 1, 2011 (or until July 1, 2016, and July 1 of each fifth year thereafter if the President extends such authority and the Congress approves) to enter into trade agreements with foreign countries whose tariff and nontariff policies unduly burden or restrict U.S. trade or adversely affects the U.S. economy. Extends trade authorities procedures (congressional approval) to bills implementing trade agreements entered into during the five-year period beginning on July 1, 2011, and during each five-year period thereafter, unless Congress disapproves after April 1, and before July 1, of the year in which any such five-year period begins.</summary>
