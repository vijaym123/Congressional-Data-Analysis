Cybersecurity Education Enhancement Act of 2008 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Cybersecurity, to establish a program awarding competitive grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) and consortia of IHEs for: (1) cybersecurity professional development programs; (2) associate degree programs in cybersecurity; and (3) the purchase of equipment to provide training in cybersecurity for professional development and degree programs. Gives grant priority to consortia of IHEs and such consortia that include IHEs eligible to receive funds under title III (Institutional Aid) or V (Developing Institutions) of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Authorizes FY2009-FY2010 appropriations for the grant program. Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary to establish a DHS Cybersecurity Fellows program to bring state, local, tribal, and private sector officials to participate in the work of the National Cybersecurity Division in order to assist with Department of Homeland Security's stated cybersecurity missions and capabilities. Urges the House of Representatives to designate a committee to serve as the single, principal point of cybersecurity oversight and review.</summary>
