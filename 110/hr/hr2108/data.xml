Human and Pet Food Safety Act of 2007 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to require a person that has reason to believe that any food introduced into interstate commerce may be in violation of the FFDCA to immediately notify the Secretary of the Health and Human Services of the identity and location of the food.Requires the Secretary, upon a determination that such food is in violation of the FFDCA and that there is a reasonable probability that the food, if consumed, would present a threat to the public health, to give appropriate persons an opportunity to: (1) cease distribution of the food; (2) notify all relevant persons to cease distribution of the food; (3) recall the food; and (4) provide notice to consumers and public health officials. Authorizes the Secretary to control and possess the food and to order the person to immediately cease distribution of the food if the person refuses or does not adequately carry out such actions.Sets forth certification and inspection requirements for foreign governments and foreign firms seeking to import food into the Unites States.Directs the Secretary to take certain action during an ongoing recall of human or pet food, including posting information regarding recalled products on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website.Requires the Secretary to establish: (1) processing and ingredient standards for feed, pet food, animal waste, and ingredient definitions; (2) update standards for pet food labeling that includes nutritional information and ingredient information; and (3) an early warning and surveillance system to identify contaminations of the pet food supply and outbreaks of illness from pet food.</summary>
