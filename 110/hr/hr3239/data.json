Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to provide grants to hybrid component manufacturers to encourage domestic production of plug-in electric hybrid vehicles. Authorizes the Secretary to coordinate such grant program with similar state and local programs, including by: (1) establishing matching grant arrangements; and (2) retaining and retraining skilled workers from manufacturing facilities that have recently closed or will close in the near future to produce plug-in electric hybrid vehicles and hybrid components. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to: (1) revise the definition of \"alternative fueled vehicle\" to include medium or heavy duty hybrid vehicles for purposes of provisions requiring the acquisition of such vehicles for federal and state fleets; and (2) allow a credit to a fleet that, or covered person who, acquires certain electric drive vehicles. Authorizes appropriations. Requires: (1) a market assessment to be made for electric drive transportation technologies and hybrid technologies; (2) a study of the implications of the use of plug-in electric vehicles and other types of electric transportation on the electric grid and on the production of electricity from renewable sources; and (3) the Secretary to provide grants to eligible electric utilities to conduct programs to encourage owners of electric drive transportation technologies to use off-peak electricity. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study, and report to Congress on, the benefits of and barriers to widespread use of plug-in hybrid electric drive vehicles and plug-in electric drive vehicles (city cars). Authorizes appropriations."
