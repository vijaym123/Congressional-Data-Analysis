Directs the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress on such regulations' effectiveness by September 30, 2010. Requires that such report shall include an analysis of a random sample of non-minister special immigrant religious workers, before their second anniversary of being admitted, to determine whether they are still employed by the religious organization that petitioned for them, and if not, the reasons for their departure from such employment."
