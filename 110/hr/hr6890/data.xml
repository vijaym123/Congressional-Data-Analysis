  <summary>10/8/2008--Public Law.
Amends the Hurricane Education Recovery Act, title IV of division B of the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006, with respect to elementary and secondary education hurricane recovery relief. Extends through FY2009 the authority of the Secretary of Education, in providing any grant or other assistance to an entity in a state which in 2005 suffered a major disaster related to Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita, to waive or modify, in order to ease fiscal burdens, any elementary and secondary education assistance requirement relating to: (1) maintenance of effort; (2) use of federal funds to supplement, not supplant, non-federal funds; or (3) any non-federal share or capital contribution required to match federal funds. Protects local educational agencies that serve areas in which a major disaster has been declared in 2008 related to severe storms, tornadoes, or flooding in the Midwest or hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, from experiencing a FY2009 reduction of school improvement funds under part A of title I (Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.</summary>
