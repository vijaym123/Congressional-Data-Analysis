Extends through FY2009 the authority of the Secretary of Education, in providing any grant or other assistance to an entity in a state which in 2005 suffered a major disaster related to Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita, to waive or modify, in order to ease fiscal burdens, any elementary and secondary education assistance requirement relating to: (1) maintenance of effort; (2) use of federal funds to supplement, not supplant, non-federal funds; or (3) any non-federal share or capital contribution required to match federal funds. Protects local educational agencies that serve areas in which a major disaster has been declared in 2008 related to severe storms, tornadoes, or flooding in the Midwest or hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, from experiencing a FY2009 reduction of school improvement funds under part A of title I (Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
