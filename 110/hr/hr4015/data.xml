  <summary>10/31/2007--Introduced.
Job Protection for Survivors Act - Prohibits an employer from failing to hire, or to discharge, harass, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to his or her employment because he or she was a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Entitles such employee to: (1) a total of 15 days of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to obtain certain victim services; and (2) leave for court proceedings resulting from an incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Makes it unlawful for an employer to interfere with, or discriminate against, any employee exercising any right provided under this Act. Authorizes an employee to file an action for damages or equitable relief in federal or state court against an employer who violates the requirements of this Act. Requires the Secretary of Labor to investigate and resolve complaints of violations of this Act.</summary>
