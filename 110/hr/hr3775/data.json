Requires all awards given under such program to made on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis.Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on such activities.(Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary to provide funding to university-based industrial research and assessment centers to: (1) identify opportunities for optimizing energy efficiency and environmental performance; (2) promote application of emerging concepts and technologies in small and medium-sized manufacturers; (3) promote the research and development for use of alternative energy sources for energy intensive industries; (4) coordinate with state research offices and provide a clearinghouse for industrial process and energy efficiency technical assistance resources; and (5) coordinate with state-accredited technical training centers and community colleges, while ensuring appropriate services to all regions of the United States.Authorizes appropriations."
