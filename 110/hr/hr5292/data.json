    "text": "Amends provisions of title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act (popularly known as the Ryan White Care Act [RWCA]) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to administer certain RWCA grants in lieu of the chief elected official of an eligible area or state if the Secretary determines that the eligible area or state has substantially failed to make appropriate use of such grants during either of the two previous fiscal years.Provides that the Secretary is not authorized to administer any such grant to an eligible area or state in consecutive fiscal years.Requires the Secretary in making a determination under this Act to consider whether: (1) more than 5% of the grant funds awarded remained unobligated one year after the date on which the grant was made; (2) the eligible area or state has had additional requirements imposed on the grant under applicable federal regulations; or (3) the eligible area or state has had special conditions or restrictions imposed on the grant.Allows the Secretary to delegate to a federal instrumentality or private entity the authority to administer such grant."
