Makes unenforceable agreements between an employer and employee requiring arbitration of disputes arising under USERRA. Provides exceptions. Requires the validity and enforceability of such an agreement to be determined by a court (as opposed to the arbitrator). Provides increased liquidated damages, and authorizes punitive damages, against state or private employer violations of USERRA. Provides a right to a jury trial in such cases. Requires (current law authorizes) the award of attorney fees in actions to enforce USERRA. Defines \"successor in interest\" for USERRA purposes. Prohibits: (1) any statute of limitations from applying to USERRA proceedings; and (2) wage discrimination against members covered under USERRA. Requires (current law authorizes) a court to use equitable relief, including injunctions and restraining orders when appropriate, for USERRA violations."
