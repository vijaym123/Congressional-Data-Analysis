Requires the development of an AmeriCare enrollment mechanism that includes automatic enrollment at birth and the issuance of AmeriCare cards for identification and claims processing purposes.Provides that an individual may elect not to be enrolled for benefits under AmeriCare if the individual has health benefits coverage under a group health plan at least equivalent to AmeriCare coverage.Provides the same benefits under AmeriCare as are provided under parts A (Hospital Insurance) and B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of SSA title XVIII (Medicare).Provides additional AmeriCare coverage to children under age 24, pregnant women, and low-income individuals. Establishes the AmeriCare Trust Fund.Requires the modification of Medicaid (SSA title XIX), SCHIP (SSA title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program), and other federal health programs to avoid their duplication of AmeriCare coverage. Provides for the regulation of AmeriCare supplemental policies.Establishes the general obligations for individuals and employers for the cost of health insurance coverage provided under this Act.
