Directs the President to coordinate with oil and natural gas producers on the North Slope of Alaska, and other specified entities, to expedite construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska to U.S. markets. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to repeal provisions authorizing the export of Alaskan North Slope oil. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to reimpose the prohibition against crude oil exports. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from authorizing any new lease for exploration or production of oil or natural gas unless the lessee: (1) certifies for each existing lease that the lessee has diligently developed the pertinent federal lands in order to produce oil or natural gas, or is producing oil or natural gas from them; or (2) has relinquished all federal oil and gas leases that are not being diligently developed. Instructs the Secretary to ensure that lessees under leases for exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas on federal lands make prompt, transparent, and accurate royalty payments."
