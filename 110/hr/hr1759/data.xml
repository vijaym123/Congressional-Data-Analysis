  <summary>12/5/2007--Passed House amended.
Managing Arson Through Criminal History (MATCH) Act of 2007 - Requires jurisdictions (i.e., states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and possessions, and federally recognized Indian tribes) to establish and maintain a jurisdiction-wide arsonist registry.Requires a criminal arsonist to register, and keep such registration current, in each jurisdiction in which such arsonist resides, is an employee, or is a student. Sets forth other registration requirements and information required to be included in a registry, including the name, address, and social security number of the arsonist, a physical description of the arsonist, a set of fingerprints and palm prints, and a photocopy of the arsonist's driver's license or identification card. Permits expungement of registry information for certain juveniles not convicted of any other criminal felony during the registration period. Requires criminal arsonists to verify information in the registry annually. Requires appropriate officials to notify criminal arsonists of their duty to register before release from custody.Requires each jurisdiction to make all information about each criminal arsonist available to law enforcement personnel and fire safety officers through the Internet. Prohibits public access to such information. Prohibits jurisdictions from disclosing information about other convictions involving the arsonist not requiring registration and allows jurisdictions to exempt from disclosure information about an arsonist's employer and enrollment at an educational institution. Requires the Attorney General to maintain a national database at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to be known as the National Arsonist Registry and a national arsonist Internet site containing information on each criminal arsonist registered in a jurisdiction's registry or listed on a jurisdiction's Internet site, respectively. Requires jurisdictions to comply with the requirements of this Act within three years after its enactment or one year after registry management and website software is provided to such jurisdictions by the Attorney General. Withholds 10% of grant funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program from states that fail to comply with requirements of this Act. Directs the Attorney General to establish and implement a Criminal Arsonist Management Assistance program for awarding grants to jurisdictions to offset the costs of implementing this Act.</summary>
