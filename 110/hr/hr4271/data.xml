Amends the Clean Air Act to: (1) apply the authority of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to waive prohibitions on the introduction into commerce, or an increase in the concentration, of certain fuels or fuel additives when an applicant has established that they will not contribute to the failure of emission control systems of motor vehicles to fuels and additives for motor vehicle engines, nonroad engines, or nonroad vehicles as well; and (2) require the Administrator to grant or deny a waiver application, after public notice and comment, within 270 days after its receipt (currently, a waiver application must be treated as granted if the Administrator has not acted within 180 days of its receipt).</summary>
