Requires: (1) the PUD to pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the appraised value of the public land, as determined according to this Act; and (2) any costs related to such conveyance to be paid by the PUD. Requires the deposit of the proceeds from such land sale in the Federal Land Disposal Account established pursuant to the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, which shall be spent for improving access to public lands administered by the BLM in the state of Washington. Withdraws the public land from: (1) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patenting under the mining laws; and (3) operation of the mineral leasing, mineral materials, and geothermal leasing laws. Terminates such requirement for withdrawal of the public land two years after enactment of this Act or upon the completion of the conveyance under this Act. Instructs the Secretary to retain the authority to place conditions on the license granted to the Secretary under the Federal Power Act to insure adequate protection and utilization of the public land until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued a new license for the Wells Hydroelectric Project to replace the original license expiring on May 31, 2012."
