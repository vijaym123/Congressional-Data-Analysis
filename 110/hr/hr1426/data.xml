(Currently, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs may contract for such services when VA facilities are not capable of furnishing economic hospital care or medical services because of geographical inaccessibility or are not capable of furnishing the care or services required.)

Authorizes the Secretary to furnish to veterans through a VA health care facility drugs and medicines ordered on prescription of a duly licensed private physician under contract with the VA.</summary>
