Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians and the Governor of Michigan executed on December 30, 2002, including the document titled \"Addendum to Settlement of Land Claim,\" executed on November 14, 2007) into trust for the benefit of the Tribe within 30 days after the Secretary has: (1) received a title insurance policy for the alternative lands that shows that such lands are not subject to mortgages, liens, deeds of trust, options to purchase, or other security interests; and (2) confirmed that the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 has been complied with regarding the trust acquisition of the property.Provides for the alternative lands to become part of the Tribe's reservation immediately upon attaining trust status. Requires the alternative lands to be taken into trust as part of the settlement and extinguishment of the Tribe's Charlotte Beach land claims and to be deemed lands obtained in settlement of a land claim within the meaning of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.Extinguishes all claims by the Tribe to the Charlotte Beach lands or against the United States, the State of Michigan, or any other person or entity based on or relating to claims to such lands, whether based on aboriginal or recognized title, upon: (1) the Secretary having taken the alternative lands into trust for the benefit of the Tribe; and (2) congressional acceptance of the extinguishment of such claims to the Charlotte Beach lands by the Bay Mills Indian Community.Approves and ratifies the Settlement of Land Claim, which shall be enforceable by the Tribe or the Governor according to its terms. Vests exclusive jurisdiction over any enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan."
