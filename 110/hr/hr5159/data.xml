Grants authority to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and the House Committee on House Administration (Committees) to exercise oversight over the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC). Declares that certain "unassigned" expansion space for the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be treated as parts of the Senate and House wings of the Capitol. Requires the Committees to jointly prescribe regulations for the CVC's Congressional Auditorium and the related adjacent areas. Authorizes the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) to enter into loan agreements to place historical objects for display in the CVC's Exhibition Hall.

Title IV: Capitol Guide Service and Office of Congressional Accessibility Services - Subtitle A: Capitol Guide Service - (Sec. 401) Transfers the authorities and personnel of the Capitol Guide Service (CGS) to the Office of the CVC.

Makes a transferred individual eligible for immediate retirement on the basis of involuntary separation under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) if the individual has completed: (1) 25 years of service; or (2) 20 years of service and is 50 years of age or older.

(Sec. 412) Transfers the authorities and personnel of the Congressional Special Services Office of the CGS to such Office.

Declares that nothing in this Act granting any authority to the CEO shall be construed to affect the exclusive jurisdiction of the AOC for the CVC's care and superintendence.
