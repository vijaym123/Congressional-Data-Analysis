Provides citizenship or nationality at birth for a person born in the United States only if such child was born to parents, one of whom is: (1) a U.S. citizen or national; or (2) a lawful permanent resident alien. Authorizes the use of the military to help secure the borders. Provides for increases of immigration and border enforcement personnel. Suspends the visa waiver program. Provides criminal penalties and forfeiture for unlawful presence in the United States. Provides for listing of immigration violators in the National Crime Information Center Database. Increases civil and criminal penalties for document fraud, benefit fraud, and false citizenship claims. Sets forth an identification standard for federal benefits. Requires electronic fingerprinting for U.S. passports. Authorizes visa term compliance bonds. Establishes minimum birth certificate standards for federal recognition purposes.

Renames the basic employment verification pilot program as the Employment Authorization Status Instant Check or EASI Check system and makes such system permanent and mandatory on a phased-in basis. Increases civil and criminal penalties for employer hiring violations. Provides for temporary social security cards for non-immigrant aliens authorized to work in the United States. Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to notify: (1) a U.S. employer with one or more employees whose social security account number does not match the employee's name or date of birth in Social Security Administration (SSA) records; and (2) an individual whose earnings from two or more employers are being reported under the individual's social security account number. Prohibits social security credit for work performed while unlawfully present in the United States.

Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, upon state request, to provide for the transfer of an illegal alien to federal custody and the reimbursement of related state costs. Authorizes assistance to Cameron University, Lawton, Oklahoma, for a demonstration project to assess the feasibility of establishing a nationwide e-learning training course to be used by state, local, and tribal law enforcement officers to enhance such officers' ability to assist federal immigration officers. Directs the Secretary, within two years, to complete the exit component of the entry and exit data system, (US-VISIT). Prohibits employer deduction from gross income of wages paid to unauthorized aliens. Eliminates: (1) federal reimbursement of emergency health services provided to undocumented aliens after FY2007; and (2) coverage of Mexicans with border crossing cards.
