Requires the Commission to develop a fund-raising plan for supporting the creation and maintenance of the Museum through contributions by the American people, and a separate plan on fund-raising by the American Latino community. Instructs the Commission to examine and report on: (1) the availability and cost of collections to be acquired and housed in the Museum; (2) the impact of the Museum on regional Hispanic- and Latino-related museums; (3) possible locations for the Museum in Washington, D.C.; (4) whether the Museum should be located within the Smithsonian Institution; (5) the governance and organizational structure from which the Museum should operate; (6) how to engage the American Latino community in the development and design of the Museum; and (7) the cost of constructing, operating, and maintaining the Museum. Requires the Commission, based on the recommendations contained in the reports described above, to submit for consideration to specified congressional committees recommendations for a legislative plan of action to create and construct the Museum. Authorizes the Commission to convene a national conference on the Museum, which shall be comprised of individuals committed to the advancement of American Latino life, art, history, and culture. Instructs the Department of the Interior to provide from funds appropriated for this purpose administrative services, facilities, and funds necessary for the performance of the Commission's functions. Makes such funds available prior to any meetings of the Commission. Excepts the Commission from application of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
