    "text": "New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008 or the NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008 - Title I: Services and IP-Enabled Voice Service Providers - (Sec. 101) Amends the IP-Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 to require IP-enabled voice service providers to provide 9-1-1 service, including enhanced 9-1-1 service, to their subscribers. Grants such providers, in meeting that requirement, the same rights, including rights of interconnection, on the same rates, terms, and conditions, as are provided to a provider of commercial mobile service. Allows a state or tribal fee for 9-1-1 or enhanced 9-1-1 services, provided it is used only for such services or related enhancements and provided that, for each class of IP-enabled voice services subscribers, the fee does not exceed the fee for the same class of subscribers to telecommunications services. Requires an annual report to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives detailing the status in each state of the collection and distribution of such fees. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to compile a list of public safety answering point (PSAP) contact information and other information concerning 911 elements to assist IP-enabled voice service providers in complying with requirements imposed by this Act, and to make any portion of the information available to telecommunications carriers, wireless carriers, IP-enabled voice service providers, or other emergency service providers to improve public safety. Requires the FCC to work cooperatively with public safety organizations, industry participants, and the E-911 Implementation Coordination Office to develop best practices that promote consistency, where appropriate, including procedures for defining PSAP geographic coverage areas, defining network diversity requirements for delivery of IP-enabled 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 calls, call-handling in the event of call overflow or network outages, PSAP certification and testing requirements, database validation, and the format for delivering address information to PSAPs. (Sec. 102) Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to require grants for migration to an IP-enabled emergency network. Requires the E-911 Implementation Coordination Office to develop a national plan for migrating to a national IP-enabled emergency network. Title II: Parity of Protection - (Sec. 201) Amends the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 to require, for IP-enabled voice service carriers, IP-enabled voice users of 911 communications, and public safety answering points (facilities designated to receive 911 calls and route them to emergency personnel) (PSAPs), parity in liability protection with local exchange companies, non-wireless 911 service users, and non-wireless PSAPs, respectively. Title III: Authority to Provide Customer Information for 911 Purposes - (Sec. 301) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize a telecommunications carrier to use, disclose, or permit access to call location information in emergencies. Requires IP-enabled voice service providers to provide subscriber list information to emergency service providers."
