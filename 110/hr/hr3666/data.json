Requires the Commission to make recommendations regarding: (1) ways to assist homeowners currently in danger of losing their homes; (2) ways to encourage lenders and borrowers to work together to prevent foreclosure; and (3) legislative and regulatory changes to protect homeowners against unscrupulous lending practices and strengthen accountability for those involved in the mortgage lending market."
