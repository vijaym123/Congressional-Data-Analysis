Several Approaches to Reduce the Uninsured Act of 2008 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide for state comprehensive programs under which: (1) state residents are required to obtain qualified health insurance coverage; and (2) employers are required to establish a group health plan offering such coverage.Sets forth provisions governing health coverage buy-in arrangements between states and individuals and between large and small employers for the purchase of health insurance coverage. Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to establish a qualified coverage buy-in arrangement credit.Health Partnership Through Creative Federalism Act - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a State Health Coverage Innovation Commission to facilitate state health care expansion and improvement programs.Amends title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program) (SCHIP) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary to establish demonstration projects to provide coverage under SCHIP for children who would be targeted low-income children but for coverage as beneficiaries under a group health plan as the children of participants by virtue of a qualifying employer's contribution. Requires the Secretary to facilitate the establishment of regional state arrangements under which states band together in order to increase their purchasing pooling power and offer affordable health coverage to their citizens. Provides for automatic enrollment of uninsured individuals.Preexisting Condition Exclusion Patient Protection Act of 2008 - Amends ERISA, the Public Health Service Act, and the IRC to allow a health plan to impose a preexisting condition exclusion only for: (1) a condition for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received within 30 days of the enrollment date; and (2) three months, or nine months for a late enrollee, after the enrollment date.</summary>
