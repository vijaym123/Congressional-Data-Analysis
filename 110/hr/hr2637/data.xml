  <summary>6/12/2007--Passed House without amendment.
Child Labor Protection Act of 2007 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase civil penalties for violations of: (1) child labor requirements and prohibitions; and (2) minimum wage and maximum hours requirements. Increases from $10,000 to $11,000 the maximum employer penalty for each employee who was the subject of a child labor violation. Establishes a $50,000 civil penalty for each such violation that causes the death or serious injury of any employee under age 18. Allows the doubling of such a penalty where the violation is a repeated or willful violation. Defines "serious injury" as permanent: (1) loss or substantial impairment of one of the senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, tactile sensation); (2) loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty, including the loss of all or part of an arm, leg, foot, hand or other body part; or (3) permanent paralysis or substantial impairment that causes loss of movement or mobility of an arm, leg, foot, hand or other body part. Increases from $1,000 to $1,100 the civil penalty for any repeated or willful violation of specified minimum wage or maximum hours requirements of such Act.</summary>
