Expands the conditions under which persons (i.e., partnerships, corporations, and associations) are subject to mandatory and permissive debarment preventing such persons from submitting an application for approval of a drug product.Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in determining the appropriateness and the period of debarment, to consider whether debarment will affect the public health because sufficient quantities of the drug would not be available.Requires the Secretary to annually report to Congress on the implementation of debarment provisions."
