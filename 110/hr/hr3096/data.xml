Vietnam Human Rights Act of 2007 - Title I: Prohibition on Nonhumanitarian Assistance to the Government of Vietnam - (Sec. 101) Prohibits U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to the government of Vietnam for FY2008 in excess of FY2007 levels unless the President certifies to Congress that the government of Vietnam has made substantial progress respecting: (1) the release of political and religious prisoners; (2) the right of religious freedom, including the return of church properties; (3) the rights of ethnic minorities; and (4) access to U.S. refugee programs by Vietnamese nationals. Prohibits U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to the government of Vietnam for subsequent fiscal years in excess of FY2007 levels unless the President certifies to Congress that in addition to such requirements: (1) no government of Vietnam official, agency, or entity wholly or partly owned by the government of Vietnam was complicit in a severe form of trafficking in persons; or (2) the government of Vietnam took all appropriate steps to end any such complicity and hold any official, agency, or entity accountable for such conduct. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition for reasons of national interest. Title II: Assistance to Support Democracy in Vietnam - (Sec. 201) Authorizes the President to provide assistance through nongovernmental organizations and the Human Rights Defenders Fund for the support of individuals and organizations to promote human rights in Vietnam.
