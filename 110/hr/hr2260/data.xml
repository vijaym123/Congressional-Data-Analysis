  <summary>5/10/2007--Introduced.
Healthcare Truth and Transparency Act of 2007 - Prohibits any person who is a licensed health care service provider but who is not a medical doctor or a doctor of osteopathic medicine from making any statement or engaging in any act that deceives or misleads the public or a prospective or current patient into believing that such person is a doctor or has the same or equivalent education, skills, or training. Requires any such person to identify in any advertisement the license under which such person is authorized to provide services. Treats such statements or acts as unfair or deceptive acts or practices prescribed under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to conduct an investigation of health care providers engaging in such acts to: (1) identify specific acts and practices constituting a violation of this Act; (2) determine the frequency of such acts and practices; (3) identify instances of harm or injury resulting from such acts and practices; (4) determine the extent to which such providers comply with state laws or regulations requiring disclosure of the type of license to patients or in advertisements; and (5) identify instances where any state public policy has permitted such acts and practices.</summary>
