(Sec. 102) Provides for the assessment of civil penalties against any company that misrepresents itself as a small business owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans for purposes of federal contracting preferences.

Title IV: Strengthening Community Development - (Sec. 401) Requires: (1) an on-site SBA inspection of HUBZone-approved companies before the award of a second contract based on a HUBZone contracting preference; and (2) the SBA to develop procedures to ensure that HUBZone companies notify the SBA prior to their award of a HUBZone contract subject to an inspection. (Sec. 402) Prohibits a small business from obtaining a construction contract under the HUBZone program unless the construction project is located in or near the HUBZone in which the small business has its principal place of business.

States that once a company has been approved into the program, such approval will last throughout the program term. (Sec. 502) Extends to ten years, with a six-year developmental phase and a four-year transitional phase, the 8(a) program term.

(Sec. 504) Directs the Administrator to: (1) study changes required to provide greater federal contracting assistance to 8(a) program participants that have less equity in their business than other program participants; and (2) report study results to the small business committees. (Sec. 505) Requires the Administrator to: (1) examine the list of groups the members of which are presumed to be socially disadvantaged for purposes of the 8(a) program; (2) consider whether the list should be updated to include additional groups; and (3) report results to Congress.
