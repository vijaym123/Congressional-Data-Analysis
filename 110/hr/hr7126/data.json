    "text": "Housing Options Made Effective Act or the HOME Act - Requires the mortgagee of a residential mortgage to: (1) file a specified notice of default before foreclosure; and (2) make direct contact with, or exercise due diligence to contact, the borrower to provide foreclosure avoidance options. Prescribes loan modification and workout plan duties for loan servicers. Requires that timely payments made under a loan modification or workout plan be reported to the appropriate consumer reporting agency and included in the borrower's consumer file and consumer report. Requires a covered residential mortgage agreement to grant the borrower and the mortgagee the right to negotiate a loan modification or workout plan if: (1) the mortgage is in payment default or payment default is reasonably foreseeable; or (2) the mortgagee's anticipated recovery under a loan workout plan exceeds the anticipated recovery through foreclosure on a net present value basis. Prohibits the mortgagee from refusing partial mortgage payments. Requires the mortgagee to credit such partial payments to the borrower's account . States that mortgagee acceptance of partial payments does not affect determination of mortgage default. Sets forth the rights of renters in a property foreclosure, including a tenant right to occupy the property under a lease entered into prior to foreclosure. Requires a mortgagee, where a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure has been initiated, to file a notice of sale in a public filing or recordation office before the foreclosure sale."
