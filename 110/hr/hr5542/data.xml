  <summary>3/6/2008--Introduced.
Preserving Access to Hospice (PATH) Act of 2008 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to provide for a temporary moratorium, from November 1, 2005, through October 31, 2008, on enforcement of the hospice cap amount. Directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to study and report on: (1) the resource effectiveness and quality of hospice care as a substitute benefit for other acute care alternatives under Medicare; (2) the optimal median and average length of stay in hospice care under Medicare; (3) the reasons for persistently low median and average length of such stays; and (4) the desirability of requiring a national coverage determination of eligibility for hospice care under Medicare.</summary>
