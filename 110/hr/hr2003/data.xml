  <summary>10/2/2007--Passed House amended.
Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007 - (Sec. 2) States that is U.S. policy to: (1) support human rights, democracy, independence of the judiciary, freedom of the press, peacekeeping capacity building, and economic development in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; (2) collaborate with Ethiopia in the Global War on Terror; (3) seek the release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Ethiopia; (4) foster stability, democracy, and economic development in the region; (5) support humanitarian assistance efforts, especially in the Ogaden region; and (6) strengthen U.S.-Ethiopian relations. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of State to take specified actions to support human rights and democratization in Ethiopia. (Sec. 5) Prohibits until the President makes specified congressional certifications: (1) security assistance to Ethiopia, with exceptions for peacekeeping, military education and training for civilian personnel, or counter-terrorism assistance; and (2) U.S. entry of any Ethiopian official involved in giving orders to use lethal force against peaceful demonstrators or accused of gross human rights violations, and government security personnel involved in specified shootings of demonstrators or prisoners, or murdering Etenesh Yemam. Authorizes the President, after congressional notification, to waive such prohibitions for national security purposes. Directs the President, the Secretary, and other relevant U.S. government officials to call upon the government of Ethiopia to: (1) release all remaining political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, especially prisoners held without charge; and (2) allow full access to the Ogaden region by humanitarian aid organizations and international human rights investigators. Directs the President to provide assistance for the rehabilitation of Ethiopian torture victims. Expresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. government should: (1) encourage the government of Ethiopia to enter into discussions with peaceful political groups to bring them into full participation in Ethiopia's political and economic affairs; and (2) provide necessary assistance to help achieve such goal. (Sec. 6) Directs the President to provide Ethiopia with assistance to: (1) develop Ethiopia's Nile and Awash River resources, including assistance for the construction of irrigation systems and hydroelectric power that might prevent future famine; and (2) support hospitals, clinics, and health care centers, especially in rural areas. (Sec. 7) Directs the President to report to Congress respecting implementation of this Act. (Sec. 8) Authorizes FY2008-FY2009 appropriations.</summary>
