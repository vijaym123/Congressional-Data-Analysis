Captive Primate Safety Act - Amends the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to add nonhuman primates (i.e., monkeys, great apes, lemurs, etc.) to the definition of "prohibited wildlife species" for purposes of the prohibition against the sale or purchase of such species in interstate or foreign commerce. Makes it unlawful for a person to sell or purchase a live animal of any prohibited wildlife species in interstate or foreign commerce (i.e., for pet trade purposes). Sets forth: (1) exceptions to such prohibition; and (2) civil and criminal penalties for violations of the requirements of this Act.Requires the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other relevant federal and state agencies, to issue regulations to implement the Captive Wildlife Safety Act.Authorizes additional appropriations to the Secretary for FY2009 to hire additional law enforcement personnel of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to enforce the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981.</summary>
