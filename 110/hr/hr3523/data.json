Requires grantees to contract with an independent research and evaluation firm to evaluate the effectiveness of their School Leadership Initiatives in recruiting, training, and retraining school leaders and improving student achievement. Directs the Secretary to award an additional grant to partnership grantees whose model School Leadership Initiatives are evaluated as effective so that they can implement such Initiatives in other LEAs within their states."
