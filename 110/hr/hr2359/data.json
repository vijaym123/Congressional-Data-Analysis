Title II: Grant Initiatives - (Sec. 201) Allows a lead SBDC to apply for an additional grant to carry out: (1) a capital access initiative program; (2) a disaster recovery program; (3) an innovation and competitiveness services to manufacturers initiative program; (4) a mature entrepreneurs assistance program; or (5) a small business sustainability initiative program. Outlines elements, and provides minimum and maximum grant amounts, under each program.

Provides a minimum grant amount of $200,000.

(Sec. 207) Directs the Administrator to establish a program to provide regulatory compliance assistance to small businesses through selected SBDCs, the Association of Small Business Development Centers, and federal compliance partnership programs. Requires quarterly reports from participating SBDCs summarizing assistance provided. Requires the Administrator, in carrying out such program, to: (1) act as the repository of and clearinghouse for data and information submitted by participating SBDCs; and (2) report annually to the President and the congressional small business committees on assistance provided. Directs the: (1) Administrator to submit to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA a list of regulations considered burdensome for small businesses; (2) Chief Counsel to review such regulations and identify those eligible for review by the appropriate federal rulemaking agency; and (3) Chief Counsel to annually publish a list of regulations determined eligible for review, and the results of such review. Allows only certified SBDCs to participate in the regulatory compliance assistance program, with a waiver if the Administrator determines that the SBDC is making a good faith effort to obtain such certification. Requires the Administrator to select for program participation the SBDC programs of two states from each of ten regional groups of states. Authorizes the Administrator to make additional SBDC program selections. Provides a minimum grant amount of $200,000. Requires the Comptroller General to evaluate the program, and to report evaluation results to the Administrator and the small business committees.
