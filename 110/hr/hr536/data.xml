  <summary>1/17/2007--Introduced.
Helping America Hear Act of 2007 - Requires each federal employee health benefits plan to provide coverage for at least two hearing aids every three years, except that such plan need not cover more than $2,500 for hearing aids for any individual in any three-year period. Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require a group health plan that provides hospital and surgical benefits to also provide such hearing aid coverage. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require health insurance offered in the individual market to provide such coverage.</summary>
