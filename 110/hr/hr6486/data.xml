  <summary>7/14/2008--Introduced.
Drug Testing Integrity Act of 2008 - Makes it unlawful to knowingly manufacture, market, sell, ship, or otherwise provide to another individual any product with the intent to assist such individual to use such product to defraud a drug test. Defines "defraud a drug test" to mean to: (1) submit a substance that purports to be from an individual other than its actual source, or purports to have been excreted or collected other than when it was actually excreted or collected; or (2) engage in any other conduct with the intent to produce a false or misleading outcome of a test for the presence of a controlled substance. Grants the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement powers as a violation of an unfair or deceptive act or practice.</summary>
