Limits the amount of loans that may be guaranteed at any one time to no more than $100 million. Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) the terms of obligations; (2) payments by the Secretary to the holders of the obligation for the borrower; and (3) actions by the Attorney General to recover unpaid principal and interest from a defaulting borrower."
