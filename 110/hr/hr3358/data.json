Instructs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), when it decides whether to permit construction or operation of a nuclear reactor, to deem without further consideration that sufficient capacity will be available in a timely manner to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste resulting from the operation of the reactor and related facilities."
