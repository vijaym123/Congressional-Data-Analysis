  <summary>11/15/2007--Introduced.
Amends the Small Business Act relating to the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program (a program under which a portion of a federal agency's research or research and development funds are reserved for award to small businesses) to require certain program directives issued for the general conduct of SBIR programs within the federal government to provide, among other things, that an agency may increase to specified levels amounts awarded in the first and second phases of the SBIR Program. Requires such amounts be adjusted once every five years to reflect economic adjustments and programmatic considerations.</summary>
