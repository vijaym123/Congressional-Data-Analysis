Farm Programs Payment Limitation Integrity Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations to establish measurable standards to prevent the use of separate entities to exceed commodity payment limitations and to provide payments only to active farmers. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to provide that if the Secretary determines that a person has committed fraud in connection with the adoption of a scheme or device to evade payment limitations such person shall be ineligible for farm program payments in the crop year for which the scheme or device was adopted and the succeeding five crop years.</summary>
