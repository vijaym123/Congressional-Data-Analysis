Requires program mentors to be women who: (1) have received at least a baccalaureate degree from an institution of higher education; (2) are mentoring no more than two program mentees; and (3) are trained and screened to encourage mentees to engage in responsible, goal-orientated behavior, delay their sexual activity, and increase their participation in school. Authorizes the Secretary to provide student loan forgiveness, under the Federal Family Education Loan, Direct Loan, or Perkins Loan programs of the Higher Education Act of 1965, to program mentors who serve for at least 200 hours in an academic year."
