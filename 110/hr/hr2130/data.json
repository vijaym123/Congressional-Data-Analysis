Sets forth guidelines for such study, including: (1) an identification of the transactions to which such fee would apply; (2) exclusions from such fee; (3) the rate of such fee; (4) potential uses for revenue from such fee; (5) progressivity standards; and (6) general matters, including point of liability for such fee and responsibility for collection. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the results of such study within one year after the enactment of this Act with a comprehensive analysis of various aspects of the transaction fee, including revenue generation, impact on the national economy, and implementation."
