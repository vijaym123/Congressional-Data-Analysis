Requires mentor teachers to have at least five years of teaching experience at a school in the high-need LEA and a master's degree in education or teaching. Requires program participants to attain full state teaching certification prior to completing the program and accept placement for at least five academic years thereafter in a school chosen by the high-need LEA."
