Directs the Section to give priority in awarding grants and providing services to prosecutor's offices in states with an average of at least 100 murders per year or with a violent crime rate above the national average.Authorizes: (1) the Attorney General to make grants to state and local prosecutors and to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia for providing such witness protection; and (2) each recipient to use the grant to provide witness protection or to credit the grant to the Section to cover the Section's costs of providing witness protection.
