Directs the Secretary of Defense to transfer a parcel of land, consisting of approximately five acres, within the proposed boundary on the map entitled \"Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial, Proposed Boundary,\" dated August 2005, to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior if: (1) the land is excess to military needs; and (2) all environmental remediation actions necessary to respond to environmental contamination related to the land have been completed in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 and other applicable laws. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into an agreement with the city of Concord, California, and the East Bay Regional Park District to establish and operate a facility for visitor orientation and parking, administrative offices, and curatorial storage for the Memorial. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense, in order to facilitate the land transfer under this Act, should promptly remediate remaining environmental contamination related to the land. Expresses the sense of Congress that, in order to preserve the Memorial for future generations, the Secretaries of Defense and the Interior should work together to: (1) repair storm damage to the Port Chicago site; and (2) develop a process by which future repairs and necessary modifications to the site can be achieved in as timely and cost-effective a manner as possible."
