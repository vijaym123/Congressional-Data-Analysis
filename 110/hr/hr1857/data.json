Requires state authorization of the program's operation before any federal officer, employee, or authority may enforce any program requirement against a state authority, and before any state authority may be obliged to obey any such requirement. Prohibits the Secretary from providing any funds under an ESEA program to a local governmental entity unless the state's chief law enforcement officer certifies that the entity's participation in the program is consistent with any applicable state law requirements."
