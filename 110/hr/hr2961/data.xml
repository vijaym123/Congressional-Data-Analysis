Expands the boundaries of the Walkill National Wildlife Refuge located in Sussex County, New Jersey, to include the Mt. Laurel property-added lands (including any water and interest in such lands).

Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for the acquisition of such lands. Requires any land, water, or interest acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this Act to become part of the Refuge.</summary>
