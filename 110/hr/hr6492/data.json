Defines \"deferred prosecution agreement\" as an agreement between a federal prosecutor and an organization to conditionally defer criminal prosecution of that organization. Defines \"nonprosecution agreement\" as an agreement between a federal prosecutor and an organization to conditionally decide not to file criminal charges against the organization. Requires a deferred prosecution agreement to be filed in an appropriate U.S. district court. Requires such court to approve an agreement if it is consistent with the guidelines for such agreements and is in the interests of justice."
