Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a demonstration project to evaluate new approaches to coding and payment under the Medicare program for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests; and (2) appoint a standing panel to determine tests to be included in the project and make recommendations derived from project results to the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
