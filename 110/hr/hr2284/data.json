Defines an \"eligible state\" as a state that has a combined population of Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians that comprises at least 1% of the state's total population. Prohibits any applicant from receiving more than $300,000 in such grants for one fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations for carrying out such additional assistance for FY2008-FY2010. Requires a Small Business Development Center receiving such a grant to request the advice of the local tribal organization on how best to provide assistance and where to locate satellite centers to provide such assistance."
