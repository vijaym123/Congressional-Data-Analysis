Requires the program to be designed to maximize the utilization of produced water in the United States by increasing its quality and reducing its environmental impacts.Requires that the program address: (1) produced water recovery, including research for desalination and demineralization to reduce total dissolved solids in the produced water; (2) re-injection of produced water into subsurface geological formations to increase energy production; and (3) improving safety and minimizing environmental impacts of such activities.Requires the Secretary, through the appropriate National Laboratory, to carry out research, development, and demonstration activities that are complementary to and supportive of such program.Authorizes appropriations."
