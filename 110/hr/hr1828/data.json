Provides for scholarships: (1) under the Teaching program for high school seniors and second-year college students to encourage them to enter the teaching field and become career educators; and (2) under the Partnership program for individuals, such as paraprofessional educational personnel and others currently in the education field, to complete a bachelor's degree with a state license or certification to teach through partnerships among associate- and bachelor-degree-granting institutions. Requires scholarship recipients to repay specified amounts if they do not fulfill certain obligations to teach in their state's public elementary or secondary schools, under such Teaching and Partnership Fellows program."
