  <summary>7/31/2008--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in determining the amount of any allowance or reimbursement to be paid under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) veterans beneficiary travel program, to use the mileage reimbursement rates for the use of privately owned vehicles by government employees traveling on official business. Authorizes the Secretary to use a rate in excess of such rate. Prohibits the Secretary from making payments for travel performed by a special mode unless it is: (1) medically required and previously authorized; or (2) in connection with a medical emergency of such a nature that delay would have been hazardous to the person's life or health. Eliminates required deductions in connection with travel under the program. Allows such payments in connection with all veterans and family members eligible for examination, treatment, care, rehabilitation, or counseling through the VA.</summary>
