  <summary>4/19/2007--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an Indian tribal government, in the case of a facility that uses a renewable energy resource to produce electricity in which such government has an ownership interest in the gross sales from such facility, to assign to any other person who has such an ownership interest in such facility any portion of the production from the facility that would, but for this Act, be allocated to such government for purposes of the renewable electricity production credit. Makes such amendment applicable to electricity produced and sold after December 31, 2006.</summary>
