Allows the Secretary to guarantee up to 80% of the loan amount for loans exceeding $10 million for projects for the construction of such infrastructure. Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) under which NAS shall evaluate, every three years, such development. Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to enter into an agreement with NAS to study the successes of international partnerships among governments, industry, and academia in advancing the capabilities of science and technology in conjunction with a corresponding increase in business opportunities."
