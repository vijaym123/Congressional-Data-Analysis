    "text": "Securing Exports Through Coordination and Technology Act - Amends the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 to revise filing requirements under the Automated Export System (AES). Requires carriers obliged to file Shipper's Export Declarations to file them through AES (either directly or through intermediaries) before items are exported from any U.S. port, unless the Secretary of Commerce grants an exception. (Under current law such a filing may be made after departure of the carrier from the port or place of exportation or transportation.) Defines \"intermediary\" as a freight forwarder, a non-vessel operating common carrier, or an ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission) Carnet and its service providers. Sets forth requirements regarding: (1) the confidentiality and the sharing of Shipper's Export Declarations with the public and government agencies; and (2) conferences and seminars to educate exporters about U.S. export laws and the AES. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) grant licenses to persons to file information in the AES; and (2) deny, suspend, or revoke a license. Provides for administrative and judicial appeal of license denials, suspensions, or revocations. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations to ensure that the AES will not accept filings with respect to exports that would violate U.S. export control laws or trade sanctions regulations."
