Requires implementation of\u00a0such systems by\u00a0December 31, 2012, in areas that have the highest safety risk due to shared track between commuter and freight rail. Increases penalties for violations of rail safety regulations or orders issued by the Secretary, including violations related to rail accident reporting and hours-of-service."
