Revises group eligibility requirements for TAA to cover: (1) a shift, by a public agency to a foreign country, of production of articles or in provision of services, like or directly competitive with articles which are produced, or services which are provided by the workers' firm, subdivision, or public agency; and (2) instances where the workers' firm, subdivision, or public agency obtains or is likely to obtain such services from a foreign country. Provides for industry-wide certification of adversely affected workers for TAA. Increases the amount of payments for training of adversely affected workers under the Act. TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act of 2007 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the tax credit for the health insurance costs of certain TAA workers and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) pension recipients. Sets forth requirements to prevent a lapse of health care coverage for TAA workers and their families. Replaces alternative trade adjustment assistance for older workers provisions with eligibility requirements for wage insurance benefits to older workers who have received an industry-wide certification to apply for TAA. Increases the maximum allowance to cover costs of an adversely affected worker for job search expenses and relocation expenses. Establishes an Office of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Ombudsman. Extends the TAA program for workers through FY2012. Revises the TAA program for communities negatively impacted by trade. Establishes a TAA for communities program to coordinate the federal response. Allows the filing of a petition with the Secretary of Commerce for certification of eligibility to apply for TAA by a service sector firm. Extends the TAA program for firms through FY2012.
