Healthy Americans Act - Requires each adult individual to have the opportunity to purchase a Healthy Americans Private Insurance Plan (HAPI).

Sets forth penalties for failure to enroll. Establishes standardized coverage and state options for HAPI plans. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate guidelines concerning the benefits, items, and services to be covered. Sets forth requirements for setting premiums. Requires the Secretary to establish the Healthy America Advisory Committee to provide annual recommendations concerning modifications to the benefits, items, and services required. Requires the Secretary to establish Chronic Care Education Centers. Requires states to establish or designate a state Health Help Agency to carry out the administration of HAPI plans and to promote prevention and wellness for residents. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require employers and individuals to each make shared responsibility payments for HAPI plan premiums. Sets forth requirements for health insurance issuers offering a HAPI plan. Establishes the Healthy Americans Public Health Trust Fund for the payment of premium subsidies. Terminates federal health benefits coverage, including coverage provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program and the State Children's Health Insurance program (SCHIP).
