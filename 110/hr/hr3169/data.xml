  <summary>7/24/2007--Introduced.
Disaster Voting Reform Act of 2007 - Directs the Election Assistance Commission to make grants to each eligible state to: (1) restore and replace supplies, materials, and equipment used in the administration of elections which were damaged as a result of a major natural disaster; and (2) conduct voter outreach and education for voters displaced as a result of a major natural disaster. Requires preference for states with satellite voting sites. Grants an eligible disaster evacuee the right to be treated in the same manner as an absent uniform services voter and overseas voter under the Uniform and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act. Deems such an individual entitled to vote by absentee ballot under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002. Requires each motor vehicle authority and each designated voter registration agency in a state to take necessary steps to notify individuals to whom services are provided of the protections of this Act and the requirements for obtaining those protections.</summary>
