  <summary>6/9/2008--Passed House amended.
Congressional Review Act Improvement Act - Repeals the requirement that federal agencies must submit rules (and related reports) that are published in the Federal Register to both Houses of Congress before such rules can take effect (thus making the Comptroller General the sole recipient of such rules).Requires the Comptroller General to submit to each House of Congress a weekly report containing a list of the rules received by the Comptroller General, including a notation indicating whether or not a rule is a major rule. Requires the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate to publish in the Congressional Record each report received from the Comptroller General and a statement of referral to the committee or committees responsible for the review of the rules in each such report.</summary>
