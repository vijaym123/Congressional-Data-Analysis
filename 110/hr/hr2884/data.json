Directs the Secretary to inform military naturalization applicants of their choice to provide new fingerprints if such submission would result in more timely and effective naturalization adjudication. Provides for cooperation between the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense to determine an appropriate fingerprint format. Directs the Secretary to update Department of Homeland Security (DHS) websites within 30 days of any change in naturalization law or regulation affecting members of the Armed Forces. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) report to the congressional defense and judiciary committees on the naturalization application process for members of the Armed Forces; and (2) conduct a study of this Act's implementation by the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense."
