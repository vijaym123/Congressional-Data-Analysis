  <summary>11/6/2007--Passed House amended.
Kendell Frederick Citizenship Assistance Act - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to use the fingerprints provided by an individual at the time of military enlistment to satisfy any naturalization fingerprint requirements if: (1) the individual may be naturalized under the Immigration and Nationality Act; (2) the individual was fingerprinted in accordance with Department of Defense (DOD) requirements; (3) the individual submits a naturalization application within 24 months of enlistment; and (4) the Secretary determines that the fingerprints are sufficient to adjudicate the naturalization application. Directs the Secretary to inform military naturalization applicants of their choice to provide new fingerprints if such submission would result in more timely and effective naturalization adjudication. Provides for cooperation between the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense to determine an appropriate fingerprint format. Directs the Secretary to update Department of Homeland Security (DHS) websites within 30 days of any change in naturalization law or regulation affecting members of the Armed Forces. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) report to the congressional defense and judiciary committees on the naturalization application process for members of the Armed Forces; and (2) conduct a study of this Act's implementation by the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense.</summary>
