Conditions such loan guarantee upon reasonable assurances by the borrower that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in the performance of construction work financed in whole or in part with the loan will be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on similar work in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor. Prohibits any appropriation authorized pursuant to the Act from excluding any category of specified eligible projects."
