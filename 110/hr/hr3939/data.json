Requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to initiate a rulemaking to: (1) require pilots of aircraft providing emergency medical service to use a standardized checklist of risk evaluation factors to determine whether a mission should be accepted; (2) establish performance based flight dispatch procedures for such pilots; and (3) require, after a certain feasibility study is done, flight data and cockpit voice recorders on board such aircraft."
