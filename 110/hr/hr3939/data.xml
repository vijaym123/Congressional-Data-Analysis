  <summary>10/23/2007--Introduced.
Requires a pilot of an aircraft providing emergency medical services to comply with federal crewmember flight time and duty period and rest requirements whenever there is a medical crew on board, without regard to whether there are patients on board. Requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to initiate a rulemaking to: (1) require pilots of aircraft providing emergency medical service to use a standardized checklist of risk evaluation factors to determine whether a mission should be accepted; (2) establish performance based flight dispatch procedures for such pilots; and (3) require, after a certain feasibility study is done, flight data and cockpit voice recorders on board such aircraft.</summary>
