Amends federal postal law to make cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and roll-your-own-tobacco nonmailable. Requires tobacco products attempted to be mailed to be disposed of as the Postal Service directs. Provides a civil penalty for each mailing violation. Authorizes the Postal Service, on evidence satisfactory to the Postal Service that any person is, for commercial or moneymaking purposes, engaged in the sending of such matter, to: (1) refuse to accept any mailing from that person or his representative unless the person or his representative establishes to the satisfaction of the postmaster that the mailing does not contain such matter; and (2) order the person to cease and desist from mailing such matter. Authorizes civil actions by states to: (1) enjoin mailings to residents of that state; (2) impose civil penalties; or (3) obtain other relief.</summary>
