  <summary>8/3/2007--Reported to House amended.
Solar Energy Research and Advancement Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a research and development program to provide lower cost and more viable thermal energy storage technologies to enable the shifting of electric power loads on demand and extend the operating time of concentrating solar power electric generating plants. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2012. Instructs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on methods to: (1) integrate concentrating solar power into regional electricity transmission systems, identifying new transmission or transmission upgrades needed to bring electricity from high concentrating solar power resource areas to growing electric power load centers throughout the United States; and (2) reduce the amount of water consumed by concentrating solar power systems. Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a competitive grant program in the Office of Solar Energy Technologies to create and strengthen solar industry workforce training and internship programs in installation, operation, and maintenance of solar energy products; (2) a research and development program to assist in demonstration and commercial application of direct solar renewable energy sources to provide alternatives to traditional power generation for lighting and illumination, including light pipe technology; (3) a research, development, and demonstration program to promote less costly and more reliable decentralized distributed solar-powered air conditioning for individuals and businesses; and (4) a program of grants to states to demonstrate advanced photovoltaic technology. Authorizes appropriations for all these programs for FY2008-FY2012.</summary>
