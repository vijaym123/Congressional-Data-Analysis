Recognizes that each state has authority to protect the lives of unborn children residing in the jurisdiction of that state . Amends the federal judicial code to remove Supreme Court and district court jurisdiction to review cases arising out of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or practice, or any act interpreting such a measure, on the grounds that such measure: (1) protects the rights of human persons between conception and birth; or (2) prohibits, limits, or regulates the performance of abortions or the provision of public funds, facilities, personnel, or other assistance for abortions. Makes federal court decisions not binding precedent on the courts of any state or their subdivisions, the District of Columbia, or any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States or their subdivisions. Makes this Act applicable to any case pending on the date of enactment."
