Child Care Public-Private Partnership Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a business-incentive grant program to provide child care through public-private partnerships. Provides program grants to cover up to one-third of the costs for: (1) businesses or consortia to start up, or provide additional, employee child care services; and (2) nonprofit business organizations to provide technical information and assistance to enable businesses to provide such services. Requires such services to: (1) be provided equitably and affordably to low- and moderate-income employees; and (2) comply with state and local licensing requirements. Gives priority in grant selection to businesses with fewer than 100 full-time employees.</summary>
