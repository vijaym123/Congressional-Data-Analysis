Office of Men's Health Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the Office of Men's Health within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Office, to collaborate with relevant federal agencies and offices to identify and report on men's health data, including health disparities for chronic diseases and health conditions related to men of color. Requires the Secretary to make grants to institutions of higher education to: (1) conduct conferences on men's health; (2) conduct public education campaigns to reduce health disparities relating to men's health; (3) evaluate the effectiveness of resources that focus on men's health; and (4) report on the gaps and problems that men of color have in utilizing health resources. Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on men's health that includes information on racial and ethnic minority men and their health disparities. Requires the agreement to provide for the establishment of a panel of independent experts to assist in the conduct of the study by reviewing and providing guidance on appropriate outcomes and assessments for men's health and health disparities of men of color. Requires the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to include an analysis of available data on racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities in men's health in the annual report to Congress on health disparities.</summary>
