  <summary>11/9/2007--Introduced.
STEM Promotion Act of 2007 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to contract with successful advertising firms to implement a campaign to expand the population of qualified individuals in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields by encouraging young Americans to enter those fields. Requires that such a campaign be designed to: (1) enhance the image of education and professions in the STEM fields and promote participation in such fields; (2) hold as a high priority making specific appeals to Latinos, Native Americans, African-Americans, and women in order to increase their numbers in STEM fields; and (3) include a narrowly focused effort to attract current professionals in STEM fields into teaching in elementary and secondary schools.</summary>
