  <summary>7/31/2008--Introduced.
E-fencing Enforcement Act of 2008 - Amends the federal criminal code to impose a duty on any online market provider to disclose the contact information (i.e., name, telephone number, and address for service of legal process) of any high volume seller who has listed goods or items for sale on such provider's online marketplace that match the description of stolen goods listed in a signed report from a criminal law enforcement agency. Defines "high volume seller" as any person who, through an online marketplace, sells or offers for sale in a single offering goods or items worth more than $5,000, or more than $12,000 in one or more offerings during the preceding 365 days. Requires an online market provider to: (1) retain contact information on high volume sellers for three years; and (2) deny high volume sellers access to the marketplace if such provider has good reason to believe that such sellers acquired their goods unlawfully. Allows high volume sellers to bring a civil action to challenge the denial of access to an online marketplace.</summary>
