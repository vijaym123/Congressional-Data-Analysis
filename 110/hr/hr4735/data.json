States that any successor in interest in such property pursuant to the foreclosure shall assume that interest subject to: (1) provision of a 90-day notice to vacate to any bona fide tenant of such property; (2) the rights of such a tenant either to continue occupancy until the end of a preexisting lease, or until the end of the six-month period beginning on the date of the notice of foreclosure, whichever occurs first; and (3) the right of such a tenant to the 90-day notice to vacate, if the tenant has no lease or has a lease terminable at will under state law."
