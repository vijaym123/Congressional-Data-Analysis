    "text": "QI Program Supplemental Funding Act of 2008 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, to provide supplemental funding for the qualifying individual (QI) program. Requires a state to have in operation, in mechanized Medicaid claims processing and information retrieval systems, an eligibility determination system which provides for data matching through the Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS) facilitated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including matching with medical assistance programs operated by other states. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make sponsors of certain antibiotic drugs eligible for a three-year or a five-year market exclusivity if a marketing application is submitted for an antibiotic drug that: (1) was approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services before November 21, 1997; or (2) was the subject of one or more applications received by the Secretary before November 21, 1997, none of which was approved. Authorizes the use of Medicaid integrity program funds for transportation and travel expenses for attendees at education, training, or consultative activities. Increases FY2014 funding for the Medicare Improvement Fund."
