  <summary>10/8/2008--Public Law.
Federal Protective Service Guard Contracting Reform Act of 2008 - Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Assistant Secretary of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to promulgate regulations establishing guidelines for the prohibition of contract awards for the provision of guard services under the contract security guard program of the Federal Protective Service to any business concern that is owned, controlled, or operated by an individual who has been convicted of a felony. Authorizes the Secretary to consider permanent or interim prohibitions when promulgating the regulations.Requires such regulations to: (1) identify which serious felonies may prohibit a contractor from being awarded a contract; (2) require contractors to provide information regarding any relevant felony convictions when submitting bids or proposals; (3) provide guidelines for the contracting officer to assess present responsibility, mitigating factors, and the risk associated with the previous conviction and to award a contract under certain circumstances.Requires the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to report on establishing similar guidelines government-wide to the House Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.</summary>
