Authorizes the Secretary to consider permanent or interim prohibitions when promulgating the regulations.Requires such regulations to: (1) identify which serious felonies may prohibit a contractor from being awarded a contract; (2) require contractors to provide information regarding any relevant felony convictions when submitting bids or proposals; (3) provide guidelines for the contracting officer to assess present responsibility, mitigating factors, and the risk associated with the previous conviction and to award a contract under certain circumstances.Requires the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to report on establishing similar guidelines government-wide to the House Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform."
