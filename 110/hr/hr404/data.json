Requires customer service standards to take into account: (1) existing agency standards; (2) information collected from agency customers; and (3) approaches for government-wide citizen contact actions described in the Citizens Service Levels Interagency Committee Report by the General Services Administration (GSA) or any subsequent report. Requires the Director to: (1) prescribe guidance governing the implementation or updating of customer service standards and performance measures of agencies using such best practices and any specific customer service related principles applicable to individual agencies; and (2) issue an annual report on the success of agencies in meeting the standards for each of the five years after the date of enactment. Requires each agency to: (1) implement standards and performance measures required by this Act; (2) submit information OMB may require on its customer service in relation to such standards and measures; and (3) ensure that standards are continuously improved and that appropriate contact information regarding customer service inquiries is available. Requires the standards to be publicly available on the website of each agency. Directs the Comptroller General to report to specified congressional committees on: (1) whether agencies are implementing the customer service standards; (2) whether there is an increase in overall quality in customer service; and (3) recommendations to improve performance measures and standards for customer service. Authorizes the report to be used by Congress and the Director to update performance measures for customer service. Authorizes the head of a federal agency to establish a program to pay cash awards to employees for demonstrated excellence in customer service."
