    "text": "Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 - Amends the Head Start Act (the Act) to revise and reauthorize Head Start programs. (Sec. 2) Includes among the aims of Head Start programs children's growth in language, literacy, mathematics, science, social and emotional functioning, creative arts, physical skills, and approaches to learning. (Sec. 3) Includes community-based organizations and financial literacy training within the definitions of Head Start delegate agencies and family literacy services, respectively. Adds definitions of Head Start deficiencies, homeless children, institutions of higher education, interrater reliability, limited English proficient (LEP) children, principles of scientific research, professional development for teachers and staff, scientifically valid research, and unresolved areas of noncompliance. Removes Micronesia and the Marshall Islands from the list of program participants. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to provide financial assistance to Head Start agencies for five-year periods. (Sec. 5) Authorizes appropriations for Head Start programs for FY2008-FY2012. (Sec. 6) Sets forth allotment requirements, as well as limitations on and authorized uses of Head Start funds. Reserves from such funds: (1) amounts for state, Indian, migrant and seasonal, and territorial Head Start programs that are equal to the base amounts such programs received for the prior fiscal year; (2) amounts for collaborative grants at the FY2007 level; (3) at least 2.5% and no more than 3% for training and technical assistance, at least 20% of which is to be used to provide such assistance to Early Head Start programs; and (4) specified monetary amounts for research, demonstration, and evaluation activities and for discretionary payments. Requires the use of remaining funds for cost of living increases for each Head Start agency and the provision of specified amounts to Indian and migrant and seasonal Head Start programs to increase enrollment. Requires that after at least 20% of of the training and technical assistance funds are reserved for Early Head Start programs: (1) at least 50% of such remaining funds be available for the direct use of Head Start agencies; (2) at least 25% be available to the Secretary for state-based or national training and technical assistance systems; and (3) the remainder be available to the Secretary to assist local Early Head Start entities meet and exceed program performance standards. Requires any additional remaining funds to be used for specified Head Start quality improvement and expansion activities. Provides funding for the Republic of Palau through FY2009 and, if legislation approving a new agreement regarding assistance to Palau is not enacted by the end of FY2009, through FY2012. Directs the Secretary to establish policies and procedures assuring that: (1) by FY2009 at least 10% of the children enrolled by each Head Start and delegate agency will be disabled children eligible for special education or early intervention services; and (2) such agencies will collaborate with state and local agencies providing such services. Applies service delivery guidelines to: (1) models that leverage the capacity and capabilities of the delivery system of early childhood education and development services or programs; and (2) procedures to provide for the conversion of part-day programs to full-day programs or part-day slots to full-day slots and serve additional infants and toddlers. Provides that, when Head Start appropriations are less than the prior fiscal year's appropriations or not sufficient to maintain services comparable to that prior year's services, Head Start grantees may negotiate a reduced funded enrollment level with the Secretary without a reduction in their grant level, if they can show that a reduced enrollment level is necessary to maintain the quality of services. Requires regulations to ensure appropriate supervision and background checks of individuals with whom Head Start agencies contract to transport children. Requires the Secretary to: (1) appoint a national migrant and seasonal Head Start collaboration director and a national Indian Head Start collaboration director; (2) conduct annual consultations in each affected Head Start region with tribal governments operating Head Start or Early Head Start programs to better gauge their needs; and (3) establish policies and procedures to remove barriers to the enrollment and participation of homeless children in Head Start programs. (Sec. 7) Provides for the development of a new system for designating Head Start agencies and the consideration of additional criteria in evaluating applicants.
