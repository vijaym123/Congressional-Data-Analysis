Canine Detection Team Improvement Act of 2007 - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) fully coordinate Department of Homeland Security (DHS) canine training programs; (2) ensure that DHS is maximizing its use of existing training facilities and resources to train canines throughout the year; (3) make it a priority to increase the number of domestically bred canines used by DHS to assist its counterterrorism mission; (4) increase the utilization of domestically bred canines from universities and private and nonprofit sources; and (5) consult with other federal, state, and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, universities, and private entities that use detection canines, as well as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to encourage domestic breeding of canines and to consolidate canine procurement across the federal government. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a competitive grant program for domestic breeders of canines; (2) establish a Homeland Security Canine Detection Accreditation Board; and (3) prohibit the use of grant funds to acquire a canine detection team that is not certified, except under special circumstances.</summary>
