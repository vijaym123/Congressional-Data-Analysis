Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a competitive grant program for domestic breeders of canines; (2) establish a Homeland Security Canine Detection Accreditation Board; and (3) prohibit the use of grant funds to acquire a canine detection team that is not certified, except under special circumstances."
