(Sec. 103) Requires: (1) the Administrator to maintain a disaster reserve corps of at least 1,000 individuals to perform functions related to disaster response; (2) each such individual to be appropriately trained; and (3) the Administrator to report to the small business committees with respect to the corps. (Sec. 104) Directs the Administrator to: (1) develop long-term plans to secure additional office space to accommodate an expanded workforce in times of disaster; and (2) report such plans to the small business committees. (Sec. 105) Requires the Administrator to ensure that SBA disaster programs are coordinated, to the maximum extent practicable, with the disaster assistance programs of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Requires a report from the Administrator to the small business committees concerning SBA regulations to ensure that each application for SBA disaster assistance is submitted to the SBA as quickly as practicable or directed to the appropriate agency. (Sec. 106) Establishes in the SBA an Associate Administrator for Disaster Assistance to: (1) develop and implement the SBA's plans for disaster response; and (2) direct the SBA's training exercises with respect to disasters. Establishes a Director for Disaster Lending to direct all aspects of the SBA's disaster lending program. Title II: Lending - (Sec. 201) Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) provide disaster loans to certain private nonprofit organizations with respect to a significant incident; (2) make or guarantee a mitigation loan to a small business for damage or destruction due to a significant incident; and (3) provide or make such loans for FY2006 with respect to a nonprofit or small business located, as of August 28, 2005, in an area affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Wilma. (Sec. 202) Directs the Administrator to: (1) develop, implement, and maintain a centralized information system to track communications between SBA personnel and applicants for disaster assistance; and (2) ensure that each applicant receives follow-up communications from the SBA at all critical stages of the application process. (Sec. 203) Requires the Administrator to carry out an Immediate Disaster Assistance program under which the SBA participates on a deferred basis in 85% of the balance of financing of a loan less than or equal to $25,000 for a business affected by a disaster. (Sec. 204) Authorizes the Administrator, in making disaster mitigation loans, to provide to the recipient an option to defer loan repayment for up to four years. Prohibits the Administrator from requiring repayment until 12 months after the final loan disbursement is made.

(Sec. 208) Authorizes the Administrator to carry out a program to permit banks and other financial institutions to process, approve, close, and service disaster loans for a fee of up to 2% of the total loan amount. Allows such program during any period: (1) of a significant incident; or (2) which the average time for the SBA to approve disaster loans in response to any single disaster is 30 days or more. (Sec. 209) Directs the Administrator to ensure that SBA has in place a facility for disaster loan processing that, whenever the SBA's primary processing facility becomes unavailable, is able to take over such processing within two days. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 210) Authorizes the Administrator to make grants of up to $100,000 to small businesses located in disaster areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Wilma that experienced specified housing and/or infrastructure losses, upon such businesses' certification to reestablish in the same areas.

Permits grants to be up to the amount required to be remitted by the individual. (Sec. 212) Increases from $1.5 million to $3 million the maximum disaster loan limit for individual borrowers.

(Sec. 215) Allows the $3 million maximum disaster loan limit to be waived in the case of applicants that will constitute a major source of employment due to changed economic circumstances.
