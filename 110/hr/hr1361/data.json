(Sec. 103) Requires: (1) the Administrator to maintain a disaster reserve corps of at least 1,000 individuals to perform functions related to disaster response; (2) each such individual to be appropriately trained; and (3) the Administrator to report to the small business committees with respect to the corps. (Sec. 104) Directs the Administrator to: (1) develop long-term plans to secure additional office space to accommodate an expanded workforce in times of disaster; and (2) report such plans to the small business committees.
