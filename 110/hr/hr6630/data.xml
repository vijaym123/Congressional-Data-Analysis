  <summary>9/9/2008--Passed House amended.
Directs the Secretary of Transportation to terminate, by September 6, 2008, the one-year cross-border pilot project started on September 6, 2007, as part of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) cross-border motor carrier provisions, to demonstrate the ability of Mexico-domiciled motor carriers to operate safely in the United States beyond the commercial zones along the U.S.-Mexico border. Prohibits the Secretary, unless expressly authorized by Congress, from granting authority to a motor carrier domiciled in Mexico to operate beyond U.S. municipalities and commercial zones on the United States-Mexico border after September 6, 2008.Requires certain reports to Congress, within 60 days after enactment of this Act, by: (1) the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation; (2) the independent review panel established to monitor the demonstration project; and (3) the Secretary of Transportation on the project's implementation and the participation of motor carriers.</summary>
