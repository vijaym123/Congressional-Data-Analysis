Lobbying Transparency Act of 2007 - Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to require a registered lobbyist who bundles two or more contributions made (in an aggregate amount exceeding $5,000) to a covered recipient during a quarterly period to: (1) file a quarterly report with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives; and (2) notify the covered recipient by certified mail before filing such report. Requires the notification to express the covered recipient's right to respond to the statement to challenge and correct any information included before the registered lobbyist files such report. Defines "covered recipient" as a federal candidate, an individual holding federal office, a leadership PAC (an unauthorized political committee which is associated with an individual holding federal office, excluding a political committee of a political party), a multicandidate political committee, or a political party committee.</summary>
