    "text": "Protection Against Wrongful Voter Purges Act - Amends the National Voter Registration Act to establish notice and review requirements for removal of individuals from a list of eligible voters by reason other than death or a change of residence. Requires the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to adopt voluntary guidance with respect to audits of the statewide computerized voter registration list so that each state will be able to ensure that the list: (1) reflects an accurate and complete count of all individuals validly registered to vote in federal elections; and (2) is secure against unauthorized uses. Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prohibit a state from refusing to register any applicant who has completed the national voter registration application form. Requires the appropriate state or local election official to ensure that, at each polling place for a federal election and on a public website of the election official of each registrar's jurisdiction, a list is available which shows: (1) all individuals registered to vote in that election at all polling places located in the registrar's jurisdiction; and (2) for each such individual, the polling place at which the individual is registered. Permits an individual to request exclusion from the list. Prohibits such list from containing an individual's address. Provides that this Act shall not apply to a state in which there is no voter registration requirement for individuals in the state with respect to federal elections."
