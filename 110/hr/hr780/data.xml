Counterfeit Drug Prevention Act of 2007 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to establish criminal penalties of a fine and imprisonment for not more than 20 years, or both, for any person who commits a prohibited act relating to counterfeiting knowing that: (1) the conduct concerns the rendering of a drug as a counterfeit drug; (2) the conduct will cause a drug to be a counterfeit drug; or (3) a drug, held, sold, or dispensed is a counterfeit drug. Increases the term of imprisonment to any term of years or for life if the use of a counterfeit drug is the proximate cause of a consumer's death. Modifies provisions pertaining to criminal fines for committing certain prohibited acts involving food, drugs, devices, or cosmetics.</summary>
