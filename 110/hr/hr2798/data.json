Directs OPIC to provide notice of consideration of approval of a project to provide financing of $10 million or more which significantly involves an extractive industry (as defined by this Act) to the appropriate congressional committees not later than 60 days before approval. Gives preference to projects where the investor and the host country have agreed to implement Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative principles.(Sec. 6) Provides for increased project transparency. Directs OPIC to maintain an Office of Accountability to provide project problem-solving services and to review OPIC compliance with environmental, social, worker rights, human rights, and transparency policies.(Sec. 7) Sets forth provisions respecting transparency and accountability of OPIC investment funds. (Sec. 8) Prohibits OPIC assistance for any railway connection that connects Azerbaijan and Turkey without traversing or connecting with Armenia.(Sec. 9) Prohibits OPIC assistance to an applicant who is involved in a \"discouraged transaction\" with state sponsors of terrorism. Defines \"discouraged transaction\" as: (1) an investment commitment of $20 million or more by the investor in the energy sector of a state sponsor of terrorism; (2) a loan or credit extension of more than $5 million to the government of a state sponsor of terrorism that is outstanding on the date OPIC enters into a contract with the investor and for which payment is not required within 45 days; and (3) the transfer by the investor of goods that are included on the U.S. Munitions List to a state sponsor of terrorism within the three-year period preceding the date OPIC enters into a contract with the investor.Exempts from such prohibition investments, business, or projects in certain areas of Sudan (Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, and Abyei, Darfur) if OPIC determines that such activities will provide humanitarian relief, promote self-sufficiency, or support peace agreements.(Sec. 10) Directs OPIC to notify the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations within 15 days after OPIC's maximum contingent liability outstanding at any one time exceeds the previous fiscal year's maximum contingent liability by 25%.(Sec. 11) Authorizes OPIC programs in Iraq. (Sec. 12) Directs OPIC to: (1) report to House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on the feasibility of broadening OPIC assistance to projects that provide support to low-income home buyers; and (2) provide such assistance if feasible.(Sec. 13) Requires that OPIC commit adequate staff and resources to assist small businesses and investors in the United States obtain insurance, reinsurance, financing, and other types of OPIC support.(Sec. 14) Makes technical corrections."
