    "text": "Security and Fuel Efficiency Energy Act of 2007, or the SAFE Energy Act of 2007 - Amends the Clean Air Act to: (1) revise renewable fuel standards for calendar years 2006-2020; (2) instruct the Secretary of Energy to assess the progress made toward creation of adequate infrastructure for the production and distribution of ethanol-blend fuel; and (3) require the Secretary to establish an incentives program for production of cellulosic ethanol and other emerging biofuels derived from renewable sources (including municipal solid waste). Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate regulations governing uniform labeling of certified biodiesel blends. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to implement a research and development program for carbon dioxide capture technologies to: (1) recover liquid fuels from oil shale; and (2) produce liquid fuels in coal utilization facilities in order to minimize carbon dioxide emissions. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide: (1) a phaseout of certain alternative fuels credits; and (2) a credit for advanced biomass fuel production. Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to study and report to specified congressional committees on the renewable fuels industry and market in the United States. Authorizes activities and exports involving hydrocarbon resources. Amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize under a general license for travel-related transactions for travel to, from, or within Cuba in connection with hydrocarbon resources exploration and extraction in any foreign maritime exclusive economic zone contiguous to the U.S. exclusive economic zone. Amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to reduce to 45 miles the range of the moratorium governing oil and gas leasing in the Eastern and Central Planning Area within the coastline of the state of Florida. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to inventory oil and natural gas resources beneath the waters of the outer Continental Shelf other than those in the Gulf of Mexico or off the coast of Florida. Requires such Secretary to offer for oil and natural gas leasing all inventoried areas. Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to direct the President to establish within the National Security Council a Bureau of International Energy. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to establish and operate a strategic energy infrastructure equipment reserve."
