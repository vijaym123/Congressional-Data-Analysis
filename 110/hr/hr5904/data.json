Requires: (1) owners and operators of facilities engaged in manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding food for consumption in the United States (with specified exceptions) to take specified steps regarding hazard evaluation, implementation of risk-based preventive controls, monitoring and verification of control performance, corrective actions, recordkeeping, and facility inspection; and (2) the Secretary to establish minimum standards for implementation of those requirements. Prohibits operation of a facility that processes or packs food for sale in the United States if the operator has not conducted the required hazard analysis or implemented reasonably appropriate science-based preventive controls or has failed to conduct a required reanalysis or to have a plan documenting compliance with such requirements.Requires each U.S. importer to adopt and document a foreign supplier safety assurance program to assure that imported food is in compliance, is not adulterated, and does not pose a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death.Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) certification of imports by a competent authority of an exporting country; (2) establishment of a voluntary qualified importer program; (3) recognition of qualified laboratories for analyses of imported foods; (4) establishment of regulations for the safe production, harvesting, and packaging of fruits and vegetables; and (5) recognition of third party certification programs.Grants the Secretary mandatory recall authority of food that will cause serious adverse health consequences.Directs the Secretary to develop a comprehensive plan to expand the technical, scientific, and regulatory capacity of foreign governments and food industries from which foods are exported to the United States."
