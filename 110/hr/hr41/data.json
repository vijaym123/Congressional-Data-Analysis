Amends the Federal Reserve Act to require the Board to survey biennially and report biennially to Congress on bank fees and certain services. Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, and the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, to repeal certain reporting requirements. Cites practices which shall not be treated as payment or receipt of interest if they relate to an escrow account maintained at a depository institution in connection with a real estate transaction."
