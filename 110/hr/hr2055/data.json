    "text": "Improving Children's Access to Health Care Act of 2007 - Provides that any state with a plan under title XIX (Medicaid) or XXI (State Children's Health Insurance) (SCHIP) of the Social Security Act (SSA) has a variety of options to promote enrollment of eligible children under such programs, including an option to create \"express lane eligibility.\" Amends SSA title XIX to authorize states to require satisfactory U.S. citizenship or nationality documentation for Medicaid, including tribal membership or enrollment. Give states the option to allow children of low-income state employees to enroll in SCHIP (thus ending the current mandatory exclusion of such children from SCHIP). Provides for new base SCHIP allotments responsive to increases in health care costs and enrollment expansions. Revises the current two-year initial availability of SCHIP allotments to limit it to fiscal years through FY2007. Requires only a one-year availability of allotments for FY2008 and succeeding fiscal years. Allows a 30-day SCHIP premium grace period."
