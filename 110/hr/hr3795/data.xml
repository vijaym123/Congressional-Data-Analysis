  <summary>10/10/2007--Introduced.
You Were There, You Get Care Act of 2007 - Presumes specified diseases, and any other disease found by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to result from exposure to depleted uranium or the byproducts of the burn-off that occurs when a depleted uranium munition penetrates a target, among those diseases that will be presumed to be service-connected (and therefore compensable) when appearing in radiation-exposed veterans. Includes, for purposes of such coverage, service during the Persian Gulf War or any subsequent conflict in which depleted uranium munitions are used. Directs the Secretary to provide for an independent medical study to determine other diseases that may result from exposure to depleted uranium. Requires study results to be submitted to the congressional veterans' committees.</summary>
