Allows each state with an approved part E plan to apply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) receive foster care maintenance payment savings achieved (in a \"child welfare reinvestment fund\") by reducing the total number of days children in the state experience in foster care during the fiscal year; and (2) use the savings to provide children with family preservation services, family support services, time-limited family reunification services, and adoption promotion and support services, and to train the staff of state and local child welfare agencies in effective service practices."
