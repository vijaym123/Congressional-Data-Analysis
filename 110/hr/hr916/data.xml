Defines "prosecutor" as a full-time state or local agency employee who: (1) is continually licensed to practice law; and (2) prosecutes criminal or juvenile delinquency cases, including an employee who supervises, educates, or trains other attorneys prosecuting such cases.Defines "public defender" as a licensed attorney who is a full-time state or local agency employee or a full-time employee of a nonprofit organization who provides legal representation to indigent persons in criminal or juvenile delinquency cases, including an attorney who supervises, educates, or trains other attorneys to provide such representation. Includes in such definition a full-time federal defender attorney.Directs the Attorney General to establish a program to assume the obligation to repay the student loans of any borrowers who are employed as prosecutors or public defenders and who are not in default on their loans. Sets forth requirements for such program, including that: (1) the borrower will remain employed as a prosecutor or public defender for not less than three years; and (2) the borrower will repay to the Attorney General any repayment benefits received if the borrower is fired from employment for misconduct or voluntarily separates from employment.Limits the amount payable under such program for any borrower to $10,000 per year andan aggregate total of $60,000.Authorizes the Attorney General to enter into subsequent agreements with a borrower for another three-year period or a lesser period.Requires the Attorney General to give priority in granting repayment benefits to borrowers who have the least ability to repay their loans.Authorizes the Attorney General to issue regulations to carry out this Act.Requires the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to report to Congress on the cost of loan repayment program under this Act and the impact of such program on the hiring and retention of prosecutors and public defenders.Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the impact of law school accreditation requirements and other factors on law school costs and access, including the impact of such requirements on racial and ethnic minorities.Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2013.</summary>
