Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that a sufficient number of full-time equivalent personnel, who are properly trained and qualified to apply legal, economic, and risk analyses, are involved in the review and prioritization of anti-terrorism technologies to determine whether such technologies may be designated or certified anti-terrorism technologies under the SAFETY Act.
