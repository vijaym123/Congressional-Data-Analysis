Directs the Secretary of State to report to Congress on the amount, type, and direction of all U.S. foreign aid for reducing black carbon pollution. States the policy of the United States with respect to international agreements and treaties relating to the reduction of black carbon emissions, protection of the Arctic environment, the the threat to polar bears from global warming, human rights under the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, and the reduction of shipping pollution through domestic means and through the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships (MARPOL)."
