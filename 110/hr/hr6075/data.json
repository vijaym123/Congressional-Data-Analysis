Requires the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to establish the National Guard Psychological Health Council. Directs the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs to jointly carry out: (1) one or more pilot programs on the provision of mental health services to members of the National Guard and reserves, both before and after deployment, through telemental health technologies; and (2) an outreach program intended to reduce the stigma, among members of the National Guard and reserves returning from deployment, and their families, associated with seeking and obtaining mental health services.
