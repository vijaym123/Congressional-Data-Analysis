Extends through 2012 the alternative motor vehicles tax credit for: (1) advanced lean burn technology motor vehicles; (2) qualified hybrid motor vehicles; and (3) qualified alternative fuel vehicles. Increases from 30 to 60% the rate of the tax credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property and extends such credit through 2012."
