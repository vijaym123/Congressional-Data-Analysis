Safe and Orderly Withdrawal From Iraq Act - Requires the Secretary of Defense, within 30 days after the enactment of this Act, to commence the withdrawal of units and members of the Armed Forces deployed in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, as well as contractors operating in Iraq under funds appropriated to the Department of Defense (DOD). Requires withdrawal completion within 180 days after its commencement. Prohibits DOD funds from being obligated or expended to: (1) increase the number of members serving in Iraq as of January 1, 2007, unless the increase has been specifically authorized in advance by an Act of Congress; or (2) further deploy units or members to Iraq. Provides withdrawal exceptions with respect to personnel: (1) providing security for U.S. diplomatic missions in Iraq; or (2) involved in Iraq reconstruction activities. Directs the President to transfer to the government of Iraq all rights in any military facility in Iraq that was constructed, repaired, or improved using amounts appropriated to DOD and occupied by a unit of the Armed Forces.</summary>
