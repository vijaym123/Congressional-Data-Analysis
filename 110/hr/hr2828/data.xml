  <summary>10/2/2007--Passed House amended.
Foreign Service Victims of Terrorism Act of 2007 - Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to provide a death gratuity for foreign national employees, foreign nationals appointees, and locally employed staff who die as a result of injuries suffered abroad in an amount equal to one year's basic salary at the highest step of the highest grade on the local compensation plan of the country in which the foreign staffer was being paid. Authorizes the Secretary of State or the head of a relevant agency to make an additional payment to the surviving dependents of a Foreign Service employee or a government executive branch employee killed as a result of an act of international terrorism in an amount equal to a maximum of eight times such employee's salary. Provides compensation retroactively to the families of each person killed in a terrorist act while serving on a U.S. diplomatic or consular mission abroad between Jan. 1, 1998, and the bill&#146;s enactment, including the victims of the August 1998 bombing in Nairobi, Kenya. States that with respect to a U.S. citizen such amount shall be 10 times the salary amount of $94,000 ($940,000).</summary>
