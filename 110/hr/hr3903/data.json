Requires the manufacturer of a product for children under five to label the product or its packaging to enable the purchaser to determine production information. Requires the CPSC to establish a database as a clearinghouse for information regarding factories, warehouses, or other facilities where consumer products which have been subject to a recall were manufactured."
