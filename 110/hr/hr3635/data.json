Requires recipients to agree to establish benchmarks for improvement in organ and tissue donation and to maintain registries that: (1) allow a donor to include a statement or symbol that the donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift; (2) allow organ procurement organizations to access that information, at or near the donor's death, 24 hours a day; and (3) bar the use or disclosure of personally identifiable information for any other purpose without the donor's consent.Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the feasibility of establishing a living donor database to track short- and long-term health effects for donors associated with living organ donation."
