  <summary>8/3/2007--Introduced.
National Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2007 - Establishes the National Commission on the Infrastructure of the United States to ensure that U.S. infrastructure meets current and future demand, facilitates economic growth, and is maintained in a manner that ensures public safety. Requires the Commission to study the state of U.S. infrastructure, including such matters as: (1) the capacity of infrastructure to sustain economic development and competitiveness; (2) the age and condition of infrastructure; (3) the methods used to finance the construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, and maintenance of infrastructure; (4) investment requirements needed to maintain and to improve infrastructure, including projected investment requirements and expenditures on infrastructure by federal, state, and local governments; (5) the impact of local development patterns on demand for federal funding of infrastructure; and (6) the collateral impact of deteriorated infrastructure. Directs the Commission to develop recommendations regarding: (1) a federal infrastructure plan that will detail national infrastructure program priorities; (2) infrastructure improvements and methods of delivering and providing for infrastructure facilities; (3) analysis or criteria and procedures that may be used by federal agencies and state and local governments in inventorying existing and needed infrastructure improvements, assessing the condition of improvements, developing uniform criteria and procedures, and maintaining publicly accessible data; and (4) proposed guidelines for the uniform reporting by federal agencies of data regarding infrastructure improvements.</summary>
