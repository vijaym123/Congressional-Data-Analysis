  <summary>7/31/2007--Introduced.
Healthy Start Reauthorization Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consider certain criteria in making grants under the Healthy Start Initiative, including: (1) factors that contribute to infant mortality, such as low birthweight; and (2) the extent to which applicants for grants facilitate a community-based approach to the delivery of services and a comprehensive approach to women's health care to improve perinatal outcomes.Provides that the Secretary is not prohibited from awarding grants for special projects that are intended to address significant disparities in perinatal health indicators in communities along the United States-Mexico border, or in Alaska, Hawaii, or any U.S. possession or territory.Eliminates authority for the Secretary to make additional grants to: (1) assist communities with technical assistance, replication of successful projects, and state policy formation to reduce infant and maternal mortality and morbidity; and (2) conduct and support research and to provide additional health care services for pregnant women and infants.Reauthorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2013 for the Healthy Start Initiative.</summary>
