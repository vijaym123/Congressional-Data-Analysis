  <summary>12/19/2007--Public Law.
Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 &#150; Title I: Energy Security Through Improved Vehicle Fuel Economy - Subtitle A: Increased Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards - Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act - (Sec. 102) Amends federal transportation law to instruct the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary in this title) to prescribe separate average fuel economy standards for passenger and for non-passenger automobiles for model years 2011-2030. Repeals the current requirement that the average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles manufactured after model year 1984 be 27.5 miles per gallon. Incorporates 27.5 miles per gallon into a formula for determining the minimum standard for domestically manufactured passenger automobiles.Requires the combined fuel economy average for model year 2020 to be at least 35 miles per gallon for the total fleet of passenger and non-passenger automobiles manufactured for sale in the United States for that model year.
