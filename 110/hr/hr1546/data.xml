Requires the Secretary of Defense, upon request of a member of the Armed Forces receiving outpatient care at or through Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Maryland, to transfer such member to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the receipt of such care. Requires such Secretaries to jointly provide such members information on the nature and quality of outpatient care services available through the Department of Veterans Afffairs (VA). Directs that the VA-chosen care be provided at the VA facility closest to the permanent duty station or residence of such member. Terminates the transfer requirement after certification from the Secretary of Defense to the congressional defense committees with respect to DOD processing of status claims and facility quality and the staffing of case management and psychological counselor positions at Walter Reed.</summary>
