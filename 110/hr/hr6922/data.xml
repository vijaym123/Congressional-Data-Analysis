  <summary>9/17/2008--Introduced.
Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make disaster loans to assist eligible small businesses that have suffered or are likely to suffer substantial economic injury as the result of increases in the price of gasoline or diesel fuel. Makes eligible for such loans small businesses engaged in the transportation of persons or property for hire. Limits loan amounts to $250,000, with an authorized waiver by the SBA. States that, for purposes of such assistance, no declaration of a disaster area is required.</summary>
