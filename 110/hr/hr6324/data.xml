  <summary>6/19/2008--Introduced.
Imported Ethanol Facilitation Act - Requires the President to: (1) reduce the temporary duty imposed on imported ethanol under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States by an amount equal to the reduction in any federal income or excise tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code for alcohol and ethanol blends used as fuel that occurs on or after January 1, 2009; and (2) take other necessary actions to ensure that the temporary duty imposed on imported ethanol does not exceed any federal income or excise tax credit applicable to ethanol. Directs the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce to report to Congress on the effects of the further reduction or elimination of the duty on ethanol (resulting in increased imports) on: (1) U.S. fuel prices and U.S. supplies; and (2) domestic production of ethanol.</summary>
