    "text": "Animal Protection Accountability Improvement Act - Amends the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit a person from using a live animal to: (1) demonstrate a medical device or product to a sales representative, or in a workshop or training session, for marketing purposes; (2) train a sales representative to use a medical device or product; or (3) create a multimedia recording for the purpose of marketing a medical device or product. Exempts from this requirement the training of medical personnel for a purpose other than marketing a medical device or product.Increases the cap on the fine for violations of humane standards and record keeping requirements at auction sales from $2,500 to $10,000 for each violation. Provides that each animal that is the subject of a violation shall be a separate offense.Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to include in a report to Congress an identification of all research facilities, intermediate handlers, carriers, and exhibitors registered under such Act."
