Parents&#146; Right to Know Improvement Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require local educational agencies (LEAs) to notify the parents of each student at the beginning of each school year that they will provide the parents, upon request, with timely information regarding the professional qualifications of their child's specialized instructional support persons. (This is in addition to the current requirement that LEAs provide parents, upon request, with information regarding the professional qualifications of their child's classroom teachers.) Defines "specialized instructional support persons" as school counselors, social workers, psychologists, or other qualified professionals providing services that are part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs.</summary>
