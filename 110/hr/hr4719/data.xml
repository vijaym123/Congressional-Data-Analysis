  <summary>12/17/2007--Introduced.
Additional Safeguards For Lease and Development of Non-Excess Property of Military Departments Act - Prohibits the lease of non-excess land that is under the control of a military department if the land is located in an area designated UBC Seismic Zone 4. Provides for an exception if the Secretary concerned determines that seismic activity would not have any significant impact on any portion of the proposed development under the lease. Prohibits such Secretary from omitting a revocation provision from a lease allowed under this exception. Requires revocation of previously-approved leases in such zones unless a lease is under substantial construction or the Secretary determines a lease should not be revoked.</summary>
