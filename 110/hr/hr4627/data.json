Provides that the aggregate amount of distributions received by an individual which may be treated as qualified mortgage relief distributions for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of $25,000, over the aggregate amounts treated as qualified mortgage delinquency relief distributions received by such individual for all prior taxable years. Defines such distributions as those made from an eligible retirement plan between the enactment of this Act and January 1, 2010, if: (1) the distribution is made during any 90-day period beginning on the date of any increase in the interest rate applicable to the acquisition indebtedness of the taxpayer's principal residence; and (2) taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year of such distribution does not exceed $114,000 ($166,000 in the case of a joint return)."
