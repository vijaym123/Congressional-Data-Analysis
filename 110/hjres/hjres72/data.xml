Amends Public Law 110-92 to extend through December 31, 2007, specified continuing appropriations for FY2008. Makes specified appropriations for payment to the heirs at law of Julia Carson, a former Representative from Indiana. Continues in effect throughout FY2008 the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care to any veteran who participated in a test conducted by the Department of Defense Deseret Test Center as part of a program for chemical and biological warfare testing from 1962 through 1973 (including the program designated as &#147;Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD)&#148; and related land-based tests). Continues in effect throughout FY2008 the Secretary's authority to furnish, when requested, an appropriate government headstone or marker at U.S. expense for the grave of an individual eligible for burial in a national cemetery, or an individual who at the time of death was entitled to military retired pay, who is buried in a private cemetery.</summary>
