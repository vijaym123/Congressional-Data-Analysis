Constitutional Amendment - Grants victims of violent crime the rights: (1) to reasonable and timely notice of any public proceeding involving the crime and of any release or escape of the accused; (2) to not be excluded from such public proceeding and reasonably to be heard at public release, plea, sentencing, reprieve, and pardon proceedings; and (3) to adjudicative decisions that consider the victim's safety, interest in avoiding unreasonable delay, and just and timely claims to restitution from the offender. Prohibits any restriction of such rights except as dictated by a substantial interest in public safety or the administration of criminal justice, or by other compelling necessity.</summary>
