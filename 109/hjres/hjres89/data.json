Directs the President to do the same regarding such a determination for each law enacted before enactment of this Act for the 107th through the 109th Congresses. Prescribes expedited procedures in the House of Representatives for legislation in response to such determinations. Requires the General Counsel of the House, at the request of a Member of the House, to prepare a report describing legal actions which may be brought to challenge the President's refusal to carry out any duly enacted provision of law."
