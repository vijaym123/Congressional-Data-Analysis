  <summary>11/8/2005--Passed House amended.
Recognizes and commends employers of members of the National Guard and other reserve components who have been mobilized during the Global War on Terrorism and in support of hurricane disaster relief operations. Urges the Secretary of Defense to continue to develop long-term strategies to maintain a high level of support between such employers through: (1) the Civilian Employment Information Program database; (2) a more predictable system for the mobilization and demobilization of such members; and (3) opportunities to address employer groups on future mobilization plans and future roles of the reserve components.</summary>
