  <summary>12/6/2005--Passed House amended.
Commends the people of Hungary as they mark the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution which set the stage for the ultimate collapse of communism in 1989 throughout Central and Eastern Europe, including Hungary, and two years later in the Soviet Union itself. Expresses condolences to the people of Hungary for those who lost their lives fighting for Hungarian freedom in 1956, as well as for those subsequently executed by the Soviet and Hungarian communist authorities, including Prime Minister Imre Nagy. Welcomes the changes that have taken place in Hungary since 1989, believing that Hungary's integration into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), together with similar developments in the neighboring countries, will ensure peace and understanding among the peoples of the Carpathian Basin. Reaffirms the friendship between the governments of Hungary and the United States and between the Hungarian and American people.</summary>
