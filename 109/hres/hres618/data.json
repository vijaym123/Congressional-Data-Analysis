    "text": "Supports Lebanese government efforts to respect the victims' remains in the Anjar mass graves and protect the viability of the evidence. Calls on the President to direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to seek adoption of a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an investigation into the Lebanese disappeared and all mass graves. Urges that revisions be made to the 1991 Amnesty Law to allow for the prosecution of those responsible for the murder and disappearance of Lebanese citizens prior to 1991. Insists that the government of Syria cease its continued efforts to silence Lebanese critics, and to otherwise hold Lebanon captive. Demands that the government of Syria be further sanctioned under U.S. law for its continuing infringement of Lebanese sovereignty and be held accountable for its continuing violations of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1595, and 1636."
