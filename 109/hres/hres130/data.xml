  <summary>4/20/2005--Passed House amended.
Expresses support for the goals and ideals of National Indoor Comfort Week, as proposed by the Air Conditioning Contractors of America (April 17-23, 2005). Recognizes the contributions that environmental systems (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration systems) have made to our quality of life and commends system technicians. Recognizes that the small business contractors who install such systems have benefited from a reduced regulatory burden, commends such contractors for participating in Occupational Safety and Health Administration panels, and recognizes that such contractors have actively supported the Small Business Administration loan guarantee program.</summary>
