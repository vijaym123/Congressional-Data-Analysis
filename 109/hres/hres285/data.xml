  <summary>5/17/2005--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the Attorney General should undertake to protect and expand equality of opportunity for qualified minorities, disabled persons, and women at every opportunity; (2) affirmative action is a powerful, effective, and necessary tool for achieving such equal opportunity without quotas, and should be used in the public and private sectors to increase diversity and to correct patterns of past and current discrimination; and (3) the President should incorporate affirmative action into the employment, contracting, granting, educational, and program activities of the United States and all its subcontractors and grantees.</summary>
