Expresses concern over the PRC's unacceptable human rights conditions. Urges the Federal Government and the EU to: (1) develop a common human rights strategy for the PRC, promote regional stability, and seek to improve Taiwan-PRC political relations; and (2) discuss strengthening the European code-of-conduct to ensure that safeguards are in place to make military sales or transfers to the PRC difficult, and to consider negotiating a new transatlantic agreement on future military sales or transfers to \"countries of concern.\""
