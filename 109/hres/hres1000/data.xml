  <summary>9/13/2006--Reported to House amended.
Makes it out of order in the House of Representatives to consider: (1) a bill reported by a committee unless the report includes a list of earmarks in the bill or in the report (and the names of the requesting Members); or (2) a conference report on a bill unless the joint explanatory statement accompanying it includes a list of earmarks in it or in the joint statement (and the names of the requesting Members) that were not committed to the conference committee by either Chamber, not in the committee report, and not in a Senate committee report on a companion measure. Defines tax earmarks as any revenue-losing provision that benefits only one beneficiary. Makes it out of order in the House to consider a bill carrying a tax measure reported by the Ways and Means Committee in which the Joint Committee on Taxation has: (1) identified a tax earmark, unless the report on the bill includes a list of tax earmarks in it or in the report (and the names of the requesting Members); or (2) failed to provide such analysis. Makes it out of order in the House to consider a conference report carrying such a measure as to which the Joint Committee on Taxation has: (1) identified a tax earmark, unless the accompanying joint explanatory statement includes a list of tax earmarks in it or in the joint statement (and the names of the requesting Members) that were not committed to the conference committee by either Chamber, not in the Committee report, and not in a Senate committee report on a companion measure; or (2) failed to provide such analysis. Makes it out of order in the House to consider a rule or order that waives the requirements of this Act with respect to consideration of conference reports. Requires the Joint Committee to: (1) review any bill containing a tax measure that is being reported by the Ways and Means Committee or prepared for filing by a conference committee; (2) identify whether such bill contains any tax earmarks; and (3) provide the Ways and Means Committee and the conference committee with a statement identifying such earmarks or declaring that the legislation does not contain any. Requires the statement to be included in the committee report or joint statement of managers, as applicable.</summary>
