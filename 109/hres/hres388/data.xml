Condemns the gross human rights violations committed by the Cuban regime. Expresses support for the right of the Cuban people to exercise fundamental political and civil liberties, including freedoms of expression, assembly, association, movement, the press, and the right to multiparty elections. Calls on the: (1) Secretary of State to initiate an international solidarity campaign on behalf of the release of all Cuban political prisoners; (2) European Union (EU) to reexamine its current policy toward the Cuban regime before June of 2006; and (3) U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, and other international organizations, to work with United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) member countries to ensure a resolution that strongly condemns the July 2005 measures of repression on opposition activists and of all the human rights violations committed by the Cuban regime.</summary>
