(Continues the current prohibition regarding direct personal or pecuniary interest in any pending or reported legislative measure, or employment by or representation of any party or organization for the purpose of influencing, directly or indirectly, the passage, defeat, or amendment of any legislative proposal.) Authorizes the Speaker of the House to promulgate regulations exempting ceremonial or educational functions from these prohibitions.
