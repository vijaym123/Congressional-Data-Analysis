    "text": "Reaffirms steadfast support for Israel. Condemns Hamas and Hezbollah for: (1) engaging in unprovoked and reprehensible attacks against Israel on undisputed Israeli territory, for taking hostages, for killing Israeli soldiers, and for indiscriminately targeting Israeli civilian populations with rockets and missiles; and (2) exploiting civilian populations as shields, locating their equipment and bases of operation, including rockets and other armaments, amidst civilian populations, including in homes and mosques. Recognizes Israel's commitment to minimizing civilian loss and welcomes Israel's efforts to prevent civilian casualties. Demands that Iran and Syria direct Hamas and Hezbollah to immediately and unconditionally release the captive Israeli soldiers. Affirms that all governments that have provided continued support to Hamas or Hezbollah share responsibility for the hostage-taking and attacks against Israel and should be held accountable for their actions. Condemns the governments of Iran and Syria for their continued support for Hezbollah and Hamas in their attacks against Israelis and other terrorist activities. Supports Israel's right to defend itself, including to conduct operations both in Israel and in the territory of threatening nations in accordance with international law, including Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Commends the President of the United States for fully supporting Israel as it responds to attacks by terrorist organizations and their state sponsors. Urges the President to bring the full force of U.S. political, diplomatic, and economic sanctions against the governments Syria and Iran. Demands that the government of Lebanon do everything in its power to free the kidnapped Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon. Calls on the U.N. Security Council to: (1) condemn these unprovoked acts; and (2) ensure full implementation of Security Council 1559, which requires that Hezbollah be dismantled and all Syrian personnel and Iranian Revolutionary Guards leave Lebanon. Expresses condolences to all families of innocent victims of recent violence. Declares a continued commitment to working with Israel and other U.S. allies to fight terrorism."
