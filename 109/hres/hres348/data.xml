  <summary>6/30/2005--Introduced.
Congratulates the people of Lebanon for their determination to peacefully demonstrate and assemble, conduct parliamentary elections in May and June 2005, and exercise their right to vote in the face of the political assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, bombings, and intimidation. Urges the new parliamentary assembly in Lebanon to take steps to heal sectarian divisions and fulfill the government of Lebanon's obligation to implement the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 calling for the disbanding of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias and extending government control over all Lebanese territory. Recognizes that peaceful change of power and the process of democratization in Lebanon should be recognized as an important step toward the advancement of Middle East democracy. Supports international involvement to facilitate investigations into the terrorist attacks in Lebanon.</summary>
