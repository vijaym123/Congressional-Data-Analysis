  <summary>2/28/2006--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) pluralistic and geographic expansion is necessary for its continued effectiveness and relevance; (2) Israel's demonstrated commitment to uphold democracy and to combat terrorism, in addition to its strategic and military capabilities, make Israel deserving of NATO membership; (3) the United States, as Israel's strong ally, should take the lead in supporting an upgrade in Israel's NATO relationship to that of a leading member of NATO's Individual Cooperation Program as a first step toward Israel's full NATO membership; and (4) Israel's deepened relationship with NATO would be mutually beneficial to both Israel and NATO member states, including the United States.</summary>
