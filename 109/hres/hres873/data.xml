  <summary>6/16/2006--Introduced.
Reaffirms the importance of the relationship between the United States and the European Union (EU). Recognizes that the United States and Europe face multiple and common challenges and must continue to adapt the transatlantic partnership which has served both so well. Expresses support for the success of the June 2006 US-EU Summit in Vienna, Austria, and encourages agreements on issues such as support for global freedom, democracy, and human rights, a successful conclusion of the World Trade Organization Doha Development Agenda, and a workable transatlantic energy security strategy. Joins with the European Parliament in agreeing to continue to strengthen the transatlantic partnership by enhancing dialogue and collaboration between the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament through the Transatlantic Legislators Dialogue and other legislative exchanges.</summary>
