  <summary>6/30/2005--Introduced.
Condemns the government of Mexico for issuing a racist series of postage stamps. Calls on Mexican President Vincente Fox to: (1) cease such stamps' printing and distribution and recall those stamps currently in circulation; and (2) apologize to the citizens of Mexico and the United States for the decision to circulate the stamps. Declares that the government of Mexico's decision to issue the stamps is inconsistent with U.S. policy to eliminate vestiges of government sanctioned racial or ethnic discrimination or intolerance.</summary>
