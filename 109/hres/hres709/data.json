Makes exceptions for: (1) legislation containing classified information if Members have at least seven days to study the contents; and (2) congressional declarations of war or authorization of military force to respond to attacks on the United States. Deems any Member who votes for a measure in violation of such rule to have violated House ethics rules and to be subject to censure. Allows any citizen who is eligible to vote and who is not an executive or judicial branch employee to petition the Committee on Standards and Official Conduct to investigate allegations of violations of such rule. Prohibits the Rules Committee from waiving such rule."
