  <summary>2/17/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to: (1) require conference reports to include Congressional Budget Office cost estimates in their accompanying joint statements if such legislation provides for new budget, spending, or credit authority or otherwise provides an increase or decrease in revenues or tax expenditures; (2) prohibit consideration of such conference reports if the cost estimates are not included; (3) require roll call votes on legislation authorizing or providing new budget authority of at least $50 million; (4) repeal rule XXVII (the Gephardt Rule, relating to mandatory adjustment of the statutory limit on the public debt to conform to a budget resolution); and (5) revise rule XIII (prohibiting same-day consideration of Rules Committee reports) to extend the prohibition to the same calendar day or less than 17 hours after that. Prohibits the Rules Committee from reporting a rule or order without two-thirds of the Members voting, a quorum being present to waive the layover requirement concerning the availability of reports, the three-day layover requirement, the three-day Internet availability requirement, or the scope requirement. Prohibits consideration by the House of: (1) reported legislation until the third calendar day on which the underlying measure or matter has been made available by the Rules Committee on its Internet site; or (2) a conference report until the third calendar day on which such conference report and its joint explanatory statement have been made available on its Internet site by the standing committee of the House with subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying legislation. Requires: (1) the report that accompanies any general appropriation bill to contain a separate written justification for each earmark contained in such bill or report; and (2) each committee to report at six-month intervals to the Speaker and the minority leader on its compliance with its oversight plan. Requires such biannual reports to be made available to the public.</summary>
