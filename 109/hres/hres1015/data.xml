Res. 1015 violate the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by imposing an unfunded mandate and made a point of order against the consideration of the resolution. Subsequently, the Chair noted that the required threshhold of identifying the specific language in question had been met, and the House proceeded with 20 minutes of debate on the question of consideration.</text>
