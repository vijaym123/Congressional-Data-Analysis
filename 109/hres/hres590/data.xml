  <summary>12/7/2005--Introduced.
Commends Bosnia and Herzegovina for the significant progress it has made over the past decade in implementing the Dayton Peace Accords, in particular with respect to police and defense reforms. Supports the aspiration of Bosnia and Herzegovina to become a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace, and reaffirms the importance of Bosnia and Herzegovina's participation in the European integration process. Encourages the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue economic and constitutional reforms. Urges the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and authorities at all levels of government to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, as well as the newly established War Crimes Chamber in the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Recognizes the important role of those who fled Bosnia and Herzegovina during the conflict and subsequently became U.S. citizens in further improving bilateral relations between the two countries.</summary>
