  <summary>10/19/2005--Introduced.
Condemns the actions taken by the government of the Republic of Cameroon against Ambassador Henry Fossung, his family, his house guests, and the members of the Southern Cameroons National Council. Affirms that the United States holds the government of the Republic of Cameroon responsible for upholding the rights of its citizens and nationals, regardless of political views, and urges the government to extend to all Cameroon's citizens the rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations and other international covenants on human rights. Calls upon the President of the United States to: (1) assert U.S. concerns regarding such matters, and emphasize that the United States regards the government of the Republic of Cameroon's human rights practices as having a negative impact on U.S.-Cameroon relations; (2) urge the government of the Republic of Cameroon to emancipate members of the Southern Cameroons National Council; and (3) cooperate with international organizations and other governments to protect the human rights of freedom of thought and speech of all citizens and nationals of Cameroon.</summary>
