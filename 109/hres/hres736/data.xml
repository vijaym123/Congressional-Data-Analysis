  <summary>3/29/2006--Passed House without amendment.
Condemns the enforcement of laws against apostasy. Requests the President to continue to work with the government of Afghanistan to establish better protections for religious minorities, including converts to minority religions, and to enhance human rights protections in Afghanistan. Calls upon the government of Afghanistan, and especially President Hamid Karzai, to continue to conform Afghan laws to Afghanistan's international human rights treaty obligations, thereby protecting from prosecution Afghan citizens who have converted or plan to convert to other religions.</summary>
