  <summary>6/12/2006--Passed House amended.
Condemns the actions of the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to coerce Catholic bishops in China, both those in the Catholic Patriotic Association of China and those who remain loyal to the Pope, to violate their consciences and consecrate bishops in defiance of Rome. Extends deepest sympathy to the Catholic population of China and the Catholic Church for this insult to their beliefs and religious practices. Reaffirms the right of all religious organizations to choose their leaders free of intimidation or terror in accordance with the Uniform Declaration of Human Rights. Urges the PRC to end its repression of religious organizations, recognize the ecclesiastical authority of religious leaders to provide spiritual leadership to their followers, and end the practice of only allowing religious worship through state-sanctioned patriotic religious associations. Encourages the PRC to refrain from additional ordination of Catholic bishops while the Vatican and the Catholic Patriotic Association of China resolve their differences and adopt a mutually acceptable process for approving the elevation of bishops.</summary>
