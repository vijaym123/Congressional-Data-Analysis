Calls on the government of the United Kingdom to: (1) reconsider its position on the matter of an inquiry into Mr. Finucane's murder; (2) amend the Inquiries Act of 2005; and (3) take fully into account objections raised by Judge Cory, U.S. government officials, other governments and international bodies, and Mr. Finucane's family. Urges the government of the United Kingdom to establish a full, independent, and public judicial inquiry into Mr. Finucane's murder which would enjoy the support of his family, the people of Northern Ireland, and the international community as recommended by Judge Cory."
