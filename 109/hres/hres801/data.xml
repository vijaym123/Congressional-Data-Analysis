  <summary>5/4/2006--Introduced.
Reiterates support for restoration of multiparty democracy in Nepal and reconciliation between King Gyanendra of Nepal and the opposition political parties. Condemns the Maoist insurgency in Nepal which has engaged in civilian atrocities. Recognizes the difficulties the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) faces in countering the Maoist threat, but deplores RNA human rights violations. Regrets the loss of life and injuries that occurred during the nearly three weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations. Urges the government of Nepal and the political parties to provide the necessary food, medical care, and infrastructure necessary to rebuild the country. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that King Gyanendra should: (1) restore multiparty democracy; (2) prevent a Maoist takeover of Nepal; and (3) restore security, government services, and political and human rights.</summary>
