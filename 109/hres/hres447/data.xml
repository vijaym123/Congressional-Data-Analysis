  <summary>9/15/2005--Introduced.
Prohibits the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards from finding that the mailing by a Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner) is not frankable solely because it includes a solicitation of funds for or on behalf of an entity to support relief efforts and activities in response to a major disaster for which the President has made a declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (or, in the case of a mailing sent electronically, includes a link to such a solicitation on an Internet site), if the entity is included in the list of relief organizations responding to the disaster which is maintained or referred to in official notices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</summary>
