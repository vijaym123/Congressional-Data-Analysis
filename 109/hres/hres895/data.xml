    <title as="introduced" type="official">Supporting intelligence and law enforcement programs to track terrorists and terrorist finances conducted consistent with Federal law and with appropriate Congressional consultation and specifically condemning the disclosure and publication of classified information that impairs the international fight against terrorism and needlessly exposes Americans to the threat of further terror attacks by revealing a crucial method by which terrorists are traced through their finances.</title>

  <summary>6/29/2006--Passed House without amendment.
Expresses support for efforts to identify, track, and pursue suspected foreign terrorists and their financial supporters by tracking terrorist money flows and uncovering terrorist networks, including through the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. Condemns the unauthorized disclosure of classified information and expresses concern that such disclosure may endanger the lives of Americans as well as individuals and organizations that support U.S. efforts. Declares that the House of Representatives: (1) finds that the Program has been conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, that appropriate safeguards and reviews have been instituted to protect civil liberties, and that Congress has been appropriately informed and consulted and will continue Program oversight; and (2) expects the cooperation of all news media organizations in protecting American lives and the government's capability to identify, disrupt, and capture terrorists by not disclosing classified intelligence programs, such as the Program.</summary>
