Expresses gratitude to: (1) the U.S. Armed Forces for their valiant service and commitment to the highest ideals and traditions of the United States; and (2) the families of U.S. Armed Forces personnel. Reaffirms that U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq will remain under the full authority of their U.S. commanders. Urges the people of the United States and other countries to celebrate this latest step in the restoration of Iraqi freedom. Reaffirms that the world is safer when democracy replaces tyranny."
