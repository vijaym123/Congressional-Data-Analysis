  <summary>2/2/2005--Passed House without amendment.
Congratulates the people of Iraq and the elected candidates for having taken part in the historic 2005 Iraqi election, and offers continued support as they deal with the consequences of decades of misrule under Saddam Hussein. Thanks the Interim Government of Iraq and the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, Iraqi and Coalition security forces, and the civilian U.S. and international partners for their efforts to create the conditions in which a free election could be held. Expresses condolences to the families of those Iraqis who perished while attempting to vote or while protecting Iraqis who were doing so. Expresses gratitude to: (1) the U.S. Armed Forces for their valiant service and commitment to the highest ideals and traditions of the United States; and (2) the families of U.S. Armed Forces personnel. Reaffirms that U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq will remain under the full authority of their U.S. commanders. Urges the people of the United States and other countries to celebrate this latest step in the restoration of Iraqi freedom. Reaffirms that the world is safer when democracy replaces tyranny.</summary>
