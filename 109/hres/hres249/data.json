Commends: (1) those individuals who spotted, video recorded, and verified the presence of the bird; and (2) the private and public landowners of Arkanas who protected the species' critical habitat. Encourages the the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture to continue working with all parties in Arkansas who have so successfully maintained such habitat. Congratulates the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission, and the Nature Conservancy for their leadership in preserving the bottomland hardwood habitat."
