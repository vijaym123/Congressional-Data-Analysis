Reinforces the educational commitment to promote the best interests of American Indian and Alaska Native children by reinforcing native cultural and language development which strengthens, preserves, and promotes cultural identity. Recognizes that it is imperative that the federal government sharpen its focus and commitment to title VII of the No Child Left Behind Act consistent with the desires of American Indian and Alaska Native people. Recognizes that education is significantly linked to overall quality of life and therefore must be prioritized and organized to meet the unique and specialized needs of American Indian and Alaska Native students."
