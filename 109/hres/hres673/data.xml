  <summary>3/8/2006--Passed House without amendment.
States that a precondition for the integration of Belarus into the Western community of nations is its establishment of a genuinely democratic political system. Expresses support for the efforts of the Belarusian people to establish a full democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights in Belarus. Urges the government of Belarus to: (1) guarantee freedom of association and assembly, and (2) meet its Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) standards and commitments on democratic elections. Urges the Belarusian authorities to ensure: (1) transparency procedures for the 2006 presidential election; (2) election monitor access; (3) multiparty representation on all election commissions; (4) media access by all parties and candidates; (5) freedom of candidates, members of opposition parties, and independent media organizations from government harassment; and (6) prosecution of election law violators. Encourages the international community to continue efforts to support democracy in Belarus and urges countries such as Lithuania and other Baltic countries and Nordic countries to continue to provide assistance to nongovernmental organizations and other Belarusian organizations involved in promoting democracy and fair elections. Pledges support to the Belarusian people, their commitment to a democratic system and creation of a free market economy, and their country's assumption of its place as a full and equal member of the Western community of democracies.</summary>
