  <summary>12/8/2006--Passed House without amendment.
Expresses condolences to the people of Lebanon and to the members of Lebanon's Cabinet for the terrorist assassination of Industry Minister Pierre Amin Gemayel. Affirms support for the international tribunal to try suspects in the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Urges that the perpetrators of Pierre Gemayel's assassination be brought to justice. Expresses concern regarding the increasing polarization of Lebanon's religious sects and calls on the government of Lebanon to pursue electoral reform as a first step in reducing confessional tensions. Recognizes that a regional peace in the Middle East will greatly contribute to Lebanon's long-term security and stability. Reaffirms the U.S. commitment to promote the development of democratic institutions in Lebanon, including an independent Parliament and a strong central government that serve the interests of the Lebanese people.</summary>
