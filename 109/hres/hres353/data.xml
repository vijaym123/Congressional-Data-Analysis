  <summary>7/11/2005--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) it is in the best interests of the United States, as a facilitator of peaceful relations between India and Pakistan, to support the India-Pakistan agreement to construct a natural gas pipeline; (2) a natural gas pipeline through Pakistan to India is a vehicle for furthering U.S. national security, and would ensure energy security for Pakistan and India, while strengthening the peace process and fostering greater economic cooperation between the two historically hostile countries; and (3) India-Pakistan linkages should be encouraged as they have the potential to contribute to world peace.</summary>
