Calls upon the North Korean government to cease abductions, release all kidnapping victims and prisoners-of-war still alive in North Korea, and provide a full and verifiable accounting of all other cases. Recognizes that while resolution of the nuclear issue with North Korea is of critical importance, U.S. officials should not be precluded from raising abduction cases and other human rights concerns in future negotiations with North Korea. Calls upon the U.S. government not to remove the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the Department of State's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism until North Korea renounces state-sponsored kidnapping and provides a full accounting of all abduction cases. Admonishes the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the forced repatriation to North Korea of Han Man-taek, a South Korean prisoner-of-war and comrade-in-arms of the United States, and for its failure to exercise sovereign control over North Korean agents operating freely within its borders."
