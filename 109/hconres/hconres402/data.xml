  <summary>5/17/2006--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that specified congressional committees should take a more active role in determining and reporting on the activities and progress of the government of Iraq in securing and stabilizing Iraq. Requires the congressional committees to review and evaluate the specific activities and level of success of such government and report their findings and conclusions, as appropriate, to the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to preclude the appropriate congressional committees from establishing ad hoc advisory committees to advise and assist them in carrying out the review and evaluation.</summary>
