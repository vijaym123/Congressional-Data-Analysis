  <summary>3/3/2005--Introduced.
Condemns the arrest of Ayman Nour, the leader of the Al Ghad party, by the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt. Calls on the Government of Egypt to release Ayman Nour, and to ensure that if tried, he and his deputy, Mousa Mustafa, be charged and tried in a regular criminal court and not a State Security or State Security Emergency Court. Expresses support for: (1) the people of Egypt as they struggle for democracy; and (2) President George W. Bush's call for greater democracy in Egypt. Encourages: (1) the President and the Secretary of State to assist human rights activists and the nonviolent democratic opposition in Egypt; and (2) the People's Assembly of Egypt to follow through on President Mubarak's call for changes to the Egyptian Constitution that would permit direct, contested presidential elections.</summary>
