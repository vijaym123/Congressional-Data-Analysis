Acknowledges the cooperation of some Western Hemisphere governments to deny the use of their territory to Islamist terrorist organizations and calls on all governments to intensify such efforts. Encourages the President to direct the United States Representative to the Organization of American States (OAS) to: (1) seek OAS support for the creation of a special task force of the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE) to assist in investigating and combating the proliferation of Islamist terrorist organizations in the Western Hemisphere; and (2) urge OAS countries to designate Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, al-Qaeda and other such groups as terrorist organizations."
