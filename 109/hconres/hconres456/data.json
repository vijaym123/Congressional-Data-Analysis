Prohibits the use of such funds for operation, repair, or construction costs, except for the costs of constructing interpretive exhibits. Sets the maximum federal share of any project under this Act at 50%, and requires a nonfederal match. Terminates the authorities of the Secretary of the Interior under such law on September 30, 2007. Requires the Secretary to prepare a strategic plan that describes opportunities to increase participation in the planning, development, and administration of the route and organizational options for sustaining it."
