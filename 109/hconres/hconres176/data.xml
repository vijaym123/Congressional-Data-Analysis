  <summary>6/9/2005--Introduced.
Commends W. Mark Felt (the former Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Watergate whistleblower known as "Deep Throat") for his uncommon courage in exposing major government corruption that warranted Senate Watergate Committee hearings and a House Judiciary Committee impeachment investigation. Encourages FBI employees aware of wrongdoing to follow Felt's example and come forward with relevant information. Recognizes the important role that anonymous sources play in honest and accurate reporting by journalists and the importance of respecting that anonymity and freedom of speech.</summary>
