  <summary>4/6/2006--Passed House amended.
Condemns: (1) the arbitrary detention of Dr. Pham Hong Son and others by the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and calls for their immediate release; and (2) the violations of freedom of speech, religion, movement, association, and the lack of due process afforded to individuals in Vietnam. Urges the government of Vietnam to: (1) consider the implications of its actions for the broader U.S.-Vietnam relationship; and (2) allow access to the Central Highlands and to the Northwest Highlands by foreign diplomats, the international press, and nongovernmental organizations. Applauds the European Parliament for its December 2005 resolution regarding human rights in Vietnam, and urges the government of Vietnam to comply with such resolution. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) make the immediate release of Dr. Pham Hong Son a top concern; (2) continue to urge the government of Vietnam to comply with internationally recognized standards for basic freedoms and human rights; (3) make clear to the government of Vietnam that it must adhere to the rule of law and respect the freedom of the press in order to broaden its relations with the United States; (4) make clear to the government of Vietnam that the detention of Dr. Pham and others is not in the interest of Vietnam because such detentions create obstacles to improved U.S. relations; and (5) reiterate its deep concern over the continued imprisonment of Dr. Son and other persons whose human rights are being violated and discuss the legal status and immediate humanitarian needs of such individuals with the government of Vietnam.</summary>
