  <summary>3/17/2005--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Lebanese Republic is a captive country; (2) the occupation of Lebanon by Syria represents a long-term threat to the security of the Middle East and to U.S. efforts to promote regional political and economic liberalization, and this issue should be raised by the President and the Secretary of State in all appropriate bilateral and multilateral forums; (3) it should be U.S. policy to support human rights and pro-democracy advocates in Lebanon and seek the full restoration of sovereign democratic rule in Lebanon; (4) the President should direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) to secure support for a UN Security Council Resolution classifying Lebanon as a captive country and calling for the immediate release of all Lebanese detainees in Syria and Lebanon; (5) the President should freeze all U.S. assets belonging to Lebanese government officials who support the occupation of Lebanon by Syria; (6) all countries should implement UN Security Council Resolution 1559; and (7) the United States should provide assistance through the Middle East Partnership Initiative and the Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative for broadcasts and civil society efforts to assist individuals and entities that support Lebanese democratic sovereignty.</summary>
