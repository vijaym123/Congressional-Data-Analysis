  <summary>4/27/2006--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that, as the leaders of the United States and the Republic of India have expressed commitment to the values of human freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, it is in U.S. interests to address the treatment of the Dalits and Tribals in India by: (1) raising the issue of caste discrimination and untouchability; (2) inviting Dalit organizations to participate in the planning and implementation of U.S. development projects; (3) prioritizing funding for projects that positively impact Dalit and Tribal communities; (4) encouraging international financial institutions to consider caste discrimination when funding development projects; (5) ensuring that U.S. government employees and contractors in India are aware that it is U.S. policy that caste discrimination is unacceptable; (6) ensuring that qualified Dalits are not discouraged from applying for U.S. government and private employment in India; and (7) monitoring the activities and funds of the Vishva Hindu Parishad and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the United States that are used to support groups that have perpetrated acts of violence against Dalits, Tribals, and religious minorities in India.</summary>
