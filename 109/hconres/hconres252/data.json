Denounces the previous attempts by the National Assembly to encroach unconstitutionally upon the powers of the executive branch, undermine the ability to govern the country, and advance the personal ambitions of some of its current and former members. Applauds the diplomatic efforts of the Organization of American States (OAS) for demonstrating the viability of the Inter-American Charter as an effective instrument in the Western Hemisphere for overcoming obstacles that impede institutions from governing democratically. Concurs with the convening of a broad National Dialogue to address the challenges that confront the Nicaraguan people as they attempt to build a more effective democracy. Supports the efforts of the government of Nicaragua and Nicaraguan democratic civil society to create conditions for free and fair 2006 elections. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it should be U.S. policy to support democratic political forces and work with regional and international organizations, including the OAS, to bolster Nicaraguan efforts to establish conditions for free and inclusive 2006 presidential and legislative elections; and (2) the President of the United States should ensure that any electoral or democracy and governance assistance is provided only for the purposes of training election observers and ensuring the electoral process' integrity, that such assistance be provided through nongovernmental organizations on a nonpartisan basis, and that the details of such assistance be made public in both countries."
