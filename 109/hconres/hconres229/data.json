Urges the Bush Administration to: (1) provide debt-relief and trade benefits to countries that adhere to the principles of transparency, human rights, and democracy; and (2) work with local organizations in Africa that monitor oil wealth management. Urges the United Nations to: (1) support multilateral transparency and make the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act enforceable international law; and (2) use the U.N. development program to promote transparency, poverty reduction, and democratic participation in civil society. Urges oil companies operating in Africa to: (1) pursue local content development projects and participate in joint ventures with indigenous companies; (2) disclose taxes, fees, and other payments made to African governments; and (3) participate with the U.S. African-American business community in economic development opportunities in the Gulf of Guinea region. Urges the President to encourage leaders of African countries to: (1) implement local content development programs; (2) invest a portion of the current oil revenue of each such country to prepare for a post-oil future; (3) guarantee human rights, transparency, and full civil participation in the democratic process; and (4) provide for fair employment of women within the energy sector."
