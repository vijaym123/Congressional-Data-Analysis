  <summary>5/25/2006--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the Administration should tell Iraqi political, religious, and tribal leaders that: (1) the U.S. military presence in Iraq is neither unending nor unconditional; (2) whether the Iraqis avoid all-out civil war and have a future as a nation is in their hands; and (3) forming a government of national unity and subsequent agreement to modifications to the Iraq Constitution to make it more inclusive, within the deadlines the Iraqis have set for themselves in the Iraq Constitution, is essential to quelling the sectarian and insurgent-led violence and avoiding all-out civil war, and will enable the Iraqi government to assume security responsibilities now borne by the U.S. military.</summary>
