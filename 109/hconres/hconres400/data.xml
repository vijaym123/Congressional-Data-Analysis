  <summary>7/26/2006--Passed House amended.
Condemns: (1) the actions and inactions of the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela with respect to criminal drug trafficking; (2) the failure of the government of Venezuela to stem the flow of illicit narcotics through its territory; and (3) the complicity of Venezuelan law enforcement and transportation officials in enabling large scale shipments of cocaine and heroin through the Simon Bolivar International Airport and other transit points. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it should continue to be U.S. policy to support cooperation between Venezuela and its partners in the Andean region to combat drug trafficking; (2) efforts to restore bilateral law enforcement cooperation between Venezuela and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration should be continued; (3) it should continue to be U.S. policy to assist the international community in a review of security measures at the Simon Bolivar International Airport and to work with the Organization of American States (OAS) to bring Venezuela into compliance with OAS conventions and treaties to punish and eliminate narco-terrorism; (4) the Secretary of Transportation should report to Congress on actions taken by the government of Venezuela to restore airport security measures at such Airport; and (5) the Secretary of State should report to Congress on Venezuela's compliance with international counternarcotics treaties.</summary>
