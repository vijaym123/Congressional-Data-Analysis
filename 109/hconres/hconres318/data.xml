  <summary>12/15/2005--Introduced.
Supports strengthened economic, scientific, military, humanitarian, and anti-terrorism ties between the United States and India. States that the United States and India have a vital common interest in reducing the dangers posed by nuclear weapons through effective nonproliferation and disarmament endeavors. Expresses concern that the supply of nuclear fuel to India could result in the availability of India's existing fissile material stockpile, and in India's capacity to produce fissile material, for weapons purposes and thereby compromise U.S. ability to comply with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Finds that the proposal for full civilian nuclear cooperation between the United States and India poses potentially adverse implications for U.S. nuclear nonproliferation objectives. Disapproves of any nuclear cooperation proposal that would result in the export or transfer to any country that: (1) is not a party to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has detonated a nuclear explosive device; or (2) is a nonnuclear-weapon state under that Treaty, but has not accepted full International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards over all of its nuclear facilities, materials, equipment, or technology that could assist in nuclear weapons production.</summary>
