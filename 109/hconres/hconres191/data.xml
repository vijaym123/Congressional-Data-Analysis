  <summary>7/14/2005--Passed House amended.
Honors all veterans, living and deceased, of the Second World War in both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters on the 60th anniversary year of the war's conclusion. Expresses the deep appreciation and gratitude of the United States for their valor and selfless service to their country. Calls upon the people of the United States to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the final surrender of the Second World War aboard the USS Missouri as a day of remembrance and appreciation for those who preserved liberty for future generations and rescued the world from the scourge of fascist militarism. Reaffirms the judgment in Tokyo rendered by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East of 1946-1948 and the conviction of certain individuals as war criminals for their crimes against humanity. Recognizes that the alliances formed in the Asia-Pacific region following the Second World War, including those with Australia, Japan, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand, have contributed immeasurably to the continued peace and prosperity enjoyed throughout the region.</summary>
