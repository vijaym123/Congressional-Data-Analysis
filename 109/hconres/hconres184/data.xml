  <summary>6/22/2005--Introduced.
Expresses the the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States should accelerate Iraqi security force training, and urge the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other international organizations to take a more prominent training role; (2) the President and the Secretary of Defense should develop a comprehensive plan to deal with the problems that the U.S. military is experiencing because of high operational tempo in Iraq; and (3) the President should develop and explain to the people of the United States a strategy for success in Iraq which includes plans for quicker and more effective training of Iraqi army and police forces, and U.S. military withdrawal once Iraqi security forces are able to provide security on a self-sustaining basis.</summary>
