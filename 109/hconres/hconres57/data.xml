  <summary>2/14/2005--Introduced.
Declares that Marcus Garvey (founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association): (1) was innocent of the charges brought against him by the U.S. Government; and (2) should be recognized internationally as a leader and thinker in the struggle for human rights and dignity. Calls upon the President to endeavor to restore Marcus Garvey's honor and good name by granting a full posthumous pardon that proclaims his conviction to have been unjust and affirms his innocence.</summary>
