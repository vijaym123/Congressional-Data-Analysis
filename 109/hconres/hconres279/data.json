    "text": "Recognizes the importance of the September 2005 presidential election as a first step toward greater openness and political reforms in Egypt. Expresses concern over the lack of international election monitoring and irregularities during such election. Calls on the government of Egypt, during the 2005 parliamentary elections, to: (1) authorize the judiciary to supervise the election process; (2) authorize the presence of accredited representatives of all competing parties and independent candidates at polling stations and during the vote-counting; and (3) allow local and international election monitors full access and accreditation. Calls on the government of Egypt to: (1) separate the National Democratic Party apparatus from the operations of government, divest all government holdings in Egyptian media, and end the government newspaper monopoly; and (2) repeal the 1981 emergency law and, in the development of any future anti-terrorism legislation, allow constitutional political activities."
