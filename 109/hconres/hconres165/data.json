Calls on the Cuban Government to: (1) immediately release all political prisoners in Cuba, including Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia; (2) eliminate all of Cuba's criminal laws that unnecessarily restrict the fundamental human rights to freedom of speech, association, and movement; and (3) respect fundamental human rights and free multiparty and internationally supervised elections in Cuba."
