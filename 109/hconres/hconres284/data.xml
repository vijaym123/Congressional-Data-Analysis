  <summary>12/19/2005--Passed House amended.
Recognizes the importance of the September 2005 presidential election as a potential first step toward greater openness and political reforms in Egypt. Expresses concern over the reported irregularities during the 2005 Egyptian presidential election and parliamentary elections, including interference by Egyptian security forces, and the apparent failure of the government of Egypt to ensure free elections. Recognizes that the development of a democratically-elected representative and empowered Egyptian national parliament is a needed fundamental reform. Calls on the government of Egypt to: (1) address violations of the fundamental freedoms of the Egyptian people and hold those responsible for such violations accountable; (2) separate the National Democratic Party apparatus from the operations of government, divest all government holdings in Egyptian media, and end the government newspaper monopoly; (3) repeal the 1977 emergency law, and in the development of any future anti-terrorism legislation allow constitutional political activities; (4) ensure for future elections judicial supervision of the election process, the presence of international monitors, and the presence of representatives of all competing parties and independent candidates at polling stations and during the vote-counting; and (5) not use the strength of the Islamist opposition in Egypt to justify the government's failure to comply with its international human rights obligations or to undertake the reforms to which it has committed. Urges the President of the United States to take into account the progress achieved by the government of Egypt in meeting the goals of this resolution when determining U.S.-Egyptian diplomatic and assistance considerations. Urges the President and other U.S. government officers to clearly express the disappointment of the people and government of the United States concerning the government of Egypt's behavior during the 2005 presidential and parliamentary elections.</summary>
