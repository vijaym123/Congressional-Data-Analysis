  <summary>11/18/2005--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the European Union's unilateral attempt to alter the International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures Number 15 (ISPM 15) as it applies to imports of wood packaging materials violates the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). Urges the President to ask the European Commission to agree to: (1) suspend the requirement that all wood packaging be debarked until there is credible scientific evidence of the need for such a standard; (2) allow the processing of relevant scientific data through authorized IPPC channels; (3) develop a clear definition of "debarked" wood packaging for pallets and containers, if the relevant IPPC entities conclude that changing ISPM 15 is technically justified, and communicate it to all participating nations in a clear and unambiguous manner; (4) allow sufficient time for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to establish a system for using a "debark" mark or other stamp or indication for pallets and containers; and (5) establish an implementation date for the new requirement with which U.S. wood packaging manufacturers can reasonably comply.</summary>
