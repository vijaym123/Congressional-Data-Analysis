Calls on the government of Iran to cease repressive activities aimed at the Iranian Baha'i community and holds the government of Iran responsible for upholding the rights of its nationals, including the Baha'i community. Requests the President to: (1) call for the government of Iran to emancipate the Baha'i community by granting those rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights covenants; (2) emphasize that the United States regards the government of Iran's human rights practices as a significant factor in U.S.-Iran foreign policy; and (3) initiate a consistent dialogue with other governments and the European Union (EU) in order to persuade the government of Iran to rectify its human rights practices.</summary>
