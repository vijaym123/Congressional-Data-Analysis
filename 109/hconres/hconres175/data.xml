  <summary>11/16/2006--Passed Senate without amendment.
Recognizes: (1) African descendants for their contributions to the economic, social, and cultural fabric of the countries in the Americas, particularly in Latin American and Caribbean societies; and (2) that as a result of their skin color and ancestry such descendants have experienced economic, social, and political injustices. Urges the President to encourage the remembrance of the achievements of African descendants in the Americas and a resolution of such injustices. Encourages the United States and the international community to work to ensure that poverty is eradicated, universal education is achieved, quality healthcare is made available, environmental resources are provided, and equal access to justice is granted in Afro-descendant communities in Latin America and the Caribbean. Encourages the the United States and the international community to achieve these goals by: (1) promoting research that focuses on identifying and eradicating racial disparities in economic, political, and social spheres; (2) promoting programs that focus on Afro-descendant communities; (3) providing technical support and training to Afro-descendant advocacy groups that work to uphold basic human rights in the region; (4) promoting the creation of an international working group that focuses on problems of communities of Afro-descendants in the Americas; and (5) promoting trade and other bilateral and multilateral agreements that take into account the needs of Afro-descendant communities.</summary>
