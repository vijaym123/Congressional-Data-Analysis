  <summary>10/27/2005--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) following the tragedies of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama should adopt comprehensive, modern, and uniform statewide building codes establishing minimum standards for the construction and maintenance of buildings and other structures to mitigate against future disasters, increase public safety, and enhance such states' rebuilding; and (2) such standards should be at least as comprehensive as the International Code Council's model building standards and codes.</summary>
