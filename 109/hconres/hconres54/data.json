Expresses the sense of the Congress that any legislation specifying such fiscal responsibilities, and providing for such liability and penalties, should be at least as comprehensive in relation to such individual accounts as are requirements of certain Federal civil service law in relation to accounts maintained for Members of Congress and Federal employees under the Thrift Savings Plan."
