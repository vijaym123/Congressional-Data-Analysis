  <summary>6/7/2006--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) mathematics and science education programs across federal agencies should be better coordinated; (2) there should be minimal duplication among these programs and consistent standards of evaluation; (3) the Department of Education should be commended for its rapid response in creating the Academic Competitiveness Council; and (4) the recommendations of such Council should be closely examined when making decisions about federal funding for mathematics and science education programs.</summary>
