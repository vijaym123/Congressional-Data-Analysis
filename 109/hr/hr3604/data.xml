  <summary>7/28/2005--Introduced.
Badge and Uniform Security and Trustworthiness Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to apply prohibitions against the use of counterfeit police badges to the use of any official insignia or article of clothing (including a badge, emblem or identification card, that is an indicium of the authority of a public employee). Defines "public employee" to mean any officer or employee of the federal government or of a state or local government. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines to assure that the sentence imposed on a defendant who is convicted of a federal offense while wearing or displaying such insignia and clothing reflects the gravity of this aggravating factor.</summary>
