Defines \"public employee\" to mean any officer or employee of the federal government or of a state or local government. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines to assure that the sentence imposed on a defendant who is convicted of a federal offense while wearing or displaying such insignia and clothing reflects the gravity of this aggravating factor."
