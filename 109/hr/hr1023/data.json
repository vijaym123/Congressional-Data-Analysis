Directs the Administrator to make one annual award, unless there are no eligible discoveries or contributions, for each of the following categories: (1) the amateur astronomer or group of amateur astronomers who discovered the intrinsically brightest near-Earth asteroid among the near-Earth asteroids that were discovered by such astronomers or groups; and (2) the amateur astronomer or group of amateur astronomers who made the greatest contribution to the mission of the Minor Planet Center to catalogue near-Earth asteroids. Limits the amount of an award under such Program to $3,000. Bars any individual who is not a citizen or permanent resident of the United States at the time of such individual's discovery or contribution from receiving an award. Makes the Administrator's awards decisions under this Act final. Authorizes appropriations."
