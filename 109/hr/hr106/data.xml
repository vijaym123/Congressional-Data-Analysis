  <summary>1/4/2005--Introduced.
Neighborhood Rail Accountability Act - Amends Federal transportation law to require the Surface Transportation Board, in determining whether to issue a certificate authorizing the construction of an additional railroad line or of an extension to any railroad line, to: (1) give greater weight to local official statements and public comments in opposition to the proposed construction, especially with respect to construction in a residential area, if there is an unusually high level of public opposition; and (2) identify any disproportionate negative impacts on any socioeconomic population, including a discussion of alternatives that were considered that would have avoided such impacts. Prescribes procedural requirements for dealing with any false or incorrect information provided by a certificate applicant.</summary>
