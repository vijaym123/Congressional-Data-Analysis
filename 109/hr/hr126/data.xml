  <summary>12/1/2005--Public Law.
Increases from 100 to a minimum of 110 the number of free roaming horses the Secretary of the Interior is required to permit in Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina, with a target population of between 120 and 130. Prohibits the Secretary from removing, assisting in, or permitting the removal of any free roaming horses from Federal lands, within the boundaries of the seashore unless removal is carried out as part of a plan to maintain the viability of the herd. Prohibits anything in such law from being construed to require the Secretary to replace horses or otherwise increase the number of horses within such boundaries where the herd numbers fall below 110 (currently, 100) as a result of natural causes, including, but not limited to, disease or natural disasters.</summary>
