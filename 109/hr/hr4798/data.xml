California Perchlorate Contamination Remediation Act - Establishes the California Perchlorate Cleanup Fund. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer amounts from the Fund to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the federal share of grants to California water authorities for the cleanup of water sources and supplies contaminated by perchlorate. Directs the Administrator, in awarding such grants, to give priority to activities in the Santa Clara Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, Sacramento County, a region within the natural watershed of the Santa Ana River, and any other region that has a damaged water source contaminated with perchlorate. Authorizes the Administrator to provide grants to nonfederal entities for research and development of perchlorate remediation technologies. Urges the Administrator to establish a national drinking water standard for perchlorate.</summary>
