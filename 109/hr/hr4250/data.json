    "text": "United States Export Promotion Act of 2005 - Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce, the International Trade Administration, and the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (USFCS) from charging fees to U.S. exporters, businesses, or persons for assistance provided to them under export promotion programs. Revises the capital security cost-sharing program under the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 to exclude from determination of an agency's total overseas presence any positions or activities attributable to export promotion programs. Requires the Secretary to develop and submit to Congress plans to: (1) locate and relocate USFCS offices, officers, and employees in other countries at places other than the U.S. embassy or the U.S. chief diplomatic mission; and (2) place a USFCS office where the United States has diplomatic relations or, where viable in countries with smaller markets, one or more foreign nationals working under a regional USFCS officer's supervision to carry out export promotion functions. Directs the Secretary to develop and submit to Congress a plan for conducting at least 100 U.S. trade missions abroad in FY2006-FY2007. Requires the Secretary to: (1) increase the participation in global markets of small and medium-sized U.S. businesses; (2) review, reorganize, and expand the Department of Commerce Web site to increase its usability and scope; and (3) create a database of U.S. exporters."
