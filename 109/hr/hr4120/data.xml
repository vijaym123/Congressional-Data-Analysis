  <summary>10/20/2005--Introduced.
Passport for All Act of 2005 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate passport waiver authority for immigrant and nonimmigrant aliens and U.S. citizens (thus requiring a passport for all travel into or from the United States). Authorizes passport waiver for a U.S. citizen in individual cases of unforeseen emergency or humanitarian or national interest. Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to require (by January 1, 2008) that all U.S. citizens and aliens carry and produce a passport when traveling into the United States (except as provided by this Act). Directs the Secretary of State to endeavor to persuade all countries to issue machine-readable passports which comply with document identifying standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization.</summary>
