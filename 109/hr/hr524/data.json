Defines \"qualified water conservation property\" to include smart dual or multi program irrigation clocks, low-flow shower heads, ultra low-flush toilets, and high-efficiency clothes washing machines. Limits the amount of such credit to $1,000 for a taxable year. Allows certain small business employers (100 or fewer employees) a business tax credit for ten percent of the cost of qualified water conservation property installed in or in connection with such employer's principal place of business."
