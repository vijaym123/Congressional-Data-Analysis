Directs the Secretary of Education to study and report to Congress on the rate at which Native Americans (including Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians) and students who reside in American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam drop out of secondary schools in the United States. Requires recommendations for increasing the numbers of such students who graduate from secondary school. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report to Congress three years after enactment of this Act on the Federal programs funded during such period which were designed to decrease or otherwise address the rate at which students cease attending secondary schools in the United States before they have graduated.</summary>
