(Sec. 4) Establishes the Long Island Sound Stewardship Initiative Region within Connecticut and New York. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to designate as a stewardship site any area that contributes to accomplishing the purpose of this Act. Requires the Administrator to provide: (1) a public comment period on the list of sites recommended by the Long Island Sound Stewardship Advisory Committee (established by this Act); and (2) an opportunity for owners of such sites to decline designation. Prohibits the Administrator from designating an area as a stewardship site unless the owner of the area is provided, and acknowledges the receipt of, an opinion of the owner's responsibility that arises from such designation.
