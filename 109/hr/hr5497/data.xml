  <summary>5/25/2006--Introduced.
Prohibits the Secretary of the Air Force from reducing the number of personnel (including contractors) assigned to the Air Force Space Command (or any component of that Command), from the number assigned to the Command as of January 1, 2006, until the Secretary submits to specified congressional committees a report that includes: (1) a description of, and justification for, the proposed reduction; (2) assessments of the reduction's effects, including whether they could be mitigated by allowing greater flexibility in resource decisions; and (3) a certification that the proposed reduction will not diminish or interfere with U.S. national security space acquisition programs, operations, or technology development.</summary>
