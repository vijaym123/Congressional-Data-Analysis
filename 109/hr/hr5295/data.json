Requires search measures to be reasonably related to search objectives, without being excessively intrusive in light of the nature of the offense and the student's age and sex. Denies Safe and Drug Free School funds, provided under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, to local educational agencies that fail to comply with this Act."
