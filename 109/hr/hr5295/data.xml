  <summary>9/19/2006--Passed House amended.
Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 - Requires local educational agencies to have in effect policies that deem to be reasonable and permissible a search of any minor student on public school grounds if conducted by a full-time teacher or school official, acting on any reasonable suspicion based on professional experience and judgment, to ensure that the school and students remain free from the threat of all weapons, dangerous materials, or illegal narcotics. Requires search measures to be reasonably related to search objectives, without being excessively intrusive in light of the nature of the offense and the student's age and sex. Denies Safe and Drug Free School funds, provided under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, to local educational agencies that fail to comply with this Act.</summary>
