Requires the Secretary to publish such findings in the Federal Register. Ratifies and approves the Jicarilla Apache Nation's quitclaim deed for the settlement lands to the County, but such ratification and approval shall be effective only upon satisfaction of all conditions specified above and only as of the date that the Secretary's findings are published in the Federal Register. Requires the Secretary to issue to the County a patent for the settlement lands. Subjects the patent to all valid existing rights of third parties, including but not limited to easements of record. Requires that the patent include a specified perpetual restrictive covenant running with the Settlement Lands for the benefit of the lands comprising the Jicarilla Apache Reservation adjacent to the Settlement Lands. Provides that the lands conveyed to the County in such patent shall cease to be a part of the Jicarilla Apache Reservation and the exterior boundary of the Reservation shall be deemed relocated accordingly."
