  <summary>1/25/2005--Introduced.
Angolan Temporary Protected Status Act of 2005 - Expresses the sense of Congress that Angola qualifies for designation under the Immigration and Nationality Act as a nation with an ongoing conflict pursuant to which Angolan nationals would be eligible for temporary protected status (TPS) in the United States. Amends the Act to so designate Angola for an initial one-year period. Sets forth TPS eligibility requirements for Angolan nationals, including: (1) continuous physical presence in the United States since the date of enactment of this Act; (2) admissibility as an immigrant (with certain exceptions) and eligibility for TPS; and (3) registration for TPS in a manner established by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Requires the Secretary to give prior consent to such aliens for brief, temporary trips abroad in emergency and extenuating circumstances.</summary>
