Directs the Secretary of Education to allot funds to States for distribution to local educational agencies (LEAs) to recruit, hire, and train 100,000 new classroom paraprofessionals in order to improve educational achievement for children. Requires that 80 percent of a State's allotment be allocated to LEAs on the basis of relative numbers of children from families with incomes below the poverty line residing in LEAs' school districts, and that the remainder be allocated on the basis of relative enrollments.</summary>
