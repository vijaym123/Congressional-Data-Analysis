  <summary>9/13/2006--Introduced.
Clean Contracting Act - Requires the revision of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to restrict the contract period of noncompetitive federal contracts in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold ($100,000) to the minimum contract period necessary to: (1) meet the urgent and compelling requirements of the work to be performed; and (2) enter into another contract for the required goods and services through the use of competitive procedures. Requires: (1) FAR to be revised to require competition in the purchase of goods and services by executive agencies pursuant to multiple award contracts; and (2) Secretary of Defense to revise the Department of Defense Supplement to FAR to cover purchases of goods by the Department of Defense (DOD) pursuant to such contracts. Prohibits the award of monopoly contracts (as defined). Requires: (1) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to report on interagency acquisitions; and (2) revision of Appendix B of OMB Circular A-123 for preventing abuse of government credit cards. Requires federal agencies and departments to submit quarterly reports to Congress on: (1) certain excessive government contractor costs; and (2) significant or substantial deficiencies in the performance of any contractor or any contractor's business system. Requires executive agencies to make specified contractor information publicly available. Requires the House Committee on Government Reform or its subcommittees to hold hearings to investigate credible evidence or allegations of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in federal contracts.</summary>
