Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require the President, through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), to provide assistance to reduce poverty and foster increased economic opportunity in the Western Hemisphere by: (1) nurturing public-private partnerships and microenterprise development; (2) improving the quality of life and investing in human capital; (3) strengthening the rule of law through improved efficiency and transparency in government services; and (4) reducing poverty and eliminating the exclusion of marginalized populations. Establishes a project review committee. Amends the Inter-American Development Bank Act to require the Secretary of the Treasury to urge the Bank to establish an account to be operated consistent with the above guidelines. Establishes a technical review committee. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Western Hemisphere countries should collectively provide assistance equal to the amount of U.S. bilateral and multilateral assistance."
