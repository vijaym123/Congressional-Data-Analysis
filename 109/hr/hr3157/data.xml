  <summary>6/30/2005--Introduced.
Currency Manipulation Prevention Act - Amends the Trade Act of 2002 to state that the principal negotiating objective of the United States with respect to currency exchange rates is to ensure that governmental intervention in currency markets is of limited duration and is carried out in consultation with countries with major trading partners. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to submit biannual reports: (1) describing actions by foreign governments to manipulate their currencies to increase their exports and to limit imports from the United States; (2) analyzing the impact of such currency manipulation on the U.S. manufacturing sector and on U.S. monetary policy; and (3) setting forth remedies against such currency manipulation. Directs the President to: (1) negotiate with any country identified by the Secretary of Commerce as engaging in currency manipulation to end such practice; and (2) seek compensation from such country (if in the national interest) for the damages incurred by U.S. manufacturers.</summary>
