  <summary>4/27/2006--Introduced.
Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to require representatives of governments designated by the Secretary of State as State Sponsors of Terrorism (covered foreign principals) to disclose to the Attorney General lobbying contacts with legislative branch officials. Prohibits the Secretary from recognizing as accredited a diplomatic or consular officer of a covered foreign principal unless the officer agrees to comply with this Act. Requires the Attorney General to make such information available to the general public in an electronic format.</summary>
