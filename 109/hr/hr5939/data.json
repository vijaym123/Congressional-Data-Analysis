    "text": "Criminal Terrorism Improvements Act of 2006 - Amends the federal criminal code to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment on individuals who cause the death of a person while committing a terrorist act. Authorizes the death penalty for: (1) developing, possessing, or threatening to use radiological weapons against a person or against U.S. property; (2) causing the death of an individual by using missile systems designed to destroy aircraft, by using radiological dispersal devices, or by using the variola virus; and (3) use of atomic weapons with intent to injure the United States. Increases criminal penalties for: (1) attempting or conspiring to kill a U.S. national; (2) engaging in physical violence with the intent to injure a U.S. national; (3) financing terrorism or concealing assets to be used for terrorist activities; and (4) providing material support to terrorists or receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization. Amends the crime of receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization to include attempts or conspiracies to receive such training. Denies certain federal benefits to individuals convicted of a federal crime of terrorism. Expands the authorization for interception of communications (wiretapping) to include all federal crimes of terrorism."
