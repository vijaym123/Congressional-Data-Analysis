  <summary>4/4/2006--Introduced.
American Broadband for Communities Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize the use of any unused broadcast television spectrum in the band between 54 and 698 megaHertz, other than between 608 and 614 megaHertz, by unlicensed devices, including wireless broadband devices. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) adopt minimal technical and device rules to develop the use of such spectrum by such unlicensed devices; and (2) establish specified rules and procedures, including to protect incumbent licensed services from harmful interference from such unlicensed devices, and to address complaints from licensed broadcast stations that an unlicensed device using such spectrum causes harmful interference.</summary>
