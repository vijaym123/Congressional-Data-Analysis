    "text": "Coastal Economic and Environmental Protection Act - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to revise the determination of adjacent zones and planning areas in the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Prescribes guidelines for: (1) lease administration; (2) lease grants; (3) lease receipts ; and (4) allocations to states and coastal municipal political subdivisions. Modifies review guidelines for OCS exploration plans and drilling permits. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to include in each five-year program lease sales that offer at least 75% of the available unleased acreage within each OCS Planning Area for oil and gas or natural gas leasing. Revises requirements for review of OCS development and production plans. Establishes the Federal Energy Natural Resources Enhancement Fund. Declares without force or effect all provisions of existing federal law that prohibit spending appropriated funds for OCS oil and natural gas leasing and preleasing. Prohibits a federal agency from permitting certain activities on federal OCS or in state waters that are incompatible with either oil or natural gas leasing, or with exploration and production of tracts that are geologically prospective for oil or natural gas. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to revise regulation of surface-disturbing activities. Redesignates the Minerals Management Service as the National Ocean Resources and Royalty Service. Rigs to Reefs Act of 2005 - Amends the OCSLA to prescribe requirements for the use of decommissioned offshore oil and gas platforms for mariculture, artificial reef, and scientific research. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal the requirement for: (1) a comprehensive inventory of OCS oil and natural gas resources; and (2) payments for oil shale and tar sands leases. Prescribes implementation guidelines for leasing areas located within 125 miles of California or Florida. Amends the OCSLA to repeal the coastal impact assistance program."
