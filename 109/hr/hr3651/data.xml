  <summary>9/6/2005--Introduced.
Authorizes the use of arbitration to settle a dispute, notwithstanding an employment contract that provides for the use of arbitration to resolve a controversy arising out of or relating to the employment relationship, only if: (1) the employer or employee submits a written request after the dispute arises to the other party to use arbitration; and (2) the other party consents in writing within 60 days after receipt of the request. Prohibits an employer subject to federal arbitration provisions from requiring an employee to arbitrate a dispute as a condition of employment.</summary>
