Increases from $250,000 to $400,000 the maximum coverage amount under the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program. Provides retroactive applicability of such increase with respect to members who died in the performance of duty between the period beginning on October 1, 2000, and ending 120 days after the enactment of this Act and who, on the date of death, were insured for the maximum coverage available."
