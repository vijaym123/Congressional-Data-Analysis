  <summary>7/28/2006--Introduced.
Child Soldier Prevention Act of 2006 - Defines "child soldier." States that Congress condemns the conscription, forced recruitment, or use of children by governments, paramilitaries, or other organizations in hostilities. Prohibits, with a national interest waiver, funds appropriated or otherwise made available for specified military and related uses from being obligated or otherwise made available to the government of a country identified by the Department of State as having governmental armed forces or government supported armed groups, including paramilitaries, militias, or civil defense forces, that recruit or use child soldiers. Directs the Secretary of State to notify any government so identified. Authorizes the President to reinstate assistance upon certifying to Congress that a government is implementing: (1) compliance measures; and (2) mechanisms to prohibit future placement of children in combat roles and to ensure that no children are recruited before the age of 16 years old or forcibly recruited or conscripted before the age of 18 years old. Authorizes the President to provide assistance to a country for international military education and training otherwise prohibited under this Act upon certifying to Congress that such assistance is for programs that directly address the child soldier problem. States that the Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs shall coordinate U.S. policy on child soldier issues.</summary>
