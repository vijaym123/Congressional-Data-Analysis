    "text": "Disaster Relief Volunteer Protection Act of 2006 - Provides liability protection for individuals who volunteer to assist victims of national disasters for any injury (including personal injury, property damage or loss, and death) caused by an act or omission in connection with disaster relief services provided or facilitated by the volunteer, if: (1) the injury was not caused by willful, wanton, or reckless misconduct; and (2) the injury was not caused by the volunteer's operating a motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which the state requires the operator or the owner to possess an operator's license or maintain insurance. Extends such liability protection to: (1) the volunteer's employer, host, or enabling person, entity, or organization; (2) nonprofit organizations providing or facilitating disaster relief services; or (3) governmental or intergovernmental entity that donates disaster relief goods to a U.S. agency or instrumentality for any injury caused by such donated goods. Prohibits the award of punitive damages in any civil action against a disaster relief volunteer or governmental or intergovernmental entity, unless willful, wanton, or reckless misconduct is established by clear and convincing evidence. Provides for proportionate liability for noneconomic damages."
