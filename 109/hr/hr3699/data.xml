Federal and District of Columbia Government Real Property Act of 2006 - Title I: Real Property Conveyances Between the General Services Administration and the District of Columbia - (Sec. 101) Directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to convey to the District of Columbia U.S. Reservation 13, subject to specified conditions, and the Old Naval Hospital, on the day on which the District conveys to GSA certain real property on the West Campus of Saint Elizabeths Hospital. (Sec. 102) Terminates any pending District claim against the United States for failure to perform or to reimburse the District for the cost of performing specified services concerning Saint Elizabeths Hospital and the District of Columbia Mental Health Services. Title II: Streamlining Management of Properties Located in the District of Columbia - (Sec. 201) Transfers administrative jurisdiction over certain conveyed properties from the District to the Secretary of the Interior for administration by the Director of the National Park Service (NPS). Retains for the District administrative jurisdiction over the subsurface area beneath a specified parcel. Transfers administrative jurisdiction over other specified properties from the United States to the District. Requires certain property to be used as the site for the establishment of a memorial to honor disabled veterans of the U.S. armed forces authorized to be established by the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation. (Sec. 202) Conveys specified properties: (1) by the District to the Secretary, to be administered by NPs for the closure of a one-block long roadway adjacent to Montrose Park, and for the closing of the rights-of-way now occupied by the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal; and (2) by the Secretary to the District upon such conveyance. (Sec. 203) Requires the Secretary to convey U.S. Reservation 174 to the District upon the District's enactment of a final plan that meets specified requirements for the development of the former Convention Center Site. (Sec. 204) Requires the District, before the Secretary conveys to it U.S. Reservation 13, to convey (with the approval of the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) and under specified conditions) up to 12 acres of real property to the AOC. Prohibits the AOC from constructing a mail screening facility on such real property unless certain conditions are met, including an analysis of: (1) whether other underutilized, surplus, or excess federal facilities exist in which such a screening facility could be more economically located; and (2) whether the Senate and the House should share a single mail screening facility. Title III: Poplar Point - (Sec. 301) Requires NPs, upon certification by the Secretary (acting through NPs), to convey Poplar Point to the District after the District adopts a land-use plan for it meeting specified requirements. Requires the deed for such conveyance to include a restriction requiring that 70 acres be maintained for park purposes in perpetuity. (Sec. 303) Provides for conveyance: (1) from the District to NPs at no cost of certain replacement facilities and properties to which NPs is to be relocated; and (2) from NPs to the District of certain other properties withheld from the conveyance of Poplar Point. Title IV: General Provisions - (Sec. 402) Declares that the United States shall not be responsible for paying costs and expenses, other than those related to or associated with environmental liabilities or cleanup actions provided under law, which are incurred by the District or any other parties in connection with effecting the provisions of this Act or amendments made by it. (Sec. 403) Authorizes a federal or District officer or employee to contract for payment of costs or expenses related to any properties which are conveyed or for which administrative jurisdiction is transferred under this Act. (Sec. 404) Declares that nothing in this Act may be construed to affect or limit the application of or obligation to comply with any environmental law, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. (Sec. 405) Requires the Mayor of the District to report annually to specified congressional committees on the use and development during the previous year of land for which title is conveyed to the District and land for which administrative jurisdiction is transferred to it pursuant to this Act. Requires the Comptroller General to report periodically to such congressional committees on: (1) the use and development during the previous two years of such land; and (2) if applicable, how such use and development complies with the Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan referred to in the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation Act of 2004. Terminates such reporting requirements 10 years after the enactment of this Act. (Sec. 406) Subjects any properties conveyed to, or whose administrative jurisdiction over is transferred, to the AOC to federal laws relating to: (1) policing of U.S. Capitol Grounds; and (2) prohibited acts within such Grounds. (Sec. 407) Requires the Mayor of the District, the Administrator of GSA, or the Secretary (as the case may be) to execute and deliver a quitclaim deed or prepare and record a transfer plat, as appropriate, within six months after each property is conveyed. (Sec. 408) Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) report to Congress, within six months after the enactment of this Act, on surplus and excess government property; (2) develop and implement procedures requiring federal agencies to share data on such surplus and excess real property under the jurisdiction of each agency; and (3) report to Congress on the development and implementation of such procedures.</summary>
