Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to: (1) expand and coordinate NIH cancer survivorship research activities; (2) establish a Division of Cancer Survivorship within NCI; and (3) provide for the expansion of cancer survivorship research activities at NCI-designated cancer centers. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to: (1) expand the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program; (2) study the unique health challenges associated with cancer survivorship; and (3) carry out projects and interventions to improve the long-term health status of cancer survivors. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish programs that demonstrate how to prevent and control cancer and improve access to quality cancer care among racial and ethnic minorities and medically underserved populations with disproportionate incidence of, or death from, cancer; (2) promote cancer education, prevention, and early detection of cancer; (3) award grants for cancer control and prevention; and (4) establish the National Commission on Cancer Survivorship. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Directors of CDC and NCI, to make grants to monitor and evaluate the quality of cancer care, develop information concerning the quality of care, and monitor cancer survivorship.</summary>
