  <summary>7/26/2006--Introduced.
Refugee Ecology Protection, Assistance, and Immediate Response Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide under the Refuge Ecology Protection, Assistance, and Immediate Response Grant Program or the REPAIR Program (established by this Act): (1) a grant to any eligible applicant to carry out a qualified control project to control harmful nonnative species; and (2) a grant to any state to carry out an assessment project to identify harmful nonnative species, assess the needs to restore, manage, or enhance native fish, wildlife and habitats, identify priorities, and identify mechanisms to increase capacity building for native fish, wildlife, and habitats. Requires the Secretary to consult with the Invasive Species Advisory Committee on: (1) the projects proposed for such grants; and (2) regarding the development of a database concerning control projects carried out with such grants. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to enable an immediate response to outbreaks of harmful nonnative species that threaten or may negatively impact refuge resources that are at a stage at which rapid eradication or control is possible, and to ensure eradication or immediate control of such species. Directs the Secretary to establish a Cooperative Volunteer Invasives Monitoring and Control Program to document and combat invasive species in national wildlife refuges.</summary>
