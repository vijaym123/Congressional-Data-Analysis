Declares that it is not in order in the Senate or the House of Representatives to consider any direct spending or revenue legislation that would decrease a unified-budget surplus or cause or increase a unified-budget deficit. Makes exceptions for legislation affecting full funding of deposit insurance guarantee commitments, and for periods of war or recession. Requires all Treasury securities to bear a facsimile of the signatures of the President and the Secretary of the Treasury.</summary>
