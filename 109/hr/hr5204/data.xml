  <summary>4/26/2006--Introduced.
Federal Locks and Lock and Dam Facilities Act of 2006 - Declares that: (1) water and navigational resource projects and facilities are national critical infrastructures and the operation and maintenance of locks and lock and dam facilities constitute inherently governmental functions that require performance by federal employees; and (2) the transfer of such functions to a different agency shall not change such determination. Permits the Army Corps of Engineers to continue to contract: (1) for private sector performance of such functions that were performed under contracts with the private sector in effect on March 1, 2006, but permits the Corps to use federal employees to perform such functions in the future; and (2) with the private sector to construct new locks and lock and dam facilities.</summary>
