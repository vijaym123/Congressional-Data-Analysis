Rural Veterans Services Outreach Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make grants for financial assistance to eligible counties to assist in the employment of county veterans service officers. Limits grant amounts to $12,000 for a 12-month period. Defines as an eligible county a county: (1) in which not less than 1,000 veterans reside; (2) in which no more than one veterans service organization provides advice and casework services for veterans' benefits; and (3) which consists entirely outside of territory classified as an urban area. Expresses the sense of Congress that appropriate officials in counties with one or more county veterans service officers should encourage and facilitate such officer(s) in obtaining certification with respect to professional qualifications to perform such functions.</summary>
