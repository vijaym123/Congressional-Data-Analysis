Preventive Medicine for a Healthier America Act of 2006 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay up to $20,000 of the medical education loans incurred by any physician who receives board certification in preventive medicine from FY2007-FY2011. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for a wellness program tax credit for employers that develop and implement a program that provides: (1) at least two preventive health screenings for employees; and (2) counseling, seminars, self-help materials, and other resources related to preventive health. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), to carry out a national education campaign to encourage the use of preventive health screenings.</summary>
