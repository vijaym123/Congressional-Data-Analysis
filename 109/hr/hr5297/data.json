    "text": "Improving Access to Medicare Part D Act of 2006 - Amends part C (Medicare+Choice) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to provide for a one-year extension until May 15, 2007, of the 2006 initial enrollment period for Medicare prescription drug benefits and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Extends through May 14, 2007, the current extended period of continuous open enrollment and disenrollment. Amends part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of SSA title XVIII to repeal the prohibition against interference by the Secretary of Health and Human Services with prescription drug price negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsors. Authorizes the Secretary to negotiate prescription drug price contracts with manufacturers of covered part D drugs in order to ensure that each enrollee under a PDP or an MA-PD plan pays the lowest possible price. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should conduct (and improve current) activities, with respect to individuals eligible for the Medicare prescription drug benefits, to: (1) raise the awareness and improve the education of such individuals about such benefits; (2) improve and enhance outreach and enrollment assistance; and (3) provide for the accessibility of appropriate experts (at national, state, and local levels) to ensure that such individuals understand the benefits for which they are eligible."
