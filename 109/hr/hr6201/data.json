    "text": "Budget and Transparency Act - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the Rules of the House of Representatives to require biennial budget resolutions, appropriations Acts, and government strategic and performance plans, with the biennium beginning on October 1 of any odd-numbered year. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to report to Congress on the impact and feasibility of changing to a two-year fiscal period. Makes it out of order in the House or Senate to consider: (1) any reported bills or conference reports if the accompanying reports or joint statements include earmarks or tax earmarks; or (3) any reported bills whose accompanying reports do not list each earmark in the bills and its sponsor's name. Makes it out of order in the House or Senate to consider a bill carrying a tax measure reported by the Committee on Ways and Means or the Committee on Finance in which the Joint Committee on Taxation has: (1) identified a tax earmark unless the report includes a list of tax earmarks in it (and the names of the requesting Members); or (2) failed to provide such analysis. Requires the Joint Committee to: (1) review any such reported bill containing a tax measure; (2) identify whether it contains any tax earmarks; and (3) provide the reporting Committee with a statement identifying such earmarks or declaring that the legislation does not contain any. Allows a point of order to be made by any Member in the House or the Senate against consideration of a conference report that includes any earmark or tax earmark not committed to conference by either chamber."
