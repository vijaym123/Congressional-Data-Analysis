Prohibits: (1) the transfer of a semiautomatic assault weapon with a large capacity ammunition feeding device; and (2) a licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer who transfers such a device that was manufactured on or before enactment of this Act to fail to certify to the Attorney General (before the end of the 60-day period that begins with the date of transfer) that the device was manufactured on or before the enactment date. Sets penalties for violations."
