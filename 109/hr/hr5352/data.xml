Certified Development Company Program Act - Requires certified development companies (CDCs) which elect not to apply for authority to foreclose and liquidate defaulted loans guaranteed by the SBA, or which the SBA Administrator determines to be ineligible for such authority, to contract with a qualified third party to perform such foreclosures and liquidation. Provides additional authorities for CDCs to aid small businesses, including additional equity, debt refinancing, and lowering of loan fees. Provides criteria under which state and local development companies may qualify as CDCs. Small Business Lending Improvement Act - Authorizes the Administrator to establish a National Preferred Lenders Program. Increases maximum loan amounts for small businesses.

Vocational and Technical Entrepreneurship Development Act - Directs the Administrator to establish a program of grants to state SBDCs for the provision of technical assistance to secondary, vocational, or technical schools for the development and implementation of curricula designed to promote vocational and technical entrepreneurship. Provides SBDC outreach, development, and small business enhancement assistance to Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Second-Stage Small Business Development Act - Establishes a pilot program of grants for second-stage (high-growth) small businesses for the development of peer learning opportunities.
