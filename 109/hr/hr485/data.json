Prescribes implementation guidelines under which fifty percent of such royalties, together with interest earned from the date of payment, shall be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury to the payor of the royalties to be used solely for land reclamation purposes. Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to report to Congress on the effects of the royalty reduction, including a recommendation on whether the reduced royalty rate for potassium from sylvite should apply after the end of the five-year period. Title II: Soda Ash Royalty Reduction - Soda Ash Royalty Reduction Act of 2005 - (Sec. 202) Sets at 2.0 percent the royalty rate on the quantity or gross value of the output of sodium compounds and related products at the point of shipment to market from Federal land in the five-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act. Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to report to Congress on the effects of the royalty reduction, including: (1) the amount of sodium compounds and related products at the point of shipment to market from Federal land at the end of the four-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act; (2) the number of jobs created or maintained during the royalty reduction period; (3) the total amount of royalty paid to the United States on the quantity or gross value of the output of sodium compounds and related products at the point of shipment to market produced during that four year period, and the portion of such royalty paid to States; and (4) a recommendation of whether the reduced royalty rate should apply after the end of the five-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act."
