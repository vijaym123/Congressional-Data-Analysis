Earmark Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006 - Prohibits a federal agency from obligating funds made available in an appropriation Act or other Act to implement an earmark: (1) that is included in a congressional report accompanying such legislation, unless the earmark is also included in the Act; or (2) if the earmark was not in the House-passed or Senate-passed version of that measure committed to the conference committee. Amends rule XXII (House and Senate Relations) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit consideration of a bill or amendment between the chambers or conference report on such bill unless a list of all earmarks in it, an identification of the Member who proposed it (if possible), and an explanation of the essential governmental purpose for the earmark are available to all Members, and made available to the general public on the Internet for at least 72 hours before its consideration.</summary>
