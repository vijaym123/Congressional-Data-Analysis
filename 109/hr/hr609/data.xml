Title I: General Provisions - (Sec. 101) Establishes a single definition of institution of higher education (IHE) for purposes of participation in all HEA programs, including title IV student aid programs. (As a consequence, the 90/10 rule under title IV, which currently applies only to for-profit IHEs, would apply to public and nonprofit IHEs as well. See section 487 of this Act, which applies the rule to all IHEs and revises its enforcement.) Provides, under such single definition, for continued title IV eligibility of IHEs that: (1) have dual enrollments for secondary school students; or (2) admit home-schooled students. Revises provisions for IHEs outside the United States. Requires such IHEs to be legally authorized by the education ministry or comparable agency of the foreign country where they are located. Eliminates the requirement that students attending Canadian medical schools take the foreign medical exam. Directs the Secretary, with respect to foreign medical schools qualifying for participation in the title IV part B Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, to publish qualifying criteria by regulation. (Continues requirements for an advisory panel of medical experts to evaluate the standards of foreign medical school accreditation and determine their comparability to U.S. standards.)

(Sec. 108) Revises requirements for higher education consumer information and public accountability. Sets forth requirements for redesign of the College Opportunity On-Line (COOL) website and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. Directs the Secretary to publish a college consumer profile for each IHE participating in title IV programs. Directs the Secretary to establish a college affordability index and report to consumers on IHEs that exceed the index by certain amounts in certain periods.
