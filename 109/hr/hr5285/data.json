    "text": "Gas Tax Equity Act of 2006 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to suspend the excise tax on gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene for a 60-day period beginning after the enactment of this Act (suspension period). Requires reimbursement to the Highway Trust Fund and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund for tax revenues lost during the suspension period. Expresses the sense of Congress that the reduction of taxes under this Act should immediately benefit consumers. Repeals provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 relating to: (1) the program on oil and gas royalties in-kind; (2) incentives for natural gas production from deep wells in the Gulf of Mexico; (3) suspension of royalty payments under federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and the Outer Continental Shelf; and (4) exploration incentives in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Requires certain integrated oil companies (defined as having an average daily worldwide crude oil production level of at least 500,000 barrels and more than $1 billion in gross receipts in 2005) to revalue their LIFO inventories of crude oil, natural gas, or other petroleum products according to a specified formula. Denies such oil companies: (1) two-year amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures; and (2) foreign tax credits for payments to certain foreign countries from which such oil companies receive a specified economic benefit as a dual capacity taxpayer."
