Authorizes additional appropriations beginning in FY2006 for Voice of America and RFE/RL, Incorporated to expand radio broadcasting in languages spoken in Central Asia. Conditions certain assistance, including military assistance (but excluding refugee, disaster relief, food and medicine, and HIV/AIDS assistance) to a Central Asian government upon presidential certification to the appropriate congressional committees that such government meets specified requirements respecting: (1) democratization; (2) freedom of expression and the media; (3) freedom of religion, association, and the right of peaceful assembly; (4) prevention of torture; and (5) rule of law and nondiscrimination. Withholds assistance for failure to meet such requirements at 33% for the first fiscal year, 66% for the second fiscal year, and 100% (with a national security waiver for less than 100% withholding) for the third and subsequent fiscal years. Authorizes withheld amounts to be used for democracy assistance under this Act."
