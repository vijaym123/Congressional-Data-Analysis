Permits amendment or revision of the list as necessary. Prohibits the use of pre-approved management practices for specified road construction and timber harvesting activities. Permits the Secretary concerned to use specified emergency consultative procedures in order to comply with the Endangered Species Act in the case of a proposed use of a pre-approved management practice included on the list. Requires, at the conclusion of the consultation, the issuance of a specified statement for any incidental taking that may occur while using such practice. Sets forth requirements for: (1) additional consultation; (2) the decision document; (3) implementation of such practice immediately after issuance of the decision; and (4) third-party monitoring.

(Sec. 105) Provides that, if the Secretary concerned determines to utilize the emergency procedures under section 102 of this Act to conduct a recovery project or research project such Secretary need not study, develop, or describe more than the proposed agency action and the alternative of no action in designing that project for which the emergency procedures are utilized. Prohibits the use of emergency procedures under this Act for use for specified road construction and timber harvesting activities. Permits the Secretary concerned to use specified emergency consultative procedures in order to comply with the Endangered Species Act in the case of a catastrophic recovery project or catastrophic event research project when emergency procedures are used.
