(Sec. 3) Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to provide grants to, or enter into cooperative or other agreements with, tribal, state, and local governmental entities and the Associated Ditch Companies, Incorporated (ADC) (nonprofit corporation that operates the Wallowa Lake Dam) to plan, design, and construct facilities needed to implement the Wallowa Lake Dam Rehabilitation Program. Directs the Secretary, as a condition of providing funds, to ensure that: (1) the Rehabilitation Program meets the standards of the dam safety program of Oregon; (2) ADC agrees to assume liability for any work performed or supervised with federal funds provided to it under this section; and (3) the United States shall not be liable for damages arising out of any act relating to a facility rehabilitated or constructed with federal funds provided under this Act, both while and after activities are conducted using such funds. Limits the federal share of the cost of activities authorized under this section to 50%. Prohibits the federal government from holding title to, or being responsible for the operation and maintenance of, any facility rehabilitated or constructed under this section. Authorizes appropriations. Terminates the Secretary's authority to carry out this section 10 years after its enactment.
