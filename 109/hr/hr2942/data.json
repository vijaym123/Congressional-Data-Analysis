Increases the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for repeat sex offenses to life imprisonment unless the death penalty is imposed. Prohibits a term of imprisonment imposed for sex offenses from running concurrently with any other term of imprisonment for such an offense. Increases penalties, and sets a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, for coercing or enticing any individual to travel in interstate or foreign commerce to engage in prostitution or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. Doubles the minimum and maximum terms of imprisonment for subsequent offenses. Prohibits a term of imprisonment imposed for sex offenses from running concurrently with any other term of imprisonment for such an offense."
