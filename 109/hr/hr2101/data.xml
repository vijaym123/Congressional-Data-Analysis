  <summary>5/4/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and implement an emergency telephonic alert notification system (the Responsive Emergency Alert and Dissemination of Information Call System or READICall System) to: (1) alert persons of imminent or current hazardous events caused by terrorist acts, other man-made disasters, natural disasters, or any combination of such events; and (2) provide information to individuals regarding measures to alleviate or minimize threats to their safety and welfare. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make use of national private sector networks, technology, personnel, and infrastructure to develop and implement the System; (2) develop coordinated infrastructure for the System that will be able to provide immediate notification and warning to all telephone subscribers in the United States in a national crisis resulting from a terrorist act and to target specific locations and warn just the affected areas; and (3) collaborate with other Federal, State, and local agencies to allow interoperability between different sources of terrorist threat information, allow the immediate dissemination of information from all levels of governmental sources, and develop standards, protocols, procedures, and terminology to minimize inconsistencies and miscommunication with intelligence information. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct research and pilot programs as may be necessary for improving the effectiveness of such System.</summary>
