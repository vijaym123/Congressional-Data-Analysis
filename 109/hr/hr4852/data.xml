Directs the Secretary of Education to encourage states, during the three-year period beginning upon enactment of this Act, to place a moratorium on the administration of all standardized tests. Requires each state desiring to receive a grant under ESEA title I part A, beginning after such three-year period, to report annually to the Secretary on all standardized tests administered to elementary or secondary students in the state.</summary>
