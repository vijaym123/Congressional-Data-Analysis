Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita Act of 2005 - Provides vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities affected by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita. Directs the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration, in realloting amounts to states under certain provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (RA), to give preference to affected states that contain an area, or that received a significant number of individuals who resided in an area, in which the President has declared that a major disaster exists. Authorizes waiver of nonfederal share requirements in specified circumstances. Allows an affected state to use such reallotted funds for FY2005 to: (1) pay for vocational rehabilitation services for such individuals that contribute to economic growth and development of communities; (2) enable such individuals to participate in reconstruction or other major disaster assistance activities in the areas in which the individuals resided on certain dates; (3) pay for vocational rehabilitation services for such individuals who do not meet the affected state's order of selection criteria under RA; or (4) carry out other activities in accordance with title I of RA."
