  <summary>7/21/2005--Introduced.
Guardianship Assistance Promotion and Kinship Support Act - Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to allow each state with an approved part E plan to enter into negotiated agreements to provide legal guardianship assistance payments (based on foster care maintenance payments) to individuals who have assumed legal guardianship of children for whom they have cared as foster parents and for whom they have committed to care on a permanent basis. Prohibits a legal guardianship assistance payment from being made with respect to a child who has attained 18 years of age, with certain exceptions such as for a child who is a full-time student in a secondary school. Authorizes the use of foster care independence program funds to provide independent living services, education and training vouchers, and room and board for children who exit foster care to guardianship or adoption after attaining age 14. Expands the definition of family support services to include assisting kinship caregivers or guardians in locating and accessing needed services. Allows state authorities to establish and maintain separate standards for foster family homes in which a foster parent is a relative of the foster child that, at a minimum, protect the safety of the child and provide for criminal records checks. Provides for: (1) notice to relatives when children enter foster care; and (2) expansion of eligibility for the foster care independence program. Allows the Secretary to make grants to eligible entities to pay for the federal share of the cost of carrying out kinship navigator programs to help connect kinship caregivers with necessary services and assistance.</summary>
