Provides for the calculation of losses and payments. Directs the Secretary to use necessary CCC funds to make emergency financial assistance to commercial ornamental nursery and fernery producers in a disaster county to help cover debris removal and associated costs due to any of those hurricanes. Amends the: (1) Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 to include a producer of nursery or fernery crops within the term \"agricultural producer\" for purposes of its emergency conservation program; and (2) Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to include nursery growers that produce field- or container-grown trees within the term \"eligible orchardist\" for purposes of its tree assistance program. Designates amounts provided under this Act as an emergency requirement under the FY2006 Concurrent Budget Resolution."
