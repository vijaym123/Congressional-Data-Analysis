Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to waive this requirement: (1) when necessary for the good of the service; (2) in cases where the proposed promotion is based primarily upon scientific and technical qualifications for which Guard or Reserve requirements do not exist; (3) in the case of specified medical, chaplaincy, or judge advocate positions; or (4) if the officer selected for appointment to brigadier general by a promotion board had completed at least 180 days of a Guard or Reserve duty assignment on the date such board was convened. Requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act that specifically identify those categories of officers for whom the waiver applicable to scientific and technical qualifications is available."
