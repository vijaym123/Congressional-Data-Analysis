    "text": "Consumer Notification and Financial Data Protection Act of 2005 - Declares that each financial institution has an obligation to maintain reasonable policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of a consumer's sensitive financial personal information against any unauthorized use that is reasonably likely to result in harm or substantial inconvenience to such consumer. Prescribes procedural guidelines, including: (1) investigation and notice procedures to alert regulators, law enforcement officials, and consumers in case of data security breaches; (2) mitigation procedures that offer free nationwide file monitoring for affected consumers; and (3) a safe harbor from liability for a financial institution in compliance with this Act. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate regulations requiring a financial institution which maintains or possesses sensitive financial personal information for a business purpose to dispose of it so that it cannot practicably be read or reconstructed. Preempts comparable state law."
