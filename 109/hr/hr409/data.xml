  <summary>12/1/2006--Public Law.
Sierra National Forest Land Exchange Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to convey specified federal land in Mt. Diablo Meridian, California, in exchange for certain non-federal land in Mt. Diablo Meridian and a payment of $50,000, if the owner of such land offers to make such exchange during the year following enactment of this Act. Requires that the recipient of the federal land convey all 160 acres of such land to the Sequoia Council of the Boy Scouts of America within 120 days after the date on which the recipient receives title to that land. Directs the Secretary to: (1) manage the non-federal land received in accordance with the Weeks Act and any other laws, including regulations, applicable to the National Forest System; and (2) deposit the cash payment received into the fund established by the Sisk Act, to be expended for the acquisition of lands and interests in lands for the National Forest System in California. Requires that the owner of the non-federal land pay to the Secretary all direct costs associated with processing the land exchange. Requires any such amounts received by the Secretary to be deposited in a cost collection account to be expended for the costs associated with the land exchange. Provides for the refund of any amounts remaining in such account after completion of the land exchange that are not needed to cover the expenses of such exchange. Considers the boundaries of the Sierra National Forest to be its boundaries as of January 1, 1965. States that, in accordance with a specified agreement entered into by the Forest Service, the Council, and the owner of the hydroelectric Project No. 67 and executed on April 17, 2006: (1) the Secretary shall grant an easement to the owner of Project No. 67; and (2) the Council shall grant a right of first refusal to that owner. Requires the Council to provide to the owner of the project, under such terms and conditions as are agreed to by the Council and such owner, a right of first refusal to obtain the federal land, or a portion of such land, that the Council proposes to sell, transfer, or otherwise convey. Instructs the Secretary, in exercising any discretion necessary to carry out this Act, to ensure that the public interest is well served. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to decrease the amount provided for carrying out the Biomass Commercial Use Grant Program and the Improved Biomass Use Grant Program for FY2007-FY2016.</summary>
