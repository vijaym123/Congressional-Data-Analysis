  <summary>7/12/2006--Introduced.
United States Physician Shortage Elimination Act of 2006 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the National Health Service Corps Medical School Scholarship Program to ensure an adequate supply of physicians providing primary health services. Requires the Secretary to provide scholarships and accept individuals into the Corps in exchange for such individuals completing a residency in a specialty needed by the Corps and serving as a provider of primary health services in a health professional shortage area for six years. Allows the Secretary to make grants to: (1) increase the capacity of medical schools to accept students each year; (2) recruit students to participate in the Corps Scholarship Program; (3) increase the number of minority health professionals servicing medically underserved communities; and (4) establish new or alternative-campus accredited medical residency programs affiliated with accredited medical programs. Allows the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to make grants to community health centers to: (1) increase the number of medical service providers associated with such centers; and (2) increase primary care capabilities through the construction, expansion, or renovation of facilities.</summary>
