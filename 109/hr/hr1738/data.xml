  <summary>4/20/2005--Introduced.
End Institutionalized Abuse Against Children Act of 2005 - Sets forth protections for the safety and welfare of children in foreign-based or domestic residential treatment facilities or institutions. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) seek the cooperation of appropriate foreign authorities periodically to investigate such institutions in a foreign country operated or managed by U.S. citizens or other private entities organized under U.S. laws (foreign-based institutions); and (2) make rules to protect children who are U.S. citizens or nationals and who are kept in foreign-based institutions for behavior modification. Sets forth civil penalties for U.S. citizens or such private entities who violate such rules. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require country reports on human rights practices to include descriptions of child abuse or human rights violations against any children at foreign-based institutions. Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States to support inspections of child residential treatment facilities. Conditions such grants on State adoption and enforcement of laws with licensing requirements for such institutions, including certain criminal and civil penalties, set forth in this Act.</summary>
