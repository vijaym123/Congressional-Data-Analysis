  <summary>7/27/2006--Introduced.
Comprehensive Comparative Study of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Populations Act of 2006 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health, to conduct or support a comprehensive study to: (1) compare total health outcomes, including risk of autism, in vaccinated, U.S. populations with such outcomes in unvaccinated, U.S. populations; and (2) determine whether vaccines or vaccine components play a role in the development of autism spectrum or other neurological conditions. Requires the Secretary to include in the study U.S. populations that have traditionally remained unvaccinated for religious or other reasons, members of clinical practices who choose alternative medical practices, and practitioners of anthroposophic lifestyles.</summary>
