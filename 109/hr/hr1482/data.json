    "text": "Hydrogen Liberty Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) establish an Advanced Reactor Hydrogen Cogeneration Project; (2) establish a national steering committee to advise the Secretary and the Director of the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science, and Technology on the project; (3) seek international cooperation, participation, and financial contribution in the project; and (4) establish cost-shared partnerships with domestic industry or international participants for the research, development, design, construction, and operation of the research facility. Grants the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing and regulatory authority for any reactor authorized under this Act. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) prepare a detailed roadmap to implement certain recommendations related to advanced nuclear reactor technologies, solar energy technologies, and wind energy technologies; and (2) provide for the establishment of five projects in diverse geographic areas to demonstrate the commercial production of hydrogen at existing nuclear power plants, including one demonstration project at a national laboratory or institution of higher education using an advanced gas-cooled reactor. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the NRC to give priority to the licensing of a utilization facility that is collocated with a hydrogen production facility. Directs the Secretary to support research programs at institutions of higher education for the development of advanced nuclear reactor energy technologies, solar energy technologies, and wind energy technologies for the production of hydrogen."
