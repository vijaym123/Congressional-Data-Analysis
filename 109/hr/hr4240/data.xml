  <summary>11/7/2005--Introduced.
Secure America Act of 2005 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct that the Secretary of Homeland Security place an alien (other than from Mexico or Canada) who has not been admitted or paroled into expedited removal if apprehended within 100 miles of the border and within 14 days of unauthorized entry. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to promulgate increased alien smuggling sentencing guidelines. Amends the INA to increases criminal penalties for alien smuggling. Amends federal criminal law to provide additional penalties for carrying or using a firearm during alien smuggling activities. Authorizes the use of the Armed Forces to secure the U.S. border. Amends the INA to: (1) provide mandatory minimum sentences for aliens convicted of reentry after removal; and (2) impose on smugglers the same sentences that the aliens they have smuggled would receive. Authorizes the Secretary to deny admission to any citizen, national, or resident of a country that has denied or delayed accepting an alien from such country who has been ordered removed from the United States. Establishes in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the Bureau of Immigration Enforcement.</summary>
