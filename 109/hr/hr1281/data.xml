  <summary>3/14/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to extend trade adjustment assistance (TAA) to workers in an entity engaged in the business of providing information technology or other high technology services (service sector firm or its subdivision). Revises group eligibility requirements for TAA to include: (1) a shift, by such workers' firm or subdivision to a foreign country, in provision of services, like or directly competitive with services which are provided by such firm or subdivision; and (2) the situation where such workers' firm or subdivision obtains or is likely to obtain such services from a foreign country. Extends TAA to adversely affected secondary workers in such a service sector firm or its subdivision.</summary>
