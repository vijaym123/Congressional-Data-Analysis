Revises group eligibility requirements for TAA to include: (1) a shift, by such workers' firm or subdivision to a foreign country, in provision of services, like or directly competitive with services which are provided by such firm or subdivision; and (2) the situation where such workers' firm or subdivision obtains or is likely to obtain such services from a foreign country. Extends TAA to adversely affected secondary workers in such a service sector firm or its subdivision."
