Provides for an exception if such invention was sold or disposed of, by or with the consent of the inventor or discoverer for purposes of exploitation of the invention: (1) to other persons in the United States more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent; (2) to other persons in a foreign country more than four years prior to such date; or (3) in the case of a tree or vine, to other persons in a foreign country more than six years prior to such date. Declares that the plant patent applies equally to any plant that is not clearly distinguishable from a protected plant."
