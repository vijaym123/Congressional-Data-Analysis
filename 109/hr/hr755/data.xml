  <summary>2/10/2005--Introduced.
Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), respectively, to assume specified responsibilities for nuclear safety and for occupational safety and health at nonmilitary energy laboratories owned or operated by the Department of Energy (DOE). Eliminates DOE's regulatory and enforcement authority with respect to such responsibilities assumed by NRC and OSHA. Makes such transfers of authority effective two years after enactment of this Act.</summary>
