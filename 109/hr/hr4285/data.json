Directs the Secretary to: (1) coordinate fully the Department of Homeland Security's canine training programs that support its counter-terrorism, counter-smuggling, transporation security, border security, and other missions; (2) ensure that the Department is maximizing its use of existing training facilities and resources to train canines throughout the year; and (3) consider ways to use detection canines trained by other federal agencies, non-profit organizations, universities, and private training facilities in order to increase the number of trained detection canines available to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make it a priority to increase the number of domestically bred canines used to assist in the Department's counter-terrorism mission; and (2) consult with other federal agencies that use canines and the Office of Management and Budget to encourage domestic breeding of canines, and consolidate canine procurement, where possible, across the federal government to reduce the cost of purchasing canines."
