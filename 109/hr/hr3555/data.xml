  <summary>7/28/2005--Introduced.
Responsible Funding to Prevent Teen Pregnancy Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award competitive grants to public and private entities to establish or expand teenage pregnancy prevention programs. Requires the Secretary to give: (1) highest priority to applicants seeking assistance for programs targeting communities or populations in which teenage pregnancy or birth rates are higher than the state average or are increasing; and (2) priority to applicants seeking assistance for programs that will benefit underserved or at-risk populations or will take advantage of other available resources and be coordinated with other programs that serve youth. Requires funds to be used for programs that: (1) replicate or substantially incorporate elements of teenage pregnancy prevention programs that have proven to delay sexual intercourse or sexual activity, increase condom or contraceptive use (without increasing sexual activity), or reduce teenage pregnancy; and (2) incorporate specified strategies for preventing teenage pregnancy, including outreach or media programs. Requires programs receiving funds that focus on instruction that includes discussion of human sexuality and reproduction to provide medically accurate information regarding the health benefits and side effects of all contraceptives and barrier methods as a means to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Requires the Secretary to: (1) conduct or provide for a rigorous evaluation of 10% of programs for which a grant is awarded; (2) collect basic data on each program; and (3) report to Congress on grant effectiveness.</summary>
