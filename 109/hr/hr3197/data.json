Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations that require: (1) handlers to register facilities, to sell or distribute ammonium nitrate only to registered handlers and purchasers, and maintain records of sale or distribution that include the name, address, telephone number, and registration number of the immediate subsequent purchaser of ammonium nitrate; and (2) registration of purchasers. Authorizes the Secretary to make warrantless inspections during business hours of any place that may handle ammonium nitrate to determine whether such handling accords with this Act. Makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) fail to perform any duty required by this Act and related regulations; (2) violate the terms of registration under this Act; (3) fail to keep any record, make any report, or allow any inspection required by this Act; or (4) violate any sale or distribution order issued under this Act. Establishes civil penalties for violations."
