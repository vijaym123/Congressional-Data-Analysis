    "text": "Enhance and Protect Local Community Radio Act of 2005 - Repeals provisions in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, that required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) modify rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations to prescribe minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels; (2) prohibit applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station from obtaining a low-power FM license; and (3) conduct a program to test whether low-power FM radio stations will result in harmful interference to existing FM radio stations if minimum distance separations for third-adjacent channels are not required. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the FCC to modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between: (1) low-power FM stations; and (2) full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations. Directs the FCC to: (1) ensure the availability of spectrum for low-power FM stations; (2) establish a schedule for low-power station licensing opportunities; (3) explore the public interest obligations of FM and AM digital terrestrial radio licenses; (4) ensure that low-power FM stations will not be displaced by the granting of licenses to full-power FM stations; and (5) prohibit the future voluntary transfers of construction permits for FM translator stations or FM booster stations."
