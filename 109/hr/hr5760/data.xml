Giant Sequoia National Monument Transition Act of 2006 - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to proceed with and complete each timber sale located within the boundaries of the Giant Sequoia National Monument: (1) that was under contract as of April 15, 2000, the date of the designation of the Monument; or (2) for which a decision notice was signed after January 1, 1999, but prior to December 31, 1999. Directs the Secretary to: (1) designate the Kings River Demonstration Project in the Sierra National Forest as the "Kings River Research Project" as a means to address disputes over fuels reduction projects and the benefits and impacts related to wildlife, watershed, and other resources; (2) provide, under the Project, for research about the potential positive and negative impacts of fuel reduction and forest health treatments on the Pacific fisher, California spotted owl, and the Kings River watershed; and (3) complete the final environmental impact statement and issue the record of decision for the Project by not later than October 31, 2006. Deems the final environmental impact statement and record of decision, along with all actions implementing the Project, to be in compliance with specified environmental laws, so long as any timber removed under the Project is removed using uneven-aged silvicultural treatments.</summary>
