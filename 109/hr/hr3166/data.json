Provides for: (1) voluntary donation of grazing permits; (2) county transitional payments; and (3) permanent retirement of grazing allotments which have no valid grazing permits or allotment leases. States that a permittee or lessee shall maintain a lease for the remainder of its term in instances of voluntary nonuse or less than minimum use."
