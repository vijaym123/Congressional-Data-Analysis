Amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to state that any agreement or action for by a U.S. person, including a Member of Congress, on behalf of a foreign person in order to influence or change any U.S. law or regulation that would ease restrictions on a state sponsor of terrorism, or provide a financial benefit to the foreign person or business concern shall be deemed to be prohibited U.S. export assistance. Expresses the sense of Congress that any Member of Congress who enters into any such agreement or takes any action on behalf of a foreign person should be sanctioned under the appropriate rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives."
