Defines \"bid shopping\" as the practice of divulging, or causing to be divulged, a contractor's or subcontractor's bid or proposal or requiring a contractor or subcontractor to divulge its bid or proposal to another prospective contractor or subcontractor before the award of a contract or subcontract in order to secure a lower bid or proposal. Requires any invitation for bid or request for proposal issued by the government to include a clause explicitly prohibiting such practice and specifying penalties, which may include contract termination or imposition of liquidated damages equal to the greater of: (1) the final bid on the contract; or (2) the price paid to the contractor or subcontractor for work performed."
