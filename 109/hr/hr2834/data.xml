  <summary>6/9/2005--Introduced.
Construction Quality Assurance Act of 2005 - Prohibits the federal government or any contractors or subcontractors from participating in the practice of bid shopping with respect to any government contract exceeding $1 million for the construction or repair of any public building or public work. Defines "bid shopping" as the practice of divulging, or causing to be divulged, a contractor's or subcontractor's bid or proposal or requiring a contractor or subcontractor to divulge its bid or proposal to another prospective contractor or subcontractor before the award of a contract or subcontract in order to secure a lower bid or proposal. Requires any invitation for bid or request for proposal issued by the government to include a clause explicitly prohibiting such practice and specifying penalties, which may include contract termination or imposition of liquidated damages equal to the greater of: (1) the final bid on the contract; or (2) the price paid to the contractor or subcontractor for work performed.</summary>
