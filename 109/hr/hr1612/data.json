    "text": "Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to require the head of each federal agency to ensure that it purchases: (1) ethanol-blended gasoline containing at least 10 percent ethanol rather than nonethanol-blended gasoline, for its vehicles that use gasoline in areas in which ethanol-blended gasoline is reasonably available at a generally competitive price; and (2) biodiesel-blended diesel fuel that contains, by certain starting dates over ten years, specified increasing percentages of biodiesel, rather than nonbiodiesel-blended diesel fuel, in locations where fleet vehicles are centrally fueled. Exempts specified vehicles from this requirement."
