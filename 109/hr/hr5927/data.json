Amends federal transportation law to provide: (1) phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles; and (2) a national tire efficiency program for passenger cars and light trucks. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish Energy Star Program requirements, and an Energy Star rating program for solar water heating devices. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to prescribe standards for household appliances in standby mode. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) increase the energy efficient commercial buildings deduction; (2) extend the timeframe for placing into service production facilities for renewable electric energy; and (3) establish a tax credit for telecommuting.

Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish an investment tax credit for the construction of new electricity transmission lines to carry electricity from renewable energy resources. Authorizes loan guarantees for biorefineries and renewable energy production facilities. Directs the President to take measures to ensure decreased electricity consumption for federal nondefense related activities. Requires design phases for future federal buildings to meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design green building rating standard. Prescribes guidelines governing the fuel economy of the federal fleet of vehicles. Requires executive agency motor purchases to include high-efficiency vehicles, or hybrid electric vehicles. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to authorize appropriations for basic research at the Department of Energy (DOE). Amends the Department of Energy Science Education Enhancement Act to prescribe organization guidelines for mathematics, science, and engineering education programs. Authorizes DOE research grants for early career scientists and engineers to pursue independent research. Establishes: (1) the Advanced Research Projects Authority-Energy; and (2) the Acceleration Fund for Research and Development of Energy Technologies. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) designate transit-oriented development corridors in urbanized areas; and (2) award transit grants for transit facilities, bicycle transportation, and pedestrian walkways in a transit-oriented development corridor. Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to increase and extend weatherization assistance. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to establish a grants program, low-interest loans, and loan guarantees for commercialization of new: (1) renewable energy technologies; (2) technologies for energy generation from fossil fuels that incorporate carbon sequestration; and (3) energy efficiency technologies."
