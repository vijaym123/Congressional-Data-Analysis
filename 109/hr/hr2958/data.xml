Pipeline Safety Emergency Notification Act or Marc and Chelsea's Law - Amends federal transportation law to revise certain one-call notification system minimum requirements to require a person (including a government employee or contractor) who, while engaged in demolition, excavation, tunneling, or construction in the vicinity of a pipeline, becomes aware of damage to the pipeline that may endanger life or cause serious bodily harm or damage to property, or damages the pipeline in such a manner, to promptly report the damage to the pipeline operator and to other appropriate authorities (notification of medical, law enforcement, and fire prevention public authorities, or calling 9-1-1). Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for violation of such requirements.</summary>
