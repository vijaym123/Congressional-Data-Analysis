    "text": "Asthma Awareness, Education and Treatment Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to public and nonprofit private entities for projects for specified asthma-related activities in low-income communities, including screening and referrals, information and education, and workshops for parents and other individuals who supervise children. Authorizes the Secretary to award contracts to provide for a national media campaign to inform the public and health care providers about asthma, allergies, and related respiratory problems, especially in children. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to give taxpayers licensed and engaged in the trade or business of providing pest control services or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning services an income tax credit for the aggregate cost of providing such services without charge to: (1) public housing; or (2) any multifamily residential rental property at least 75 percent of whose occupants are reasonably expected to have incomes below 200 percent of the official poverty line. Directs the Secretary to provide for research regarding a causal relationship between air pollutants and the occurrence of asthma, allergies, and related respiratory problems. Requires the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, through the National Asthma Education Prevention Program Coordinating Committee, to: (1) identify Federal programs that carry out asthma-related activities; and (2) develop and submit to Congress a Federal plan for responding to asthma. Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect and publish asthma-related data."
