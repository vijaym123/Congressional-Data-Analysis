  <summary>2/2/2005--Introduced.
Oral Health Promotion Act of 2005 - Amends title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance) (SCHIP) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to add dental services to coverage provided. Allows States the option of using Federal SCHIP funds to cover dental expenses for a child who is eligible for Medicaid under targeted low-income child Medicaid guidelines when the child has medical coverage that does not include dental services. Allows States the option of covering dental services of adults receiving assistance under SCHIP. Alters the Medicaid matching rate for adult full coverage dental benefits. Establishes in the Treasury the Community Oral Health Expansion Fund to expand the availability of oral health services through community-based centers. Authorizes the use of funds for demonstration projects and demonstration partnerships with Head Start programs for identifying children at risk of dental disease and providing prevention measures. Requires States to contribute, directly or indirectly, up to ten percent of demonstration project costs. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give grant: (1) priority to States covering a Medicaid level of dental benefits under SCHIP; and (2) preference to States with market-based payment rates for dental services under both Medicaid and SCHIP.</summary>
