Requires the Director to be appointed from among persons who have extensive background in emergency or disaster-related management, including at least two years of experience as a head of a state or local government disaster-management agency in a state with at least one million residents. Requires the Director also to have appropriate formal training in emergency or disaster-related management. Sets a six year term of office for an individual appointed as the Director. Repeals provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 that are related to: (1) the definition of major disaster; (2) functions transferred with respect to FEMA; and (3) the role of FEMA."
