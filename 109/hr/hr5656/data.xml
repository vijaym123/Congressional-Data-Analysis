  <summary>7/28/2006--Reported to House amended.
Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application Act of 2006 - (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of Energy to implement the following energy research, development and commercial application (RDCA) projects: (1) advanced clean coal energy (FutureGen) technology; (2) advanced nuclear fuel cycle technologies for generating electricity and industrial process heat from nuclear power; (3) advanced battery technologies for use in motor vehicles, particularly for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; (4) production of motor and other liquid fuels from biomass; (5) technologies to enable practical onboard storage of hydrogen for use as a fuel for light-duty motor vehicles; (6) advanced solar photovoltaic technologies; and (7) advanced wind energy technologies. (Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations for: (1) for advanced biofuel technologies for FY2007-FY2009; and (2) advanced solar photovoltaic and wind energy technologies for FY2007-FY2010. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to continue to implement RDCA and demonstration activities previously authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 for: (1) distributed energy; (2) micro-cogeneration technology; (3) geothermal energy; (4) hydropower; and (5) ocean energy. (Sec. 10) Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct an RDCA program for technologies needed in the development of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric drive transportation; and (2) establish a pilot plug-in hybrid electric vehicle demonstration program to provide up to 25 competitive grants annually to governmental and public entities, and metropolitan transportation authorities. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2011. (Sec. 11) Solar Utilization Now Demonstration Act of 2006, or the SUN Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary to establish a grants program for states to demonstrate advanced photovoltaic technology. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2011. (Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary to establish a grants program for businesses and organizations for new construction or renovation of energy efficient buildings (giving due consideration to proposals for buildings that are likely to serve low and moderate income populations). Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2012. (Sec. 13) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to revise requirements for the Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers grant program. Includes the cooperative extension services of land-grant colleges and universities among eligible grant recipients. Requires a geographically dispersed network of such Centers. Gives grant priority to applicants already operating or partnered with an outreach program capable of transferring knowledge and information about advanced energy efficiency methods and technologies. Requires the Secretary to ensure that, to the extent practicable, the program enables the transfer of knowledge and information about a variety of technologies and in a variety of geographic areas. Requires preference be given to applicants that would significantly expand on or fill a gap in existing programs in a geographical region. Specifies activities grant funds may be used for, as well as minimum application requirements. Makes the initial grant period five years, which may be extended an additional three years for grantees receiving a positive evaluation. Prohibits the use of grant funds for construction of facilities. (Sec. 14) Authorizes the Secretary to contribute (grant) funds to the National Science Foundation for: (1) the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (Green Education) program; and (2) improvement of interdisciplinary engineering and architecture education related to the design and construction of high performance buildings. Directs the Secretary give grant fund: (1) priority to applications from departments, programs, or centers of a school of engineering partnered with schools, departments, or programs of design, architecture, and city, regional, or urban planning; and (2) due consideration to applications from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other minority serving institutions. (Sec. 15) Directs the Secretary to arrange with the National Academy of Sciences to study and make further recommendations to Congress regarding its October 2005 recommendation to establish an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). (Sec. 16) Directs the Secretary to establish a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of coal gasification facilities that convert coal into pipeline quality gaseous fuels for direct use or subsequent chemical or physical conversion. (Sec. 17) Directs the Secretary to implement a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of additives to alternative biobased fuels and Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel fuels to make them more compatible with existing infrastructure used to store and deliver petroleum-based fuels to the point of final sale. Requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a physical properties data base and standard reference materials for alternative fuels, maintained and updated as additional alternative fuels become available. (Sec. 18) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to authorize allocation of appropriations for FY2007-FY2009 for renewable energy RDCA and demonstration programs. Directs the Secretary, in making awards for the program to demonstrate the commercial application of integrated biorefineries, to encourage the commercial application of technologies for biodegradable natural plastics made from biomass.</summary>
