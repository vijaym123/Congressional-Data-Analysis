Requires a prior authorization system to provide, in addition, that, if a response is not received to a request for authorization of such a drug within 24 hours after the prescription is transmitted, payment is made for a 30 day supply of the medication. Chapter 2: Reform of Asset Transfer Rules - (Sec. 3111) Lengthens the look-back period to 60 months for income and assets disposed of by the individual after enactment of this Act. Changes the start date of the ineligibility period for all transfers made on or after enactment of this Act, to the first day of a month during or after which assets have been transferred for less than fair market value (as under current law), or the date on which the individual is eligible for medical assistance under the state plan and is receiving certain nursing home or other related long-term care services, whichever is later, and which does not occur during any period of ineligibility as a result of an asset transfer policy. Specifies the criteria by which an application for an undue hardship waiver would be approved (by codifying current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance on state procedure).

Directs the Secretary to establish a process to waive application of this exclusion for demonstrated hardship cases. (Sec. 3115) Allows state-licensed, registered, certified, or equivalent continuing care retirement communities or life communities to require in their admissions contracts that residents spend their resources, declared for the purpose of admission, on their care before they apply for Medicaid. Considers certain entrance fees for continuing care retirement communities or life care communities to be countable resources available to the applicant for purposes of the Medicaid eligibility determination if certain conditions are met. Requires such fees, among other things, to be usable to pay for an individual's care if other resources or income are insufficient to do so. Chapter 3: Flexibility in Cost-Sharing and Benefits - (Sec. 3121) Allows a state, at its option and through a state plan amendment, to impose premiums and cost-sharing for any group of individuals and for any type of services consistent with specified limitations, including waiver of premium for individuals with family income below 100% of the poverty level, and a 5% of family income cost-sharing limit for families below or above 100% of the poverty level. Specifies other types of beneficiaries exempt from premiums and services exempt from cost-sharing. Allows states to: (1) condition the provision of medical assistance on the prepayment of premiums, and to terminate eligibility for such assistance for failure to pay a premium if that failure continues for at least 60 days; (2) waive premium payments in such cases where such payments would impose an undue hardship; and (3) permit Medicaid providers to require a Medicaid beneficiary to pay authorized cost-sharing as a condition for the provision of care or services. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the impact of Medicaid premiums and cost-sharing on access to, and utilization of, services.

(Sec. 3408) Prohibits any full-power TV station licensee that operates between 698 (currently, 746) and 806 megahertz from operating at that frequency after the end of the DTV service transition period. Allows a low-power TV station, TV translator station, or TV booster station to operate above 698 megahertz on a secondary basis in accordance with FCC rules, including those governing completion of the DTV service transition for low-power broadcasters. Directs the Assistant Secretary to use funds from the Low Power Digital-to-Analog Conversion Fund to implement and administer a program through which each eligible low-power TV station may receive compensation toward the purchase cost of a digital-to-analog conversion device that enables it to convert the incoming digital station of its corresponding full-power TV station to analog format transmission on the low-power TV station's analog channel. (Sec. 3409) Provides consumer education requirements for the FCC with respect to analog TV service. Requires manufacturers to place in a conspicuous place on analog TV receivers a notice that such receiver has only an analog broadcast tuner, that after December 31, 2008, TV broadcasters will broadcast only in digital format, and that, after such date, a converter box or cable or satellite service will be required to receive digital programming. Directs the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to engage in a public outreach program to educate consumers regarding the DTV transition, and to report semiannually to specified congressional committees on such program.

Revises the requirement that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provide pass-through deposit insurance for the deposits of any employee benefit plan. Repeals the exception from such coverage requirement for any insured depository institution which, at the time such deposits are accepted, may not accept brokered deposits. Excepts from such coverage requirement, instead, any insured depository institution that is neither well-capitalized nor adequately capitalized, which may not accept such deposits. Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to: (1) change the insured amount of deposits to a net insured amount, according to a specified formula; (2) the maximum amount of deposit insurance coverage for instate municipal deposits according to a specified formula, but not to exceed $2 million; (3) double the standard maximum deposit insurance for certain retirement accounts; and (4) require the National Credit Union Administrator to provide pass-through share insurance of up to $130,000, adjusted for cost-of-living, for the deposits or shares of any employee benefit plan. (Sec. 4004) Amends the FDIA to replace assessment guidelines for achieving and maintaining a designated reserve ratio (DRR) and for independent treatment of deposit insurance funds. Requires the FDIC Board of Directors (Board) to set assessments as it determines appropriate, including a maximum base rate for assessments at one basis point for insured depository institutions in the lowest-risk category. (Thus, eliminates the current minimum 23 basis point cliff rate.) Reduces from five years to three years the mandatory assessment recordkeeping period. Increases penalties from $100 to 1% of assessments per day for failure of a depository institution assessed more than $10,000 to make timely assessment payments. Revises guidelines governing the risk-based assessment system to make the portion of deposits attributable to lifeline accounts subject to half the assessment rate that would otherwise be applicable. (Sec. 4005) Replaces the current 1.25% DRR used to recapitalize undercapitalized insurance funds with a reserve ratio range of 1.15% to 1.4% of estimated insured deposits, subject to specified factors and annual redetermination. (Sec. 4006) Directs the Board to collect information from all appropriate sources in determining risk of DIF losses. (Sec. 4007) Revises requirements for FDIC repayment of overpaid assessments and refunds of any balance in the insurance fund in excess of the DRR. Prescribes guidelines governing: (1) the payment of mandatory dividends to insured depository institutions whenever the DIF reserve ratio exceeds specified percentages of the estimated insured deposits required to maintain the DRR in effect at the time; and (2) a one-time credit based upon the December 31, 1996, assessment base of each eligible depository institution, as compared to the combined aggregate assessment base of all such institutions. Restricts the amount of such credit for depository institutions that exhibit financial, operational, or compliance weakness, including undercapitalization. Requires the Board to establish an ongoing system of credits (ongoing credit pool) to be applied against future assessments on the same basis as such dividends. (Sec. 4008) Requires the Board to establish and implement a DIF restoration plan whenever its reserve ratio is projected to fall, or actually falls, below the DRR.
