  <summary>6/14/2005--Introduced.
Working Families Gas Tax Credit Act of 2005 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a nonrefundable tax credit for gasoline, diesel fuel, or kerosene used in highway vehicles for nonbusiness purposes. Limits the amount of such credit to $250 annually ($500 for joint returns). Reduces the allowable credit amount for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross incomes over $25,000 ($50,000 for joint returns). Allows the credit only in taxable years when the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the percentage change in the price of a gallon of gasoline is at least 200 percent of the change in the inflation rate for such year.</summary>
