    "text": "North Bay Water Reuse Program Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the planning, design, and construction of water reclamation and reuse projects with eligible entities in the North San Pablo Bay watershed located in Napa, Sonoma, Marin, and Solano Counties, California. Requires: (1) the Secretary, in carrying out such reclamation and reuse projects, to build upon the design work and environmental evaluation undertaken by non-Federal entities and by the Corps of Engineers to the greatest degree practicable; and (2) all planning, design, and construction of recycled water projects to be undertaken in accordance with cooperative agreements between the Secretary and eligible entities. Limits the Federal share of projects funded under this Act to 65 percent of the total cost of project planning, environmental evaluation, and construction. Requires the Secretary to make grants and other funds available to eligible entities for the initial development of environmental improvement and enhancement components of the North Bay Water Reuse Program. States that nothing in this Act: (1) invalidates or preempts State water law or interstate compacts governing water; (2) alters the rights of States to appropriated shares of surface or groundwater; (3) preempts or modifies State or Federal laws or interstate compacts governing water quality or disposal; or (4) confers on nonfederal entities the ability to exercise Federal water rights."
