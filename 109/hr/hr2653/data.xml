  <summary>5/26/2005--Introduced.
Landlord Accountability Act of 2005 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to the section 8 rental housing voucher program to consider a unit to be in noncompliance with housing quality standards if: (1) the public housing agency (PHA) or authorized inspector determines the unit to be in noncompliance and notifies the owner in writing; and (2) the owner fails to make necessary repairs within 90 days of notice. Directs a PHA to withhold owner assistance until the repairs are completed. Authorizes a PHA to make such repairs and subtract the costs from the amount subsequently released to the owner. Prohibits an owner from terminating a tenant lease because of any such withholding. States that if amounts are withheld, the owner fails to correct the noncompliance, and the lease is not renewed, the PHA shall pay such amount to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</summary>
