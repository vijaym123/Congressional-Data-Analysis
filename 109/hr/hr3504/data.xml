  <summary>7/28/2005--Introduced.
Life Insurance Anti-Discrimination in Travel Act - Declares that it is unlawful to deny any person life insurance coverage, or to discriminate in the issuance, cancellation, terms (including premium rates), or conditions of life insurance coverage, based upon the past lawful travel experiences of such person. Exempts property and casualty insurance, certain health insurance, and workers compensation insurance from such proscription. States that a violation of this Act constitutes an unfair method of competition and an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.</summary>
