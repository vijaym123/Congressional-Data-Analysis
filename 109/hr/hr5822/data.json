Requires such scholarships to enable students to attend: (1) the private elementary or secondary school of their parent's choice; or (2) a public elementary or secondary school of their parent's choice outside the student's home school district, consistent with state law. Requires the Secretary to conduct an independent evaluation of this program, including an assessment of its impact on student achievement."
