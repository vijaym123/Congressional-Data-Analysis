    "text": "Recreational Boaters Streamlined Inspection Act - Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish an inspection program that uses a videophone system at specified points of entry in Florida through which: (1) a master of a recreational vessel may report to an appropriate official of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for purposes of the Tariff Act of 1930; and (2) a master and the passengers of such a vessel may report to an appropriate DHS official to satisfy requirements for lawful entry into the United States under immigration laws. Requires the program to be used only in a case in which the master of, and each passenger on, a recreational vessel is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. Provides that the program shall not affect the Secretary's authority to require such individual to wait for a customs inspection or to report the arrival of the vessel to the nearest customs facility or such other place as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations."
