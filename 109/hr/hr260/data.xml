  <summary>1/6/2005--Introduced.
Father's Equity Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act respecting acquisition of citizenship for a child born abroad and out of wedlock to a U.S.-citizen father to: (1) eliminate the requirement that the father agree in writing to provide financial support until the child reaches 18 years old; and (2) require that the child, at any time (currently, while under age 18), must have been legitimated or had paternity acknowledged or adjudicated. States that nothing in the provision respecting acquisition of citizenship for a child born abroad and out of wedlock shall be construed to preclude establishment of citizenship after the parent or parents' death.</summary>
