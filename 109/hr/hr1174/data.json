    "text": "Sand Conservation and Taxpayer Savings Act of 2005 - Amends the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1992 to replace provisions regarding beneficial uses of dredged material with provisions regarding regional sediment management. Directs the Secretary of the Army, in connection with sediment obtained in connection with an authorized Federal water resources project and acting through the Chief of Engineers, to develop regional sediment management plans and carry out projects for: (1) the protection of property; (2) the protection, restoration, and creation of aquatic and ecologically related habitats; and (3) the transport and placement of suitable sediment at specified locations. Authorizes projects to be undertaken where the Secretary finds that: (1) the environmental, economic, and social benefits of the project justify the cost; and (2) the project would not result in environmental degradation. Makes operation, maintenance, replacement, and rehabilitation costs associated with a project a non-Federal sponsor responsibility. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Chief, to develop at Federal expense plans and projects for regional management of sediment obtained in conjunction with projects, subject to specified limitations. Authorizes the Secretary, through the Chief, to cooperate with any State in preparing a comprehensive State or regional coastal sediment management plan within the State's boundaries and to encourage State participation in implementing it. Repeals provisions of the WRDA of 1976 regarding the placement on State beaches of sand dredged in constructing and maintaining navigation inlets and channels adjacent to such beaches."
