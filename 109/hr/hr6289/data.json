    "text": "Personalized Health Information Act of 2006 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program to provide financial incentives for the establishment of interactive qualifying personal health records for Medicare and other patients and their health care providers in order to: (1) provide patients access to and control over their personal health data and information and educational information; and (2) make available to authorized health care providers a more accurate minimum data set of patient information. Directs that under the program each qualified physician receives an incentive payment for each qualifying patient. Directs the Secretary to: (1) publish a list of qualifying physicians who participate in Medicare and have received such payments; and (2) take steps to educate Medicare beneficiaries and providers and other patients about the benefits of qualifying personal health records. Sets forth requirements for a qualified personal health record, including that such record: (1) is controlled solely by the patient; (2) meets minimum security standards; (3) complies with interoperability data standards; (4) is capable of sending patient-specific patient education, reminders, and clinical messages to the patient; and (5) is capable of providing de-identified data for public health analysis and research purposes. Requires the Secretary to: (1) set minimum security, privacy, and data use standards for such health records; (2) establish a consumer protection board to recommend standards and procedures to the Secretary; and (3) establish a PHR Incentive Fund to make incentive payments. Provides that such Fund shall accept contributions from: (1) the Secretary for Medicare beneficiaries; (2) drug manufacturers for messages regarding medical adherence programs; and (3) other Fund partners."
