Continues to exempt from FMLA coverage employees at worksites that employ fewer than 25 employees (currently 50), if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is fewer than 25 (currently 50). Allows all employees covered by FMLA to take up to 4 hours during any 30-day period, and up to 24 hours during any 12-month period, of parental involvement leave to participate in or attend their children's or grandchildren's educational and extracurricular activities. Amends Federal civil service law to apply such parental involvement leave allowance to Federal employees. Includes under FMLA entitlement leave for transporting children and grandchildren to medical and dental appointments and for visiting elderly relatives in nursing or group homes."
