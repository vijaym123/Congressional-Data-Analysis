  <summary>9/12/2006--Passed House amended.
Pascua Yaqui Mineral Rights Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the U.S. Attorney General and with the consent of the state of Arizona, to acquire through eminent domain all subsurface rights, title, and interests (including subsurface mineral interests) held by the state in certain parcels of land in Pima County, Arizona, owned by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, as well as such interests held by the state in certain land held in trust for the Tribe. Conditions such acquisition on the Tribe's agreement to reimburse the Secretary fully for all related costs. Requires the Secretary also to take into trust for the Tribe's benefit the subsurface rights, title, and interests, formerly reserved to the United States, to certain other parcels. Requires the Tribe to pay only the transaction costs relating to the assessment, review, and transfer of such subsurface rights, title, and interests.</summary>
