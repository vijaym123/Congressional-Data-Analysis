  <summary>5/9/2006--Introduced.
Library of Congress Employee Transition Assistance Act of 2006 - States that any employee of the Library of Congress who at any time before or after this Act's enactment has satisfactorily completed a probationary period with the Library under a nontemporary appointment acquires a competitive status for appointment to any position in the competitive service for which such employee possesses the required qualifications. Prohibits an employee who acquires a competitive status under this Act from being required to complete a probationary period upon appointment to a position in the competitive service. Treats a displaced Library of Congress employee as an employee of an executive department, government corporation, or independent establishment who is eligible for a special selection priority under the career transition assistance program for surplus and displaced federal employees administered by the Director of the Office Personnel Management (OPM). Defines such employees as certain employees, or former employees, of the Library of Congress who were separated from employment not more than 90 days prior to the date of the enactment of this Act.</summary>
