  <summary>2/17/2005--Introduced.
Rural Housing Tax Credit Act of 2005 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a nonrefundable tax credit (the lesser of ten percent of the purchase price or $5,000) for the purchase of a principal residence in a rural area by a first-time homebuyer. Limits the amount of such credit based on taxpayer modified adjusted gross income. Requires the recapture of credit amounts if a taxpayer fails to use a residence for which a tax credit is allowed as a principal residence or sells such residence within five years of purchase.</summary>
