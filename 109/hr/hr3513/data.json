    "text": "Solutions to Limit the Abuse of Methamphetamine (SLAM) Act - Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to lower the threshold for amounts of methamphetamine the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, importation, or exportation of which is subject to specified penalties. Increases: (1) the prison sentence of persons convicted under CSA or the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act for offenses involving methamphetamine or listed chemicals while in a facilitated entry program; and (2) penalties for various offenses involving listed chemicals and the manufacturing of controlled substances, including maintaining drug-involved premises. Prohibits sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, and coercive prostitution while illegally manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, possessing, or transporting a controlled substance. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require a state, to be eligible for justice system improvement grant funds for residential substance abuse treatment for state prisoners, to implement both periodic and random substance abuse testing and to require, as a condition of participation, that such testing indicate that the individual has not used a controlled substance for at least three months prior to testing. Amends the federal criminal code to direct that substance abuse treatment include urinalysis or other proven reliable forms of testing, including both periodic and random testing before entering, and while the prisoner participates in, the program. Directs the Attorney General: (1) acting through the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, to provide information to retailers regarding the purchase of precursor products by individuals who may intend to use them in illicit methamphetamine production; and (2) to designate such program as the MethWatch program."
