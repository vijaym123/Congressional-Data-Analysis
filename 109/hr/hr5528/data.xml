  <summary>6/6/2006--Introduced.
The Pornography Jurisdiction Limitation Act of 2006 - Amends the federal judicial code to provide that no court created by Act of Congress shall have jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court shall have no appellate jurisdiction, to hear or decide a question of whether a state pornography law imposes a constitutionally invalid restriction on the freedom of expression. Provides that a decision of a federal court, to the extent the decision relates to such a question, is not binding precedent on a state court.</summary>
