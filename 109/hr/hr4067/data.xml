  <summary>10/17/2005--Introduced.
TANF Recipients' Lifeline Act - Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) repeal the five year limit on TANF benefits; (2) require a state to which a TANF grant is made to use appropriate bilingual personnel and printed material in the administration of the state program in those portions of the state in which a substantial number of TANF recipients speak a language other than English; and (3) provide for inflation adjustment of the TANF block grant. Amends the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to exempt TANF benefits from the ban on federal means-tested public benefits for qualified aliens for the first five years after lawful entry into the United States.</summary>
