  <summary>12/6/2005--Reported to House amended.
Hurricane Check Cashing Relief Act of 2005 - Directs the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to establish an emergency program under which an insured depository institution may obtain an indemnification commitment from the FDIC for loss it has suffered (up to $2,000 per item) through cashing a check or share draft between August 25 and November 15, 2005, that: (1) is presented for payment by any individual who, as of August 25, 2005, resided in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, or Texas in a presidentially declared major disaster area; and (2) is subsequently uncollectible. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to direct the federal reserve banks to transfer from their surplus funds up to $200 million to meet the indemnification requirements of this Act. Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Board) to issue implementation guidelines. Provides for a limited 60-day extension of the check or share draft cashing period if the Board determines that the continuing impact of the 2005 hurricane disasters on financial intermediation between consumers and financial institutions, on payment networks, and on other forms of communication require an extension of the programs established under this Act in order to continue to meet the immediate needs of victims of the disaster.</summary>
