Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, to transfer to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement all functions (including personnel, assets, and liabilities attributable to such functions) of the Customs Patrol Officers unit operating on the Tohono O'odham Indian reservation ("Shadow Wolves" unit). Authorizes the Secretary to establish within United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement additional Customs Patrol Officer units. States that the transferred Customs Patrol Officer unit, and any additional units established under this Act, shall operate on Indian lands to prevent the entry into the United States of terrorists, unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband. Provides that: (1) a Customs Patrol Officer under this Act shall receive equivalent pay as a special agent with similar competencies within United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement pursuant to the Department of Homeland Security's Human Resources Management System; and (2) each unit under this Act shall be supervised by a Chief Customs Patrol Officer who shall have the same rank as a resident agent-in-charge of the Office of Investigations within United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</summary>
