  <summary>10/6/2005--Introduced.
Iran Nonproliferation Amendments Act of 2005 - Amends the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 to state that the definition of "extraordinary payments in connection with the International Space Station" does not mean U.S. cash or in-kind payments under the Agreement Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station, with annex, signed at Washington January 29, 1998, and entered into force March 27, 2001, or any protocol, agreement, memorandum of understanding, or contract related thereto (Agreement). (Under such Act the United States is prohibited from making such payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency unless specified determinations are made with respect to Russian cooperation in preventing proliferation to Iran, or to a foreign person identified as contributing to proliferation to Iran.) Directs the President to submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives a report that identifies each Russian entity or person to whom the United States has, since the date of enactment of this Act, made a cash or in-kind payment under the Agreement. Requires such report to: (1) include the purpose of each payment; and (2) the assessment that the payment was not prejudicial to preventing the proliferation of ballistic or cruise missile systems in Iran and other countries that have supported acts of international terrorism.</summary>
