  <summary>1/6/2005--Introduced.
Know Your Vote Counts Act of 2005 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to revise voting system standards to require the voting system used in an election for Federal office to provide the voter with an auditable paper record showing how the vote will be recorded by the system after the voter enters it. Requires the voter to use such record to verify that the vote shown is the vote the voter intends to cast. Requires the system, if the voter does not verify his or her vote, to provide the voter with: (1) the opportunity to change the ballot and correct any error, and (2) a new auditable paper record that reflects the change or correction made by the voter. Makes a vote final once a voter verifies that the vote shown on a paper record is the vote the voter intends to cast. Makes the paper record serve as a permanent paper record of the vote. Prohibits the removal of such record from the polling place except for purposes related to a recount. Requires voluntary voting system guidelines to include guidelines to ensure security of electronic data.</summary>
