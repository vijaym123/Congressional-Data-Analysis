  <summary>3/1/2006--Introduced.
Electronic Health Information Technology Act of 2006 - Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Social Security Act to establish within the Department of Health and Human Services an Office of Health Information Technology, headed by the Chief Health Informatics Officer (CHIO) of Health Information Technology (HIT), who shall develop, maintain, and direct the implementation of an interoperable HIT strategic plan to guide the nationwide implementation of interoperable health information technology in the public and private health care sectors. Transfers to the CHIO functions, personnel, assets, and liabilities of the National Coordinator for HIT. Requires the CHIO to award one-year grants to eligible HIT entities. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out a demonstration program to determine methods by which contextual access criteria and analysis technologies for specific diseases and health criteria may be used to search patient electronic health records and aggregated health information without using personal identifying information of patients. Amends SSA title XI part A to establish a health care provider HIT loan program. Makes exceptions to certain health anti-kickback laws to encourage the dissemination of health information technology. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on state laws and regulations relating to the security and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information to determine how any variation among the states, and between state and federal law, may adversely impact the electronic exchange of clinical health information among states, the federal government, and private entities.</summary>
