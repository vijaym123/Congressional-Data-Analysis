Child Care Public-Private Partnership Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a business-incentive grant program to provide child care through public-private partnerships.

Requires such services to: (1) be provided equitably and affordably to low- and moderate-income employees; and (2) comply with state and local licensing requirements. Gives priority in grant selection to businesses with fewer than 100 full-time employees.</summary>
