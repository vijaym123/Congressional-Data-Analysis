  <summary>1/10/2006--Public Law.
Makes technical corrections to the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 with respect to: (1) regulation of underground storage tanks; and (2) government-owned tanks. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the underground storage tank regulation program through FY2011. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to permit funds awarded under the Clean Coal Power Initiative for Fischer-Tropsch to be used to finance the cost of loan guarantees for projects that have been awarded such funds. Authorizes the Department of Energy to use for loan guarantee purposes certain funds awarded under the Clean Coal Power Initiative to implement a certain project located in a taconite-producing region that is entitled to enter into a long-term contract approved by a state public utility commission to sell at least 450 megawatts of output to a utility.</summary>
