Prohibits the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) from: (1) entering into a bilateral or multilateral trade agreement that, with respect to the importation of pharmaceutical products without the consent of the patent owners, includes provisions identical or similar to the provisions of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement, or the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement; or (2) negotiating an agreement or understanding with respect to any of such provisions. Requires the USTR, with respect to the advisory committee on matters relating to intellectual property, to ensure that, for each meeting that relates or potentially relates to the importation of pharmaceutical products into the United States, at least 10% of the committee members represent the interests of consumers of such products."
