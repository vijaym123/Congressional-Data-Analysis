Defines \"somatic cell\" to mean a cell of an embryo, fetus, child, or adult which is not and will not become a sperm or egg cell. Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to enter into an agreement with the National Research Council for a review of the implementation of this Act. States that nothing in this Act shall restrict other areas of scientific research not specifically prohibited by this Act, including work that involves: (1) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or other cloning technologies to clone molecules, DNA, cells other than human embryo cells, or tissues; or (2) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques to create animals other than humans. Expresses the sense of Congress that other countries should establish substantially equivalent prohibitions."
