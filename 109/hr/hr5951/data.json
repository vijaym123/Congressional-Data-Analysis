Healthy Workforce Act of 2006 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to: (1) allow a wellness program credit for employers; (2) remove the reduction in the highest tax rate applicable for taxable years after 2000; and (3) exclude from an employee's income the fees paid by an employer to an athletic or fitness facility on the employee's behalf. Provides for grants to promote individual and community health and to prevent the incidence of chronic disease. Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) regulate tobacco products (through the Food and Drug Administration); and (2) establish the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee. Sets forth tobacco product standards and registration, recordkeeping, reporting, manufacturer and importer user fee, labeling, advertising, and marketing requirements. Requires vending machines and certain restaurants to provide nutritional information about each food offered, including the number of calories. Amends the Social Security Act to provide coverage for certain counseling and screening services. Requires the Secretary to encourage a state program to utilize school-based health centers to deliver primary care to children eligible for federal medical assistance. Establishes the HeLP (Healthy Lifestyles and Prevention) America Trust Fund to fund smoking cessation efforts and other efforts required by this Act. Requires the Secretary to conduct research on obesity prevention, treatment, and control."
