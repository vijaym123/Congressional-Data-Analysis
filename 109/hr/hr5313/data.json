Provides with respect to cost sharing that: (1) the federal share of the purchase price of a conservation easement or other interest in eligible land shall not exceed 25%; and (2) the state agency, county, and other eligible entities involved in the purchase shall each contribute 25% of the purchase price. Prohibits fund use for administrative purposes. Makes the provisions of this Act effective on October 1, 2006."
