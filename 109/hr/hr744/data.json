Prohibits any person from bringing a civil action under state law premised upon the defendant's violating this Act. Provides that this Act does not prohibit any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of a law enforcement agency or a U.S. intelligence agency. (Sec. 3) Authorizes appropriations to the Attorney General for prosecutions needed to discourage the use of spyware and the practices commonly called phishing and pharming. (Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Justice should vigorously prosecute those who use spyware to commit crimes and those that conduct phishing or pharming scams."
