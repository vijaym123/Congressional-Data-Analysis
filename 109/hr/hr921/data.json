Defines as eligible institutions: (1) historically Black colleges or universities, (2) a Hispanic-, Alaskan Native-, or Native Hawaiian-serving institution; (3) a tribally controlled college or university; or (4) an institution with a sufficient enrollment of needy students as defined under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Outlines authorized assistance activities. Directs the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology to: (1) establish an advisory council to advise on the best approaches toward maximum Program participation by eligible institutions; and (2) ensure that grant awards are made to all types of eligible institutions. Provides a matching funds requirement. Limits grant awards to $2.5 million per institution. Requires: (1) each grant recipient to report annually to the Under Secretary on grant uses; (2) the National Academy of Public Administration to conduct periodic assessments (every three years) of the grant program; and (3) the Under Secretary to transmit such assessments to Congress, along with plans to implement any recommendations of the Academy. Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2010."
