Amends the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 to: (1) authorize grants for training programs to establish integrated domestic violence courts; (2) include among the eligibility criteria of the National Stalker and Domestic Violence Reduction grant program state certification that its laws relating to the elements of a stalking offense require only that the defendant has on more than one occasion harassed or threatened the victim (thereby excluding any requirement for a specific intent to cause fear); and (3) authorize grants for state hire of additional personnel for entering information relating to stalking and domestic violence data."
