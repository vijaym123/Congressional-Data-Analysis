  <summary>9/29/2005--Introduced.
Professional Sports Responsibility Act of 2005 - Requires the Attorney General to issue rules requiring major professional leagues (i.e., Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, and the National Hockey League) to test athletes for the illegal use of steroids and other performance-enhancing substances and Schedule I substances. Requires such regulations to establish: (1) the number of times each athlete should be tested and the prohibited substances; (2) a means for exempting substances used for a documented medical condition; (3) sufficient penalties for any athlete who tests positive and procedures for publicly disclosing such athlete's identity; and (4) an appeals process. Requires the Attorney General to authorize a private nonprofit organization to be an accreditation body to annually certify that each league's testing meets established standards. Allows the Attorney General to assess fines for failure to adopt or enforce the required testing policies. Requires the Attorney General to report to Congress regarding any league that fails to comply with such policies and the effectiveness of the regulations under this Act. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to double the maximum penalties for violations regarding anabolic steroids that occur near or at a sports facility or that involve an athlete. Directs the Comptroller General to study the illegal use of performance-enhancing substances and other controlled substances by college athletes. Allows the Attorney General to include as a major professional league any additional professional sports league or National Collegiate Athletic Association entities if such additions would prevent the illegal use of performance-enhancing substances and other controlled substances by athletes.</summary>
