  <summary>5/3/2006--Introduced.
UNRWA Integrity Act - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide that voluntary U.S. contributions to the regular budget of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) may be provided only during a period for which the President certifies to Congress that UNRWA: (1) is not an impediment to achieving a lasting solution for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza and moving such refugees to post-refugee status; (2) is subject to comprehensive, independent financial audits; (3) does not knowingly provide employment, refuge, freedom of movement, cash assistance, food assistance, housing rehabilitation assistance, or any other type of social services assistance to members of foreign terrorist organizations; and (4) does not promote anti-Semitism or the denial of Israel's right to exist. Authorizes a maximum 180-day waiver of such limitation for U.S. national security interests. Requires recertification not later than 180 days after the initial certification and every 180 days thereafter. Requires a report by the Secretary of State to Congress respecting the extent to which UNRWA: (1) serves Palestinian refugee and U.S. interests; and (2) includes in its educational materials anti-Semitic or anti-Israel elements.</summary>
