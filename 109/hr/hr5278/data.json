Authorizes a maximum 180-day waiver of such limitation for U.S. national security interests. Requires recertification not later than 180 days after the initial certification and every 180 days thereafter. Requires a report by the Secretary of State to Congress respecting the extent to which UNRWA: (1) serves Palestinian refugee and U.S. interests; and (2) includes in its educational materials anti-Semitic or anti-Israel elements."
