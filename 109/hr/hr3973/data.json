Requires that, once an area is designated as a pilot project site, the community that applied for such designation shall develop and submit to the Secretary concerned a plan to address post-disturbance rehabilitation of the project site, whether the uncharacteristic disturbance of the federal land is caused by a wildfire or a nonfire-related event. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to provide technical and financial assistance to communities to assist their efforts to develop a rehabilitation plan or to amend a community wildfire protection plan to include a rehabilitation plan. Provides for expedited rehabilitation activities following uncharacteristic disturbances at project sites. Directs the Secretary concerned to establish a national oversight committee to provide independent scientific and socioeconomic monitoring of the pilot projects and activities carried out at project sites."
