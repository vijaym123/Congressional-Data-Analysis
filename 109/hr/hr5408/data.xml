Joshua Haglund Justice and Peace Act of 2006 - Urges the Secretary of State to express to Armenian officials the serious concern of Congress with the lack of progress in resolving the murder of Joshua Haglund, a Minnesota resident who was teaching English in Armenia. Calls on Armenia to continue pursuing, in cooperation with U.S. officials, the investigation into his death, and to use all appropriate means to achieve justice in the case. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Education to fund the Joshua Haglund Memorial Peace Scholarship Fund at the University of Minnesota, which will finance study abroad scholarships and diversity training to further Joshua Haglund's vision of compassion, peace, and community service.</summary>
