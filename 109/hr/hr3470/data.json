Requires such regulations to: (1) permit longitudinal analysis of child-specific outcomes, including analysis of entry and exit cohort data for children in and emancipated from foster care; (2) permit AFCARS to be integrated with the planned National Youth in Transition Database; and (3) contain any other rules necessary to ensure that the revised AFCARS can perform specified functions."
