Defines \"reconstructive surgery\" as any medically necessary and appropriate surgery performed to correct or repair abnormal structures of the body caused by congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease to: (1) improve functions; or (2) give the patient a normal appearance. Excludes cosmetic surgery that is performed to alter or reshape normal structures of the body in order to improve appearance. Applies such requirements to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market."
