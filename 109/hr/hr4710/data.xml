  <summary>2/8/2006--Introduced.
Judiciary Rent Reform Act of 2006 - Amends the federal judicial code to direct the Administrator of General Services to establish rent charges for accommodations provided by the General Services Administration (GSA) in federally-owned space that do not exceed the GSA's actual costs of operating and maintaining them. Prohibits GSA from assessing any amount for shell rent, tenant improvements, parking rent, or real estate taxes for federally-owned space assigned to the judiciary. Makes the judiciary responsible for providing funds to the GSA from judiciary appropriations to pay for new repair and alteration, tenant improvement, and construction projects performed by the GSA for such accommodations, except for those projects for which the GSA has separately received appropriations.</summary>
