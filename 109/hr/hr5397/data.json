Requires the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children to: (1) recommend a uniform screening panel for newborn screening programs that includes the heritable disorders for which all newborns should be screened; and (2) develop a model decision-matrix for newborn screening program expansion. Directs the Secretary to adopt or reject any new or pending recommendations by the Advisory Committee. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to: (1) provide for quality assurance for screening laboratories; (2) provide for population-based pilot testing for evaluating use of new screening tools on a mass scale; (3) collect, analyze, and make available data on certain heritable disorders; and (4) operate regional centers for the conduct of applied epidemiological research on the prevention of such disorders."
