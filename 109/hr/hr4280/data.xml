Transportation Revenue Ultimatum Enforcement ID Act of 2005 - Prohibits a state from accepting as proof of personal identification or legal residence an individual's taxpayer identification number for purposes of issuing such individual a state-issued driver's license or personal identification card. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) withhold 100% of a state's apportionment for the National Highway System (NHS), the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, and the surface transportation program (STP) if the state fails to comply with such prohibition; and (2) transfer the equivalent amounts to the state's apportionment for incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program under the Immigration and National Act.</summary>
