Authorizes the relevant Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with gateway communities to coordinate the management of: (1) land use inventory, planning, and management activities administered by such Secretary; and (2) land use planning and management activities of other federal agencies, agencies of the state in which the federal lands are located, and local and tribal governments in the vicinity of such lands. Requires, when the plans and activities of two or more federal agencies are anticipated to have a significant impact on a gateway community, the consolidation and coordination of the agencies' plans and planning processes in order to facilitate the participation of affected gateway communities. Directs the relevant Secretary to allow affected gateway communities the opportunity to be recognized as cooperating agencies under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 when a proposed action is determined to require an environmental impact statement. Terminates the authority of the Secretary to carry out any provisions of this Act ten years after the enactment of this Act."
