  <summary>6/9/2005--Introduced.
Requires the Secretary of Defense, within ten days after the enactment of this Act, to certify to Congress that the Secretary has: (1) made all information used in making the 2005 round of base closure and realignment decisions, as required under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, available to Congress, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, and the Comptroller General of the United States; and (2) released, in unclassified form, all documents and other information used to prepare the recommendations submitted to Congress on May 13, 2005. States that, if the Secretary fails to take such action within the allotted time, the recommended 2005 base closures and realignments shall be suspended and have no further force and effect. Allows the resumption of the 2005 process upon such certification, with appropriate delays in the subsequent steps.</summary>
