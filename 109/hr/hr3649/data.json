Preserves until the end of FY2005, as though unamended, certain provisions of law otherwise amended by SRBA. (Sec. 102) Increases the authorization of appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to the Secretary of Transportation for payment of expenses of the Coast Guard for personnel and activities directly related to coordinating and carrying out the national recreational boating safety program. Decreases the amount of authorized appropriations available to the Secretary for activities to ensure compliance with safety standards for recreational vessels. (Sec. 103) Revises requirements for the apportionment of the remaining balance in the Boat Safety Account for FY2006-FY2010. Title II: Extension of Recreational Boating Funding Through the End of Fiscal Year 2005 - (Sec. 201) Amends the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act to extend through FY2005 the authorization of appropriations from the HTF for: (1) the national outreach and communications program; and (2) qualified projects under the Clean Vessel Act of 1992. (Sec. 203) Conforms the authorization of appropriations to the Coast Guard for the national recreational boating safety program with the increase under title I of this Act. Title III: Extension of Authorization For Use of Funds In Boat Safety Account - (Sec. 301) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend through FY2005 the authorization of expenditures from the Boat Safety Account to carry out state recreational boating safety programs. (Sec. 302) Declares that the obligation authority for funds made available under the Transportation, Treasury, Independent Agencies, and General Government Appropriations Act, 2005 (the Act) for expenses necessary to discharge the functions of the Secretary of Transportation with respect to traffic and highway safety shall be available in an amount equal to the funds provided. Requires the additional obligation authority needed to meet such requirement to be withdrawn from the obligation authority previously distributed to other surface transportation programs, projects, and activities funded from an amount (of up to 4.1%) deducted from various transportation programs under the Act."
