  <summary>4/26/2006--Introduced.
Independence from Oil with Agriculture Act of 2006 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to delete provisions that terminate tax credits after a certain time (thus extending such credits) for: (1) alcohol fuels; (2) biodiesel fuels; (3) alcohol fuel mixtures; (4) biodiesel mixtures; (5) electricity produced from wind and open-loop or close-loop biomass facilities; and (6) alternative fuel vehicle refueling property. Amends the Clean Air Act to: (1) increase the applicable volume of renewable fuel for calendar years 2008-2012 that must be part of gasoline in the United States (except in noncontiguous states or territories); and (2) increase the number of gallons of renewable fuel in the calculation used to determine the required volume of renewable fuel in gasoline for calendar years 2013 and thereafter.</summary>
