  <summary>5/10/2005--Introduced.
Chemical Security Act of 2005 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations to: (1) designate certain combinations of chemical sources and substances of concern as high priority categories based on the severity of the threat posed by an unauthorized release from the chemical sources; and (2) require each owner and operator of a high priority category chemical source to conduct an assessment of the vulnerability of the source to a terrorist attack or other unauthorized release, identify hazards that may result from an unauthorized release, and prepare a prevention, preparedness, and response plan. Directs: (1) the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide owners and operators of chemical sources with relevant threat information; (2) each such owner and operator to certify that it has conducted such assessments, completed such plan, and reviewed the adequacy of the assessment or plan; and (3) the Administrator to develop protocols necessary to protect copies of such assessments and plans from unauthorized disclosure. Directs the Administrator: (1) to establish a publicly available clearinghouse to compile and disseminate information on the use and availability of inherently safer technologies; (2) and the Secretary of Energy to establish and administer a Technology Transition Fund to provide grants to assist chemical facilities that demonstrate financial hardship in implementing inherently safer technologies; and (3) to make grants to provide for training of first responders and of employees at chemical sources in identifying opportunities to reduce the chemical source's vulnerability to a release of a substance of concern through the use of safer technologies or in emergency response procedures. Sets forth provisions regarding Administrator: (1) certifications of source compliance with assessment and plan requirements; (2) provision of compliance assistance; (3) authorization to order compliance; and (4) actions to secure relief necessary to abate a terrorist threat. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for source violations.</summary>
