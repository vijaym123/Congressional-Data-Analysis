  <summary>9/29/2005--Passed House amended.
Threatened and Endangered Species Recovery Act of 2005 - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) to revise various provisions of that Act relating to determinations of endangered or threatened species, recovery plans for such species, and the role of states and private property owners in protecting such species. (Sec. 3) Defines "best available scientific data" as scientific data, regardless of source, that are available to the Secretary of the Interior at the time of a decision or action for which such data are required by ESA and that the Secretary determines are the most accurate, reliable, and relevant for use in that decision or action. (The Secretary of the Interior has primary responsibility for enforcing ESA, but the Secretaries of Agriculture and of Commerce also have certain program responsibilities under ESA.) Requires the Secretary to: (1) issue regulations to establish criteria for determining which data constitute the best available scientific data; and (2) take steps to secure the best available scientific data. Redefines "permit or license applicant" as any person who has applied to a federal agency for a permit or license or for formal legal approval to perform an act. (Sec. 4) Revises criteria for making determinations of endangered or threatened species. Requires the Secretary to make such determinations only sparingly and to prepare an analysis when such determinations are made of the economic, national security, and other relevant impacts and benefits of such determinations. Substitutes the criteria of "best available scientific data" for "best scientific and commercial data available" in making determinations of endangered or threatened species. Requires the Secretary to consider information contained in recovery plan biennial reports to Congress and any other relevant information in conducting the five-year reviews of lists of endangered or threatened species required by ESA. (Sec. 5) Repeals the authority of the Secretary to designate critical habitats. (Sec. 6) Prohibits the Secretary from finding that a petition to add or remove a species from the endangered or threatened species list presents substantial scientific or commercial information unless the petitioner provides the Secretary with a copy of all information cited in such petition. Requires the Secretary to provide notice of any regulation, including emergency regulations, implementing an endangered or threatened species determination, designation, or revision to the governor of a state, as well as the appropriate state agency. Requires the Secretary to: (1) make available on the Internet a complete record of all information concerning the determination or revision of an endangered or threatened species listing; (2) include in such record any status review, all information cited in such review, and all information submitted by third parties; and (3) withhold from public review information protected by the Administrative Procedures Act. (Sec. 7) Requires the Secretary in reviewing any proposed change in the status of an endangered or threatened species to consider: (1) criteria identified in a recovery plan or criteria established by ESA; (2) a finding of fundamental error in an initial determination; and (3) a determination that a species is no longer an endangered or threatened species or in danger of extinction. (Sec. 8) Provides that the governor of a state, a county, or a unit or local government, as well as the appropriate state agency, may comment on ESA regulations proposed by the Secretary. (Sec. 9) Revises ESA recovery plan provisions to require the Secretary to give priority in developing recovery plans to species that are most likely to benefit from such plans, particularly species that are in conflict with economic development activity. Sets forth deadlines for the publication of recovery plans. Requires recovery plans to be based upon the best available scientific data and to include objective, measurable criteria for making endangered or threatened species determinations and alternative species protection measures that are least costly. Directs the Secretary to: (1) issue regulations to establish recovery teams for the development of recovery plans; (2) provide biennial reports to Congress on the status of all domestic endangered or threatened species and the status of efforts to develop and implement recovery plans; and (3) consult with states, Indian tribes, or regional or local land use agencies prior to the approval of a new or revised recovery plan. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into species recovery agreements and species conservation contract agreements with persons, other than federal or state agencies, to provide incentives for species recovery and conservation activities. Requires the Secretary to make anuual payments to such persons to implement the agreements. Prohibits the Secretary, or any other federal official, from coercing any individual to participate in such an agreement. (Sec. 10) Revises provisions relating to cooperative agreements between the Secretary and states and Indian tribes to allow such agreements to: (1) cover a candidate species or any other species that the Secretary and the state agree is at risk of being determined an endangered or threatened species in that state; (2) provide for monitoring, or monitoring assistance, for candidate and recovered species; and (3) require that any agreement to enroll private lands or water rights be made on a voluntary basis. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend or terminate a cooperative agreement under certain conditions, after consultation with the governor of an affected state. (Sec. 11) Revises provisions relating to federal interagency cooperation and consultations under ESA. Applies the best available scientific data standard to such consultations. Authorizes the Secretary to adopt by regulation alternative procedures for consultations with federal agencies taking actions that may jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species (jeopardy analysis). Requires federal agencies or the Secretary, in conducting any jeopardy analysis, to consider only the effects of any agency actions that are distinct from a baseline of all effects upon the species that have occurred or are occurring prior to such actions. Requires the Secretary to consider any comment from a federal agency and a permit or license applicant before issuing a final written opinion (incidental take statement) on the effect of a federal agency action on an endangered or threatened species and to publish notice of such written opinion in the Federal Register. Requires that terms and conditions imposed upon an agency or applicant be roughly proportional to the impact of the incidental taking identified in the Secretary's written opinion. Eliminates the Endangered Species Committee and the process for obtaining federal agency exemptions under ESA. (Sec. 12) Modifies provisions relating to incidental take permits to require habitat conservation plans submitted with a permit application to include: (1) objective, measurable biological goals to be achieved for the species and specific measures for achieving such goals; (2) measures for monitoring impacts of such plans on species; and (3) adaptive management provisions. Requires that the terms and conditions offered by the Secretary to reduce or offset the impacts of incidental taking shall be roughly proportional to the impact of the incidental taking. Preserves the authority of the Secretary to require greater than acre-for acre mitigation when necessary to address the extent of such impacts. Extends (from 30 to 45 days) the period for public review and comment on applications for incidental take permits. Permits a private property owner to request a written determination from the Secretary that a proposed use of the owner's property complies with ESA take avoidance requirements. Authorizes the President to waive requirements under ESA if necessary for national security or in the event of a federally-declared major disaster. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations for the application of ESA in an emergency involving a threat to human health or safety or to property.
