Requires the Assistant Secretary, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National Community Service, to: (1) encourage and permit voluntary groups active in supportive services and civic engagement to participate in such programs or activities; (2) develop a comprehensive strategy for utilizing older individuals to address critical local needs of national concern, including through activities of pubic and nonprofit organizations such as community-based and faith-based organizations; and (3) encourage other community capacity building initiatives involving older individuals, with particular attention to initiatives that demonstrate the effectiveness and cost savings in meeting critical needs.
