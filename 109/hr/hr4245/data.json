Requires the United States Geological Survey to carry out an interagency effort to detect avian influenza in wild birds. Provides for the expansion and intensification of influenza research. Requires the Director of CDC to expand and intensify Global Disease Detection Initiative efforts. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) a proposal to study the feasibility of establishing a Pandemic Fund to support pandemic influenza control and relief activities.
