Amends the 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery From and Response To Terrorist Attacks on the United States to: (1) extend Federal Law Enforcement Training Center authority to appoint and maintain a cadre of federal annuitants; and (2) increase the maximum number of such annuitants from 250 to 350. Authorizes the Commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to appoint and employ (for up to five years) up to 500 federal annuitants for CBP border-related positions. Authorizes the Secretary to use specified security and terrorism prevention grant funds for border security activities."
