Authorizes the Secretary to make emergency grants to entities providing care to homeless veterans for repairing or replacing facilities damaged or destroyed by a disaster. Directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance to eligible entities to provide supportive services for very low income veteran families residing in permanent housing. Requires the equitable distribution of such assistance across geographic regions, including rural communities and tribal lands. Requires the Secretary to carry out a demonstration program on preventing homelessness of veterans who are at risk of homelessness after they are discharged or released from active military service. Makes permanent and extends to at least 12 (currently, six) locations a VA demonstration program of referral and counseling services for veterans transitioning from certain institutions (including penal and mental illness institutions) who are at-risk for homelessness."
