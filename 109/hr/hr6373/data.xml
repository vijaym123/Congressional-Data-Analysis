Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) to convey to Resolution Copper Mining, LLC, all, right, title, and interest of the United States in and to specified federal land in Pinal county, Arizona, in exchange for Resolution Copper conveying to the United States title to: (1) the Secretary to specified non-federal land in Gila, Yavapai, Maricopa, Pinal, and Coconino counties, Arizona, and (2) the Secretary of the Interior to specified non-federal land in Pinal, Santa Cruz, and Gila counties, Arizona.
