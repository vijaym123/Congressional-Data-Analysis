Requires the Secretary, in carrying out this section, to comply with the requirements of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act regarding the use of consensus technical standards by federal agencies and departments. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to complete the establishment of the Technology Clearinghouse. Requires the establishment of a homeland security technology transfer program to facilitate the identification, modification, and commercialization of technology and equipment for use to prevent, prepare for, or respond to acts of terrorism or other emergencies. Requires activities of the program to include: (1) identifying available technologies that have been, or are in the process of being, developed, tested, evaluated, or demonstrated by DHS, other federal agencies, the private sector, or foreign governments and international organizations, and reviewing whether such technologies may be useful; and (2) communicating the availability of such technologies, as well as the technology's specifications, satisfaction of appropriate standards, and the appropriate grants available from DHS to purchase such technologies. Specifies the responsibilities of the Under Secretary, in supporting such activities, including to: (1) enter into agreements and coordinate with other federal agencies, foreign governments, and national and international organizations, as appropriate, in order to maximize the effectiveness of such technologies or to facilitate commercialization of such technologies; and (2) establish a working group in coordination with the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to advise and assist the Clearinghouse in the identification of military technologies by DOD or the private sector. Requires the Under Secretary to transmit to Congress a description of the progress DHS has made in implementing the provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (relating to the Clearinghouse), including a description of the process used to review unsolicited proposals received as described under such Act. (Sec. 4) Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to terminate the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Advisory Committee ten years after its establishment. (Sec. 5) Directs the Under Secretary to provide technical guidance, training, and other assistance, as appropriate, to support the transfer and integration of homeland security technologies and protocols in urban and other high risk jurisdictions determined by the Secretary to be at consistently high levels of risk from terrorist attack. Requires the Under Secretary, in setting out priorities for and carrying out the activities described in this section, to consult and coordinate with appropriate governors, mayors, other state and local government officials, and first responders. (Sec. 6) Directs the Under Secretary to support research and development, including fundamental, long-term research, in cybersecurity to improve the ability of the United States to prevent against, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber attacks, with emphasis on research and development relevant to large-scale, high-impact attacks. Requires the Under Secretary, in carrying out this section, to coordinate with the assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Telecommunications and other federal agencies, including those specified. Instructs that activities under this section be carried out in accordance with provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 regarding classification. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 7) Directs the Under Secretary to establish a program to support the development and promulgation of national voluntary consensus standards for requirements, performance testing, and user training with respect to critical infrastructure information systems. Requires submission to Congress of: (1) a report describing the plan for carrying out such program, which includes a schedule for the development of national voluntary consensus standards for critical infrastructure information systems; and (2) a report which includes a description of the steps taken under this program and the funding dedicated to this program and the steps that have been or will be taken to promote the adoption of such standards by appropriate standard-setting organizations. (Sec. 8) Instructs the Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary, to encourage the development of an adequate supply of people trained in and performing research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematical fields relevant to homeland security. Allows the Secretary to support: (1) programs at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, including at historically black colleges and universities that are Part B institutions and minority institutions; and (2) internship programs that take advantage of the homeland security research infrastructure available to DHS, including laboratories owned or operated by DHS, the Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories, and University Centers of Excellence. (Sec. 9) Requires the Under Secretary, in consultation with the Chief Privacy Officer and the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, to transmit a report to Congress on existing visual surveillance systems supported or utilized by DHS. Requires the visual surveillance systems covered in such report to include all systems for which: (1) DHS provided funds for development, procurement, or implementation of the system; or (2) DHS has access to the data gathered through the system. Requires the Under Secretary, in consultation with the Chief Privacy Officer and the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, to transmit a report to Congress evaluating the use and effectiveness of existing visual surveillance systems supported or utilized by DHS. Instructs that such report shall, for at least six systems that are representative of the systems listed in such report: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of systems in meeting goals; (2) review the privacy policies and implications; (3) review the civil rights and civil liberties policies and implications; (4) describe any lessons learned from implementation; and (5) describe any remaining questions about the effectiveness and the privacy and civil liberties implications of such systems that cannot be addressed by this evaluation of surveillance systems and that may require demonstration programs to study. Authorizes the Under Secretary, based on the results of that evaluation and in consultation with the Chief Privacy Officer and the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of DHS, to establish a demonstration project to assess the effectiveness and the privacy and civil liberties implications of utilizing visual surveillance systems to enhance homeland security. Requires such demonstration project to thoroughly consider and incorporate best practices from within the United States and abroad, including from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Provides that, Requires the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, if visual surveillance of a mass transit facility is included in the demonstration project, to consult with the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Security Administration and to ensure that the goals of such project are consistent with the research and development requirements of the National Strategy for Transportation Security. (Sec. 10) Requires the Under Secretary, the Chief Privacy Officer, and the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to transmit to Congress a joint plan for how privacy and civil rights and civil liberties issues will be considered in technology research and development programs at DHS, including how such issues will be taken into account in defining requirements for technology performance and use of technologies in pilot programs.
