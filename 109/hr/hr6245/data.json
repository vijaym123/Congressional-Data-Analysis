Authorizes necessary adjustments in such boundaries, except any that would place any portion of the Trail in such Wilderness. Sets forth provisions concerning permitted and prohibited activities, water rights, and mineral resources within such Wilderness. Permits the Secretary to acquire private land within the Wilderness with the owner's consent. Allows water project development if authorized by the Secretary or President. Sets forth provisions governing continued operations at the Grand River Ditch. Applies provisions governing leases of National Park System buildings and property to property known as the Leiffer tract near the Park's eastern boundary in Larimer County, Colorado, as if such property was part of the Park."
