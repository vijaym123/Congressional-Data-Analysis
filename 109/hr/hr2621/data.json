    "text": "Bounty Hunter Responsibility Act of 2005 - Declares that a surety on a bail bond, an agent of such surety, or any bounty hunter seeking to obtain or exercise custody over a person admitted to bail under state law is acting under color of law for purposes of establishing civil or criminal liability for the deprivation of federally protected rights. Considers a bounty hunter as an agent of the surety if such bounty hunter is acting as an independent contractor or employee of the surety. Requires each surety on a bail bond, agent of such surety, and bounty hunter to inform the local law enforcement agency of the presence of such agent, surety, and bounty hunter and of that individual's intention to seek to obtain or exercise custody over a person admitted to bail outside that state, before commencing activities in the state. Directs the Attorney General to publish model guidelines for state control and regulation of persons employed or applying for employment as bounty hunters, which shall include recommendations as to whether a person seeking employment as a bounty hunter should be: (1) allowed to obtain such employment if that person has been convicted of a felony; (2) required to complete a basic certification course in the criminal justice system or a handgun training course; or (3) required to submit to a criminal background check."
