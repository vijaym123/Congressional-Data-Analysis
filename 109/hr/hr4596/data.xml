  <summary>12/16/2005--Introduced.
Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act - Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2011 to: (1) the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for support of basic research activities in the physical sciences, mathematics and computer sciences, and engineering; and (2) the Department of Defense (DOD) for support of basic research activities. Makes at least 8% of such amounts available for high-risk, potentially high-payoff research. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2011 to the NSF, National Institutes of Health (NIH), DOE, DOD, and NASA for the support of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers program. Directs NSF to institute the Graduate Scholar Awards in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics program or GSA-STEM program, to award graduate fellowships in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Requires the NSF Director to establish an advisory board. Establishes a Presidential Innovation Award, which the President shall periodically award to individuals who develop one or more unique scientific or engineering ideas in the national interest. Directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish a National Coordination Office for Research Infrastructure to: (1) identify and prioritize deficiencies in research facilities and instrumentation in academic institutions and national laboratories; and (2) make recommendations for resource allocation. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2011 to NSF and DOE for construction and maintenance of research facilities at institutions of higher education or national laboratories and other physical resources for performing leading-edge research.</summary>
