Directs the Department of Agriculture to establish a tracking system to regulate the growing, handling, transportation, and disposal of all pharmaceutical and industrial crops and their byproducts to prevent contamination. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to assess civil penalties for violations of such provisions. Directs the National Academy of Sciences to report on alternative methods to produce pharmaceuticals or industrial chemicals that may be conducted in controlled production facilities without the risk of contamination. Defines: (1) \"genetically engineered plant\"; (2) \"genetically engineered material\"; (3) \"genetically engineered seed\"; (4) \"pharmaceutical crop\"; and (5) \"industrial crop.\""
