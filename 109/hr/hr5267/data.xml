  <summary>5/2/2006--Introduced.
Genetically Engineered Pharmaceutical and Industrial Crop Safety Act of 2005 [sic] - Prohibits: (1) a pharmaceutical crop or industrial crop to be grown, raised, or otherwise cultivated until the final regulations and tracking system required by this Act are in effect; and (2) cultivation of a pharmaceutical crop or industrial crop in an open air environment, or in a food commonly used for human food or domestic animal feed. Directs the Department of Agriculture to establish a tracking system to regulate the growing, handling, transportation, and disposal of all pharmaceutical and industrial crops and their byproducts to prevent contamination. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to assess civil penalties for violations of such provisions. Directs the National Academy of Sciences to report on alternative methods to produce pharmaceuticals or industrial chemicals that may be conducted in controlled production facilities without the risk of contamination. Defines: (1) "genetically engineered plant"; (2) "genetically engineered material"; (3) "genetically engineered seed"; (4) "pharmaceutical crop"; and (5) "industrial crop."</summary>
