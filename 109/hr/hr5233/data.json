Prescribes implementation guidelines, including agency reserves for housing choice vouchers. Requires the Secretary to provide to Congress and make publicly available specified budget information. Sets forth guidelines for maximized leasing that prohibit the Secretary from: (1) taking into consideration the extent to which the number of families assisted in the preceding year by an agency exceeded the authorized level; or (2) establishing or enforcing any limitation on the number of families, vouchers, or units or unit-months that may be assisted with amounts provided for tenant-based rental assistance."
