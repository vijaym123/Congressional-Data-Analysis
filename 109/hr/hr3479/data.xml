  <summary>7/27/2005--Introduced.
Internet Safety and Child Protection Act of 2005 - Requires: (1) an operator of a regulated pornographic website to verify (using Federal Trade Commission (FTC)-certified software) that any user attempting to access its site is age 18 or older; (2) a bank, credit card company, third-party merchant, Internet payment service provider, or business that performs financial transactions for such a website to only process age-verified Internet pornography credit card transactions; (3) the FTC to require use of appropriate age-screening software and maintain a list of websites that do not comply; and (4) violations of the age verification requirement to be treated as a Federal Trade Commission Act violation. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose upon the operator of a regulated pornographic website for any Internet pornography display or distribution a tax equal to 25 percent of the amounts charged. Establishes in the Treasury the Internet Safety and Child Protection Trust Fund into which such taxes shall be deposited. Requires Fund amounts to be allocated (in order of priority) for: (1) federal agencies to enforce this Act; (2) the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to ensure that the cyber tip line is fully operational and staffed 24 hours a day; (3) states to support Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces; (4) companies to support research and development into new filtering technologies; (5) state agencies to support educational training; and (6) specified federal agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofits to support child Internet safety activities, including combating sex trafficking and sex crimes against children.</summary>
