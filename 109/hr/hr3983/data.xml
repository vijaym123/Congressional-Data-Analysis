  <summary>10/6/2005--Introduced.
Winter Readiness Act of 2005 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a taxpayer election to expense (i.e., deduct in the current taxable year) all costs for qualified oil and gas production property placed in service before January 1, 2009, and for repairs to such property for hurricane-related damage. Defines "qualified oil and gas production property" to include assets used in offshore drilling for oil and gas, and for exploration and production of petroleum and natural gas deposits. Allows a 10-year carryback of net operating losses incurred in 2005 for hurricane-damaged oil and gas facilities.</summary>
