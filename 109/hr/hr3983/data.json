Defines \"qualified oil and gas production property\" to include assets used in offshore drilling for oil and gas, and for exploration and production of petroleum and natural gas deposits. Allows a 10-year carryback of net operating losses incurred in 2005 for hurricane-damaged oil and gas facilities."
