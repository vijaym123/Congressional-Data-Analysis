Allows the Secretary to terminate a state's participation in the pilot program if it fails for three consecutive years to demonstrate adequate yearly progress toward achieving challenging academic performance standards. Requires the equitable participation of private schools in the use of such grants. Provides for awards to states for reducing achievement gaps."
