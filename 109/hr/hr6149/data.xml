  <summary>9/21/2006--Introduced.
Gulf Coast Housing Accessibility Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to allocate additional assistance for project-based housing vouchers for individuals and households located within the disaster areas of Hurricane Katrina, Rita, or Wilma of 2005. Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to set forth conditions for providing permanent and semipermanent housing units. Instructs the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to: (1) enter into a mission assignment with the Secretary for a transfer of FEMA Disaster Relief Funds into the Disaster Voucher Program at the Department of Housing and Urban Development; and (2) transfer into the Disaster Voucher Program individuals and households receiving transitional housing, rental, or other related assistance. Permits such individuals and families to opt-out of such a transfer.</summary>
