Provides for the immediate removal of private property included within the boundaries of the Area upon request from the owner. Prohibits the Alliance from using federal funds received under this Act to acquire real property. Prohibits the acquisition of any land or interest in land by the Secretary of the Interior or the Alliance under this Act without the owner's consent. Requires the Alliance to prepare and submit a management plan for the Area. Allows the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the Alliance for the purpose of carrying out the plan. Prohibits any privately owned property from being preserved, conserved, or promoted by the plan unless the owner gives the Alliance consent for such preservation, conservation, or promotion after receiving notification from the Alliance of the proposed preservation, conservation, or promotion. Specifies private property protections. Terminates the authority of the Secretary to provide financial assistance to the Alliance (excluding technical assistance and administrative oversight) under the Act ten years after enactment of this Act."
