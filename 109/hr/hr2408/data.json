Requires the fee to be due 50 years after the date of first publication or on December 31, 2006, whichever occurs later, and every ten years thereafter until the end of the copyright term. Terminates the copyright unless payment of the applicable maintenance fee is received in the Copyright Office on or before its due date or within a grace period of six months thereafter. Deems any ancillary or promotional work used in connection with the maintained work, such as an advertisement for a motion picture, also to be maintained in force. Requires the: (1) maintenance fee to be accompanied by a form prescribed by the Register; and (2) the Register to establish procedures to minimize the burden of submitting the form, including procedures to allow the electronic submission of the form, and to make the information contained in such forms easily accessible to the public."
