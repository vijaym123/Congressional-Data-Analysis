  <summary>6/20/2006--Introduced.
Safe Overseas Human Testing Act - Allows test articles intended for clinical investigations to be exported only pursuant to an export license approved by the President. Directs the President to require an applicant for such license to: (1) identify each clinical investigation for which the test article is intended; and (2) secure a certification from an institutional review board that each of the protocols for every clinical investigation has been reviewed by the board and has met substantially the same standards for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects as would be required if the protocol were for a clinical investigation of the test article pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</summary>
