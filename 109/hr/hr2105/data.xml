  <summary>5/4/2005--Introduced.
Amends Federal highway law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to transfer a specified percentage of Federal-aid highway program funds apportioned to a State to its apportionment of highway safety program funds, if the State has not enacted a child safety restraint law. Requires the State to use such transferred funds to implement a statewide comprehensive child and other passenger protection education program to promote child and other passenger safety, including education programs about proper seating positions for children in air bag-equipped motor vehicles and instruction that increases the proper use of child restraint systems.</summary>
