  <summary>9/13/2005--Introduced.
Fostering Our Future Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to state courts to build capacity to track and analyze foster care caseloads and performance measures under the Omnibus Budget Reconcilation Act of 1993, as amended by this Act. Requires such grants to be made to the highest state courts in states participating in the program of federal payments for foster care and adoption assistance under part E of title IV of the Social Security Act. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 to condition eligibility for certain grants on specified measures of foster care court performance. Amends Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a program of student loan forgiveness for certain family law, dependency, or domestic relations attorneys. Directs the Comptroller General to do a comparative study of state dependency courts and foster care systems. Expresses the sense of Congress with respect to: (1) court accountability for improved child outcomes; (2) the organization of state dependency courts; (3) building the pool of attorneys qualified to handle cases in dependency courts; and (5) training, caseloads, and compensation of attorneys for children.</summary>
