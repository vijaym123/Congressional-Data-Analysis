  <summary>7/21/2005--Introduced.
Sexual Predator Effective Monitoring Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants and contracts to assist state and local governments in: (1) carrying out programs to outfit sexual offenders with electronic monitoring units; and (2) employing law enforcement officials necessary to carry out such programs. Defines a "sexual offender" as an offender 18 years of age or older who commits a sexual offense against a minor. Directs the Attorney General to ensure that each state with eligible programs receives a proportional share of funding based on the total number of eligible states and the population of sex offenders to be monitored with global positioning systems in those states.</summary>
