  <summary>6/7/2006--Passed Senate amended.
Amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to allow the redaction of a judicial employee's or judicial officer's statutorily required financial disclosure information if a finding is made by the Judicial Conference that the release of such information could endanger the judicial employee or judicial officer or a family member of that employee or officer. (Currently, redaction is allowed only if the employee or officer is endangered.) Extends the redaction provisions (retroactive to their last expiration) through 2007.</summary>
