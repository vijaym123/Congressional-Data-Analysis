Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to require random screenings and inspections until such deadline is met. Authorizes the Secretary to hire additional passenger and baggage screeners to ensure aviation security. Directs the Secretary to require airport personnel accessing airport sterile areas from unrestricted areas to undergo security screening. Requires the Secretary to ensure that all unescorted airport personnel accessing airport sterile and secured areas have undergone a background check. Directs the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration) to report to Congress on ongoing efforts and projected timelines for: (1) developing and implementing uniform screening standards for airport personnel with access to sterile areas; (2) completing, and making available to airport operators, an assessment of available technologies applicable to securing airport perimeters; and (3) developing and implementing a standardized approach to conducting airport vulnerability assessments and compliance inspections."
