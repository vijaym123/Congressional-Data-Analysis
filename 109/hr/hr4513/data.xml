  <summary>12/13/2005--Introduced.
Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Temporary Extension Act of 2005 - Amends the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to extend its sunset date from December 31, 2005, to March 31, 2006. Extends to Program Year 3 (January 1, 2005-December 31, 2005) the period during which insurers are required to make property and casualty insurance coverage available for insured losses. Repeals the requirement, however, that such coverage may not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism.</summary>
