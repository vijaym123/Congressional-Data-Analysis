    "text": "Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit: (1) entry by false pretenses to a secure area of a seaport; (2) knowingly failing to obey an order to heave to by an authorized federal law enforcement officer; (3) forcibly interfering with an authorized law enforcement action or providing materially false information during a boarding; and (4) willfully disabling a passenger vehicle. Sets penalties for: (1) knowingly and intentionally placing in U.S. navigable waters a device or dangerous substance likely to destroy or damage a vessel or its cargo or likely to interfere with safe navigation or maritime commerce; (2) intentionally damaging or altering any aid to maritime navigation which endangers the safe navigation of a ship; and (3) transporting aboard any vessel explosive, biological, chemical, or radioactive or nuclear material to be used to commit terrorism. Sets penalties for: (1) knowingly transporting a terrorist aboard any vessel; (2) willfully causing destruction of, disabling, or interfering with the operation of a vessel or maritime facility; and (3) imparting or conveying false information concerning an attempt made to commit criminal acts related to shipping. Expands the scope of a prohibition against theft of interstate or foreign shipments. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to increase penalties for noncompliance with manifest requirements and to expand the scope of those requirements to cover any responsible party, including non-vessel operating common carriers. Increases penalties for stowaways on vessels or aircraft. Prohibits bribery affecting port security."
