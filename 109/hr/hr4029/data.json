    "text": "Fuel Price Fairness Act - Authorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to declare a national or regional energy price emergency if it finds that the health, safety, welfare, or economic well-being of U.S. citizens, or a region of the United States, is at risk because of a shortage or imminent shortage of adequate supplies of crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, or home heating oil due to a disruption of distribution systems for crude oil, gasoline, natural gas, or petroleum distillates, or significant pricing anomalies in national or regional energy markets for those products are more than temporary. Requires an integrated oil company or refinery to disclose to the FTC during such emergency: (1) the prevailing price of crude oil and wholesale price of refined gasoline, diesel, home heating oil, based on invoices, for each week during the period of 60 days immediately preceding the declaration of an energy emergency; and (2) the prevailing price of crude oil and wholesale price of refined gasoline, diesel, home heating oil, based on invoices, for each week of the period in which a national price emergency is in effect. Declares unlawful during such a national energy price emergency: (1) for any person to sell at retail gasoline, diesel fuel, or home heating oil at an unreasonable price; and (2) for any integrated oil company or refinery to sell those products at an unreasonable price. Subjects such integrated oil company or refinery to criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Grants the FTC enforcement powers under this Act."
