Global Trade Requires Unmitigated Truth in Health (TRUTH) Act - Requires the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to: (1) propose to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that its rights and obligations should take into account whether countries are undermining the trade system by failing to abide by the rules of other international organizations with regard to public health, specifically the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization; and (2) include in the proposal specified options for its implementation. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and specified congressional committees on the status of the compliance with and observance of such Regulations in each member country of the Organization.</summary>
