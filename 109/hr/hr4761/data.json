    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "2006-06-29", 
    "text": "Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act of 2006 - (Sec. 4) Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to revise the determination of adjacent zones and planning areas in the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf (OCS). (Sec. 5) Prescribes or revises guidelines for: (1) natural gas lease administration; (2) lease grants; (3) treatment of lease receipts from tracts within 100 miles of the Coastline and from tracts beyond 100 miles of the Coastline; and (4) allocations to adjacent or producing states and coastal municipal political subdivisions. (Sec. 7) Prescribes requirements for receipts sharing from tracts within within or beyond 100 miles from any coastline. Authorizes the use of shared funds for any purpose as determined by state law, including: (1) reduction of instate college tuition; (2) transportation infrastructure improvements; (3) tax reduction; (4) coastal or environmental restoration; (5) improvement of infrastructure associated with OCS energy production activities; (6) funding of energy demonstration projects and supporting infrastructure for energy projects; and (7) matching funds for other federal programs. Declares that no state or local government recipient of funds shall be required to account to the federal government for their expenditure, unless otherwise provided by law. (Sec. 8) Authorizes the President to revise or revoke for a ten-year term any prior withdrawal made by the President. Prohibits the President from: (1) revising or revoking a withdrawal that is extended by a state; or (2) withdrawing from leasing any area for which a state failed to prohibit, or petition to prohibit, leasing. Declares that not more than 25% of the acreage of any OCS Planning Area may be withdrawn from leasing in the area of the Outer Continental Shelf more than 100 miles from any coastline. Prohibits the Secretary from offering, without state request, leases for oil, gas, or natural gas on any area within 50 miles of the coastline that was withdrawn under a certain Memorandum from disposition by leasing in the Atlantic OCS Region, the Pacific OCS Region, or the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region Eastern Planning Area (as depicted on specified maps), or any such area that was not withdrawn under such Memorandum within the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region Eastern Planning Area or within the Florida Straits Planning Area. Instructs the Secretary to offer for leasing any area between 50 and 100 miles from the coastline that was withdrawn under such Memorandum from disposition by leasing in the Atlantic OCS Region, the Pacific OCS Region, or the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region Eastern Planning Area, as depicted on specified maps, unless an adjacent state petitions for leasing natural gas, oil, or gas by specified deadlines. Requires leasing offers in any areas in that range that were not withdrawn under such Memorandum within the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region Eastern Planning Area or within the Florida Straits Planning Area. Prescribes procedural guidelines for states to petition for leasing in the Adjacent Zone (that is, to opt out of any withdrawals). Directs the Secretary to amend the current Five-Year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program to include lease sales for at least 75% of the associated areas. Prescribes requirements for state extensions of the withdrawal from leasing within certain OCS areas. Prohibits the offer for oil or natural gas leasing of any OCS area located in the Gulf of Mexico east of a specified military mission line. (Sec. 9) Amends the OCS leasing program to require the Secretary, in each five-year program, to include lease sales that, when viewed as a whole, propose to offer at least 75% of the available unleased acreage within each OCS Planning Area for oil, gas or natural gas leasing. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide to each adjacent state a current estimate of proven and potential oil and gas resources located within its adjacent zone; and (2) provide to each such state and its coastal political subdivisions a best-efforts projection of the OCS receipts that the Secretary expects will be shared with them. (Sec. 10) Prohibits a federal agency from permitting, without the concurrence of the adjacent state, the construction of a crude oil or petroleum products pipeline within the part of the adjacent state's adjacent zone that is withdrawn from oil and gas or natural gas leasing, unless at least 50% of the production projected to be carried by the pipeline within its first 10 years of operation is from areas of the adjacent state's adjacent zone. Prohibits a state from denying within its adjacent zone or its state waters construction of a natural gas pipeline that will transport OCS natural gas. Permits, however, an adjacent state to prevent a proposed natural gas pipeline landing location if it proposes two alternate landing locations in the adjacent state, acceptable to the adjacent state, and located within 50 miles on either side of the proposed landing location. (Sec. 11) Declares that, for all programs, lease sales, leases, and actions subject to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, lease suspensions and all preliminary activities on OCS tracks are excluded categorically from the need to prepare environmental assessments or environmental impact statements (EIS's). Exempts from further environmental analysis the EIS developed in support of each five-year oil and gas leasing program. Exempts exploration plans from any requirement to prepare an EIS. Limits development and production plans to one EIS every 10 years and environmental assessments only within any 10-year period. (Sec. 13) Federal Energy Natural Resources Enhancement Act of 2006 - Establishes the Federal Energy Natural Resources Enhancement Program for the monitoring and management of wildlife and fish, and air, water, and other natural resources related to energy and minerals development on federal lands, onshore and offshore. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2017. Requires annual payments of one-third of Program appropriations to the Secretary, and the availability of the other two-thirds to the states, to secure the necessary trained workforce or contractual services to conduct environmental studies, planning, development, monitoring, and post-development management of wildlife and fish and air, water, and other natural resources that may be related to biobased fuel, gas, mineral, oil, wind, or other energy exploration, development, transportation, transmission, and associated activities on federal onshore and offshore lands. (Sec. 14) Declares without force or effect all provisions of existing federal law that prohibit spending appropriated funds for OCS oil and natural gas leasing and preleasing. (Sec. 15) Prohibits a federal agency from permitting certain activities on federal OCS or in state waters that are incompatible with either oil or natural gas leasing and substantially full exploration and production of tracts that are geologically prospective for oil or natural gas.
