Allows a State to use such grants to: (1) reimburse an employer or eligible individual for premiums or other costs for coverage under health plans; (2) offset the cost of enrolling individuals in Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP); and (3) subsidize the cost of health benefits coverage to eligible individuals. Sets forth a formula for determining the amounts of such grants to be allotted to U.S. territories, Indian tribes, and States, including as factors the relative numbers of children under five years old and children receiving free or reduced lunches in a State. Directs the Secretary to evaluate several State programs representing various approaches to raising the rate of child care workers with health benefits coverage."
