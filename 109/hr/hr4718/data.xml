Defines "gift" as any gift, fee, payment, subsidy, or other economic benefit with a value of $50 or more, except free samples of prescription drugs and the payment of reasonable compensation and reimbursement of expenses in connection with a bona fide clinical trial. Requires the Commissioner to: (1) make such information available to the public; and (2) keep confidential any information related to a trade secret. Establishes civil penalties for violations.</summary>
