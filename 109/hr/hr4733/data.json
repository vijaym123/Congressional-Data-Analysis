    "text": "Stand Up for America Act of 2006 - Establishes in the legislative branch an Office of the Congressional Trade Enforcer to ensure compliance by U.S. trading partners with international trade agreements to which the United States is a party. Establishes the Office of Market Access Assistance within such Office to provide technical and legal assistance and advice to eligible small businesses enabling them to prepare and file petitions (other than those that are frivolous) under the Trade Act of 1974. Amends the Act to extend indefinitely (currently, 1995 only) the Congressional Trade Enforcer's (currently, U.S. Trade Representative's) mandate to identify and report on trade expansion priorities. Requires the report to identify priority foreign country practices of currency manipulation. Requires the Trade Representative, before initiating an investigation (as under current law), to seek consultations with each foreign country identified in the report as engaging in priority foreign country practices, for the purpose of reaching a satisfactory resolution of such priority practices. Requires initiation of an investigation only if a satisfactory resolution of such practices has not been reached. Requires the Congressional Trade Enforcer: (1) to identify and report to Congress on priority foreign trade practices of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Russian Federation, and the European Union; and (2) as part of the report's analysis, to consider violations by the PRC and the Russian Federation of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules regarding the protection of intellectual property rights, violations by the PRC of WTO rules regarding the manipulation of currency, and violations by the European Union of WTO rules regarding discriminatory regional trade agreements."
