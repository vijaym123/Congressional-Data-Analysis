(Currently the Secretary is also prohibited from reducing the amount of the grant based solely on one of such factors.) Provides that title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (nondiscrimination under federally assisted programs) and title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing) shall not apply to actions by federally recognized Indian tribes (or their instrumentalities) under this Act. Amends the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act to make Indian tribes, tribally designated housing entities, or other agencies primarily serving Indians eligible for Youthbuild grants. Terminates the current ineligibility of such entities for Youthbuild grants at the end of FY2005."
