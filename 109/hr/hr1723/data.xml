  <summary>4/20/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for investment in qualified reclamation property. Defines "qualified reclamation property" as tangible depreciable recycling or remanufacturing property with a useful life of at least five years. Limits the amount of such credit to 20 percent of the basis (not exceeding $10 million) of qualified reclamation property placed in service during a taxable year. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study the performance and safety of recycled, non-deployed airbags used in automobiles.</summary>
