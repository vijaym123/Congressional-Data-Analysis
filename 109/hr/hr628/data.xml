  <summary>2/8/2005--Introduced.
Flu Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to conduct, annually, a public influenza awareness campaign and education and outreach efforts preceding the flu season. Requires the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to urge early and full preordering of the influenza vaccine by Medicare providers. Requires the Director to: (1) work with the Administrator to publish influenza immunization rates among Medicare recipients; (2) support the development of State adult immunization programs that emphasize improving influenza vaccine delivery to high-risk populations and the general population; and (3) work with appropriate agencies to assess the efficacy of the influenza vaccine. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a vaccine manufacturing facilities investment tax credit (20 percent of qualifying property per year) for property placed in service by December 31, 2009. Requires the Director to: (1) enter into contracts with manufacturers to produce additional necessary doses of the influenza vaccine; and (2) develop a contingency plan for maximizing influenza immunization for high-risk populations in the event of a delay or shortage of the vaccine. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director, to establish a protocol to prevent, prepare for, and respond to an influenza pandemic or epidemic. Requires a manufacturer that receives Federal authority to distribute a vaccine to provide the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with advance notice of such manufacturer's intent to stop marketplace distribution of the vaccine.</summary>
