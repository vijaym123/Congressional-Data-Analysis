Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2006 - States that the purpose of this Act is to provide for the development, as a core mission of the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), of an expert civilian response capability to carry out stabilization and reconstruction activities in a country or region that is in, or is in transition from, conflict or civil strife. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide assistance in stabilizing and reconstructing a country or region that is at risk of, in, or is in transition from, conflict or civil strife. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to establish within the Department an Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization, which shall be headed by a Coordinator. Sets forth Office functions, including: (1) monitoring political and economic instability; (2) assessing related potential crises and responses; (3) coordinating with relevant executive agencies; (4) identifying state, local, and private sector personnel available to participate in the Response Readiness Corps or the Response Readiness Reserve; (5) international coordination and information sharing; and (6) coordinating plans for joint military-civilian operations. Authorizes the Secretary: (1) in consultation with the Administrator of USAID, to establish a Response Readiness Corps to provide stabilization and reconstruction activities in foreign countries or regions that are in, or are in transition from, conflict or civil strife (up to 250 personnel to serve in the Corps, and such other personnel as the Secretary may designate from the Department of State and USAID); and (2) in consultation with relevant executive agencies, to establish a Response Readiness Reserve of federal and at least 500 non-federal personnel to augment the Corps. Sets forth personnel provisions.</summary>
