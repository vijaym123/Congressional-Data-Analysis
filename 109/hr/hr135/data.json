Requires that such strategy: (1) respect the primary role of states in adjudicating, administering, and regulating water rights and uses; (2) identify incentives intended to ensure an adequate and dependable water supply to meet U.S. needs for the next 50 years; (3) suggest strategies that avoid increased mandates on state and local governments; (4) eliminate duplication and conflict among federal programs; (5) consider all available technologies to optimize water supply reliability, availability, and quality, while safeguarding the environment; (6) recommend means of capturing excess water and flood water for conservation and use in the event of a drought; (7) suggest financing options for comprehensive water management projects and appropriate public works projects; and (8) suggest strategies to conserve existing water supplies, including recommendations for repairing aging infrastructure. Sets forth requirements for semiannual interim reports and a final report within three years. Authorizes appropriations."
