  <summary>9/8/2005--Introduced.
Hurricane Katrina Bankruptcy Relief and Community Protection Act of 2005 - Amends federal bankruptcy law governing cases commenced as of October 17, 2005 (the effective date of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005). Excludes from the accounting of current monthly incomepayments to victims of a natural disaster on account of their status as victims of a natural disaster. Defines victim of a natural disaster as one: (1) whose financial condition is materially adversely affected by a natural disaster; and (2) whose domicile, residence, or principal place of business (including principal assets) in the United States is located in a natural disaster zone immediately preceding the event that caused the natural disaster. Permits debtor status for a debtor unable to complete credit counseling because of a natural disaster. Retains automatic stay protections for a debtor who is a victim of a natural disaster. Modifies requirements governing the statutory deadline for completion of debtor's duties. Authorizes the court to extend any such time period if: (1) the debtor is a victim of a natural disaster; and (2) the debtor's status as a victim of a natural disaster necessitates such extension of time. Includes within the permissible monthly expenses of a chapter 7 debtor the actual reasonably necessary expenses incurred as a result of being a victim of a natural disaster. Modifies requirements governing conversion or dismissal of either a Chapter 7 case, a Chapter 11 Reorganization case, or Chapter 13 case if the debtor is a victim of a natural disaster. Authorizes the court to grant an extension of time for filing small business bankruptcy documentation if the debtor is unable to meet the deadline because of a natural disaster.</summary>
