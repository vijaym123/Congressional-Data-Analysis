  <summary>4/26/2005--Introduced.
Drug Free Sports Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations requiring professional sports associations to adopt and enforce policies and procedures for testing athletes for the use of performance-enhancing substances, including regulations requiring: (1) random testing of each athlete annually without advance notification; (2) the Secretary to issue a list of substances for which each athlete is to be tested that includes prohibited substances as determined by the World Anti-Doping Agency and performance-enhancing substances for which testing is reasonable and practicable; (3) that such tests be administered by an independent party not affiliated with the professional sports associations; (4) suspension for a minimum of two years for a first positive test and permanent suspension for a second positive test; (5) disclosure to the public of the name of any athlete that tests positive; and (6) an opportunity for a prompt hearing and an appeal. Allows the Secretary to: (1) exempt any professional sports association that has previously adopted and implemented policies and procedures that meet or exceed the requirements of such regulations; and (2) fine any such association for failure to adopt and enforce testing policies and procedures consistent with the regulations. Requires the Comptroller General to study the use of performance-enhancing substances by college and secondary school athletes.</summary>
