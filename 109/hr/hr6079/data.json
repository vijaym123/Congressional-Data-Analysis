Requires the recommendations to include: (1) any proposed legislation relating to appropriate disclosure requirements for hedge funds; (2) the type of information hedge funds should disclose to regulators and to the public; (3) any efforts the hedge fund industry or regulators of financial institutions should undertake to improve practices or provide examples of successful industry initiatives; and (4) any oversight responsibilities that members of the President's Working Group should have over the hedge fund industry, and the degree and scope of such oversight."
