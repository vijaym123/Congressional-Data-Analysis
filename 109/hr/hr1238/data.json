Amends the Truth in Lending Act to prescribe guidelines governing the obligations of credit card issuers for credit extended to pay medical expenses. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prohibit a hospital or other medical treatment facility from submitting to a consumer reporting agency during a five-year period any negative information regarding the failure of a consumer to maintain full payments for medical expenses if the consumer continues in good faith to make partial payments on the outstanding balance on prescribed payment schedule due dates."
