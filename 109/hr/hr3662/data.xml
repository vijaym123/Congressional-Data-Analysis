Financial Safeguards for Hurricane Survivors Act of 2005 - Amends the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 to extend its general effective date from 180 days after date of enactment to 910 days after its date of enactment (thus extending for two additional years the time within which bankruptcy petitions may be filed under the bankruptcy law in effect before enactment of such Act). Declares this Act effective as of September 1, 2005, (thereby making victims of Hurricane Katrina eligible to file under the current bankruptcy law).</summary>
