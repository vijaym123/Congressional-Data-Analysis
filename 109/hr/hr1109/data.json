Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the rail passenger transportation security programs in Japan, member nations of the European Union (EU), and other foreign countries in order to identify effective rail transportation security measures. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to Amtrak for certain fire and life-safety improvements and infrastructure upgrades to tunnels on the Northeast Corridor. Directs the DHS Secretary to award grants directly to public transportation agencies for allowable capital and operational security improvements. Establishes a research and development (R&D) program to improve freight and intercity passenger rail security.
