Authorizes the College to expend certain funds to undertake all renovations and repairs to its infrastructure, as identified by a strategic plan approved by it and submitted to the Secretary of the Interior. Allows funds to be treated as non-Federal, private funds of the College. Authorizes appropriations to the College for: (1) operation and maintenance, to be funded by the Secretary separately from funding institutions under the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act of 1978; and (2) facilities and capital projects, to be funded through any of specified Federal agencies. Supersedes and repeals the Navajo Community College Act."
