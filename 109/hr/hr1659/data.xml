  <summary>4/14/2005--Introduced.
Navajo Nation Higher Education Act of 2004 (sic) - Authorizes the Navajo Nation's Dine College to receive all Federal funding and resources under this Act and other laws for its operation, improvement, and growth. Authorizes the College to expend certain funds to undertake all renovations and repairs to its infrastructure, as identified by a strategic plan approved by it and submitted to the Secretary of the Interior. Allows funds to be treated as non-Federal, private funds of the College. Authorizes appropriations to the College for: (1) operation and maintenance, to be funded by the Secretary separately from funding institutions under the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act of 1978; and (2) facilities and capital projects, to be funded through any of specified Federal agencies. Supersedes and repeals the Navajo Community College Act.</summary>
