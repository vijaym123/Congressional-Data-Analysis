  <summary>5/26/2005--Introduced.
Civilian Volunteer Service Reserve Act - Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish the Civilian Volunteer Service Reserve to respond to domestic or international emergencies or other circumstances determined by the President. Permits a U.S. citizen or legal resident over the age of 18 to enroll for a five-year commitment in the Reserve during which he or she shall be expected to serve in a full-time active duty status for six months. Authorizes the President to issue a voluntary call of action as an executive order to mobilize members of the Civilian Reserve to active duty status in times of emergency. Allows members of the Civilian Reserve to accept or decline a call to action except under extreme circumstances that require mandatory mobilization. Prescribes benefits and reemployment protection for members serving in full-time active duty status.</summary>
