  <summary>2/14/2006--Introduced.
Global Internet Freedom Act - Establishes in the International Broadcasting Bureau the Office of Global Internet Freedom to develop and implement a comprehensive global strategy to combat state-sponsored and state-directed Internet jamming by repressive foreign governments, and the intimidation and persecution by such governments of their citizens who use the Internet. Requires an annual report from the Office to Congress on the status of state-sponsored and state-directed Internet jamming by repressive foreign governments and a description of U.S. efforts to counter such jamming. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) denounce repressive foreign governments that engage in Internet jamming; (2) direct the U.S. Representative to the United Nations (UN) to submit a resolution condemning repressive foreign governments that engage in Internet jamming and deny their citizens the freedom to access and share information on the Internet; and (3) deploy technologies aimed at defeating state-sponsored and state-directed Internet jamming by repressive foreign governments, and the intimidation and persecution by such governments of their citizens who use the Internet.</summary>
