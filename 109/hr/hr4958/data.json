Directs the Secretary to: (1) fully coordinate the Department's canine training programs that support its counter-terrorism, counter-smuggling, transportation security, border security, and other missions; (2) ensure that the Department is maximizing its use of existing training facilities and resources to train canines throughout the year; and (3) coordinate the use of detection canines trained by other federal agencies, nonprofit organizations, universities, and private training facilities to increase the number of trained detection canines available to law enforcement agencies. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make it a priority to increase the number of domestically bred canines used by the Department to assist its counter-terrorism mission; (2) increase the utilization of domestically bred canines from universities and private and nonprofit sources; and (3) consult with other federal, state, and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, universities, and private entities that use detection canines, as well as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to encourage domestic breeding of canines and to consolidate canine procurement across the federal government. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a competitive grant program for domestic breeders of canines; and (2) establish a Homeland Security Canine Detection Accreditation Board."
