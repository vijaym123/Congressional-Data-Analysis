  <summary>2/14/2005--Introduced.
Domestic Preparedness Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to make grants to address homeland security preparedness shortcomings of units of municipal and county government. Specifies that each grant shall be made for one of the following categories: (1) equipment and training; or (2) improving interoperability between members of a consortium of municipal and county governments. Sets limitations on the Federal share of the costs of activities carried out with such grants. Mandates that an applicant be a unit of municipal or county government or a consortium of such units in order to be eligible for a grant under this Act. States that the Secretary may not make a grant under this Act unless the applicant conducts an assessment of the applicant's risk and vulnerability to possible acts of terrorism, including conventional, biological, nuclear, and chemical attacks. Provides that grant amounts: (1) shall be used only for the category of use for which the grant is made; (2) may be used only for new domestic preparedness initiatives; (3) shall not be used to sustain or supplement an existing program; and (4) may be distributed to fire departments, police departments, emergency services, and public health agencies of the grantee.</summary>
