Sets a $330 million limit for such national distribution in each of the first three months after enactment of this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax upon the sale in the United States of any crude oil, natural gas, and any fuel which is a product of crude oil or natural gas, equal to the windfall profit on such sale. Defines \"windfall profit\" as so much of the profit on such sale as exceeds a 15 percent pretax rate of return. Imposes liability for the windfall profits tax upon the seller."
