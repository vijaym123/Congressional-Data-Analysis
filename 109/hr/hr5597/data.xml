Prohibits state or local use of federal funds to assist incarceration of criminal aliens unless the state or local unit: (1) for each conviction, provides the Secretary of Homeland Security with adequate information to determine such person's immigration status; and (2) for each person determined to be unlawfully present in the United States, transfers custody of such person to the Secretary by the date imprisonment ends, or the date of sentencing if imprisonment is not imposed.</summary>
