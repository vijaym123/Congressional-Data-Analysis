  <summary>6/16/2005--Introduced.
Alien Gang Removal Act of 2005 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make an alien inadmissible for U.S. entry if: (1) such alien has been deported for criminal street gang participation; or (2) the consular officer or the Secretary of Homeland Security knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that such alien is a member of a criminal street gang seeking U.S. entry in furtherance of gang-related crimes or activities, or is a member of a designated criminal street gang. Defines: (1) criminal street gang; and (2) gang crime. Makes an alien deportable who: (1) is a street gang member convicted of committing or attempting to commit a gang crime; or (2) is determined by the Secretary to be a member of a designated criminal street gang. Authorizes the Attorney General to designate a group or association as a criminal street gang. Requires the Attorney General to provide specified congressional leaders with prior notice of, and the factual basis for, such designation. Provides for revocation of such designation by: (1) an Act of Congress; (2) the Attorney General's review based upon changed circumstances or national security; or (3) judicial appeal or petition to the Attorney General by a gang or association so designated. Requires mandatory detention of aliens subject to removal based upon criminal street gang membership. Makes such aliens ineligible for asylum and protection from removal to certain countries.</summary>
