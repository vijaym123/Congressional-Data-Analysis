    "text": "Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal criminal code to make it unlawful to: (1) destroy or interfere with vessels or maritime facilities; (2) put destructive devices in U.S. waters; (3) use a dangerous weapon or explosive to try to kill someone on board a passenger vessel; (4) fail to heave to a vessel at the direction of an authorized Federal law enforcement official; (5) destroy an aid to maritime navigation maintained by the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation or the Coast Guard if this would endanger safe navigation; or (6) knowingly discharge or release a hazardous substance into U.S. navigable waters or the adjoining shoreline with intent to endanger human life, health, or welfare. Revises piracy and privateering laws, increasing penalties. Requires the Attorney General to coordinate port-related crime data collection. Designates the Captain-of-the-Port as the primary authority for seaport security at each port. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to establish criminal penalties for violations of prohibitions against falsity or lack of a cargo manifest, and increases civil penalties. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) develop a shipment profiling plan to track containers and shipments of merchandise to be imported; (2) submit to Congress a plan for inspecting merchandise and their transportation containers at foreign facilities before importation; (3) issue final regulations prescribing seaport security requirements; and (4) approve minimum standards for high security container seals and award grants to seal developers. Requires Captains-of-the-Port to secure and protect all sensitive information."
