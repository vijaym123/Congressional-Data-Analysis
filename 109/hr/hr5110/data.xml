  <summary>12/5/2006--Passed House amended.
More Water and More Energy Act of 2006 - Amends the Water Resources Research Act of 1984 to direct the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation and the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), to identify and report to Congress on: (1) the technical, economic, environmental, legal, and other obstacles to increasing the extent to which produced water (water from an underground source that is brought to the surface as part of the process of exploration for or development of oil, natural gas, coal-bed methane, or any other substance to be used as an energy source) can be used for irrigation and other purposes; and (2) the legislative, administrative, and other actions that could reduce or eliminate such obstacles. Authorizes at least one project for the development of facilities to demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of processes to increase the extent to which produced water may be recovered and made suitable for such purposes in: (1) the Upper Basin states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming; (2) the Lower Basin states of Arizona and Nevada; and (3) California. Provides that project funds: (1) shall not exceed $1 million for any project; (2) shall not be used to pay more than 50% of the project's cost or for facility operation or maintenance; and (3) shall be in addition to other federal assistance. Directs the Secretary to: (1) review any relevant information developed in connection with research carried out by others; (2) seek the advice of individuals with relevant professional or academic expertise and of companies or individuals with industrial experience; and (3) solicit comments and suggestions from the public. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
