Authorizes at least one project for the development of facilities to demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of processes to increase the extent to which produced water may be recovered and made suitable for such purposes in: (1) the Upper Basin states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming; (2) the Lower Basin states of Arizona and Nevada; and (3) California. Provides that project funds: (1) shall not exceed $1 million for any project; (2) shall not be used to pay more than 50% of the project's cost or for facility operation or maintenance; and (3) shall be in addition to other federal assistance. Directs the Secretary to: (1) review any relevant information developed in connection with research carried out by others; (2) seek the advice of individuals with relevant professional or academic expertise and of companies or individuals with industrial experience; and (3) solicit comments and suggestions from the public. Authorizes appropriations."
