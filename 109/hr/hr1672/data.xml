  <summary>4/14/2005--Introduced.
Rights for Abducted Children Act of 2005 - Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to define: (1) "victim" to include a child victim of a family abduction; and (2) "family abduction" to mean the taking, keeping, or concealing of a child or children by a parent, other family member, or person acting on behalf of the parent or family member that prevents another individual from exercising lawful custody or visitation rights (thus making such children eligible for victim compensation and assistance). Amends the federal criminal code to include such definition of "family abduction," to modify the definition of "child abuse" to include family abduction, and to revise the definition of "child" to cover a person under age 18 who is or is alleged to be a victim of family abduction.</summary>
