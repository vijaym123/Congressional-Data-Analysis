Workplace Goods Job Growth and Competitiveness Act of 2006 - Prohibits the filing of a civil action against a manufacturer or seller of a durable good (except a motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or train that is used primarily to transport passengers for hire) more than 12 years after it was delivered to its first purchaser or lessee for: (1) damage to property allegedly caused by that good; or (2) damages for death or personal injury allegedly caused by that good if the claimant has received or is eligible to receive worker compensation and the injury does not involve a toxic harm (including, but not limited to, any asbestos-related harm). Declares that this Act: (1) shall not bar an action against a defendant who made an express warranty in writing as to the safety or life expectancy of a specific product for a period of more than 12 years (except that this Act shall apply at the expiration of such warranty); (2) does not affect the limitations period established by the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994; (3) does not supersede or modify any statute or common law that authorizes an action for civil damages, cost recovery, or any other form of relief for remediation of the environment; (4) does not affect regulatory enforcement actions brought by state or federal agencies; and (5) does not bar a civil action against a manufacturer or seller of a durable good who fraudulently concealed a defect in it.</summary>
