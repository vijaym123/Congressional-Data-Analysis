Declares that this Act: (1) shall not bar an action against a defendant who made an express warranty in writing as to the safety or life expectancy of a specific product for a period of more than 12 years (except that this Act shall apply at the expiration of such warranty); (2) does not affect the limitations period established by the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994; (3) does not supersede or modify any statute or common law that authorizes an action for civil damages, cost recovery, or any other form of relief for remediation of the environment; (4) does not affect regulatory enforcement actions brought by state or federal agencies; and (5) does not bar a civil action against a manufacturer or seller of a durable good who fraudulently concealed a defect in it."
