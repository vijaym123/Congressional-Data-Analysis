Prohibits the Director from increasing the base flood elevation in any community in areas surrounding the Great Lakes and their interconnecting channels until the Corps of Engineers completes the first updated flood level analysis. Identifies such channels as the St. Mary's River, St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River, the Niagara River, and the St. Lawrence River."
