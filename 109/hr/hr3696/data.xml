  <summary>9/8/2005--Introduced.
Medical Advertising Reform Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require prior approval by the Secretary of Health and Human Services of consumer-directed advertising for prescription drugs and restricted medical devices. Prohibits drugs advertising for a two-year period after approval of a new prescription drug. Allows the Secretary to extend such period as necessary to protect the public health. Deems prescription drugs to be misbranded for failure to comply with the advertising prohibition during such period. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to report to Congress regarding a proposal to include on the labeling and advertisements for prescription drugs information on the comparative effectiveness and comparative cost-effectiveness of a drug to other drugs in the same class. Directs the Comptroller General to study the impact of consumer-directed advertising on restricted device utilization and spending. Requires the Secretary to maintain a toll-free number to provide the public with objective information on health conditions and treatments.</summary>
