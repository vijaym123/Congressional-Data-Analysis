    "text": "Strengthen Aviation Security Act - Amends federal transportation law to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to establish a system to inspect 100% of the cargo transported on passenger aircraft operated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier in air transportation or intrastate air transportation Prescribes requirements for deployment of federal law enforcement officers not part of the Federal Air Marshall Service as alternative security personnel on commercial aircraft. Requires the Secretary to ensure the deployment of federal marshals on flights of all-cargo air transportation where sufficient risk of terrorist activity has been determined. Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to require the Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration (TSA)) to study and report to Congress on the viability of devices to enable discreet, wireless communications between flight attendants, pilots, federal air marshals, and ground-based personnel during a flight to improve coordination of planning and activities in the event of an act of terrorism. Prescribes requirements for mandatory basic security training program for flight attendants. Directs the Secretary to: (1) require aircraft engaged in cargo air transportation or intrastate air transportation to have secured cockpit doors between the cargo and pilot compartments; and (2) establish during high threat levels no-fly zones around sensitive nuclear and chemical facilities. Directs the Secretary to: (1) require airport operators to complete vulnerability assessments of airport facilities; and (2) develop a plan for addressing such vulnerabilities. Directs the Secretary to require airports serving operators of general aviation aircraft to: (1) require that all aircraft while parked at airports be secured by a visible immobilizing device; and (2) ensure that all individuals with access to such aircraft be subject to a background check. Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary to issue regulations to: (1) improve control over access to secured areas of each U.S. airport, including background checks for, and metal detector screening of, airport workers; and (2) prohibit any entity other than an airport operator from issuing a security badge to provide access to the airport's secure area. Sets forth certain whistleblower protection requirements for airport workers (including TSA employees). Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) airport screening functions should continue to be performed by federal employees; and (2) the Secretary should pursue resolution of all issues that have delayed implementation of the mandate to check passenger information against the government watchlist (no-fly list) before departures of international flights to or from the United States."
