    "text": "Fishery Management Amendments of 2006 - Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to require determinations that a fishery is depleted (currently, overfished) or approaching being depleted to be based on the best scientific information available, subject to peer review, and include an explanation of the cause or causes of the depleted condition of the fishery. Sets forth circumstances under which the rebuilding deadline may be extended for an individual stock of fish within a multispecies fishery in which more than one stock of fish is subject to a management plan, amendment, or regulation. Requires the Secretary of Commerce, with respect to a depleted fishery due to unsustainable fishing, to notify a Regional Fishery Management Council and request action be taken to end the unsustainable fishing in such fishery and to implement conservation and management measures to rebuild affected fish stocks. Provides grants for qualifying health care coverage programs to provide benefits to individuals employed in the fishing industry (including their families). Establishes the Federal Fishery Research Network to conduct research on fishery management issues. Requires federal inspection of fishing vessel safety instruction and emergency drill records. Authorizes grants for fishing vessel safety training and instruction sessions (including purchase of safety equipment). Requires a holder of an individual fishing quota to be a U.S. citizen. Provides grants to construct or improve wharves in coastal areas for commercial fishing use. Establishes the Fishery Science Education Program to increase the number of post-baccalaureate degrees in fishery science."
