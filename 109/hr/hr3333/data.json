Increases: (1) border inspectors; (2) benefits fraud inspectors; and (3) immigration and customs enforcement attorneys. Amends the Posse Comitatus Act to authorize U.S. military use for border enforcement. Suspends the visa waiver program until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies full implementation of an automated entry-exit system and the use of biometric machine readers and passports. Amends INA to establish criminal and forfeiture penalties for unlawful presence. Enhances civil and criminal penalties for document fraud and false statements of citizenship. Revises provisions respecting: (1) valid identification documents for federal benefits purposes; (2) U.S. passports; (3) Social Security cards and accounts; (4) state licenses and identification documents; (5) adjustment of status; and (6) asylum termination. Provides for federal custody of illegal aliens upon state or local request. Establishes a visa term compliance bond. Directs the Secretary to establish a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office of Investigations in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Renames the employment authorization verification pilot program as the EASI Check system, and makes such program mandatory and permanent. Sets forth program provisions. Increases employer penalties for hiring, recruiting, or referral violations, including permanent ineligibility to petition for H-visa workers. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) provide for individual taxpayer identification number (TIN) sharing between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); (2) restrict tax credit eligibility for persons using a TIN rather than a social security number; and (3) provide maximum penalties for certain noncomplying employers. Declares that states and localities have the inherent authority to arrest, detain, or transfer aliens in the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. Requires Cameron University, Lawton, Oklahoma, to establish an immigration training demonstration project for state, local and tribal law enforcement officers. Amends the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to: (1) revise funding provisions for federal reimbursement of emergency health services furnished to undocumented aliens; (2) require an eligible health care provider in order to be paid for services to obtain and forward to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) an alien's citizenship information; and (3) eliminate coverage for Mexicans with border crossing cards."
