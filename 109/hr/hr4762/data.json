Applies this Act to a convicted individual upon his or her unconditional release from incarceration and completion of his or her sentence, including parole. Provides for enforcement of, and remedies for, violations of this Act. Prohibits construing this Act to prohibit states from affording the right to vote in any federal election on less restrictive terms."
