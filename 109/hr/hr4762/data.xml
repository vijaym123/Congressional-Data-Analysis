  <summary>2/15/2006--Introduced.
Second Chance Voting Rights Act of 2006 - Declares that the right of a U.S. citizen to vote in any election for federal office shall not be denied or abridged because that individual has been convicted of a criminal offense. Applies this Act to a convicted individual upon his or her unconditional release from incarceration and completion of his or her sentence, including parole. Provides for enforcement of, and remedies for, violations of this Act. Prohibits construing this Act to prohibit states from affording the right to vote in any federal election on less restrictive terms.</summary>
