  <summary>5/11/2005--Introduced.
Public Safety Act - Prohibits funds provided by the federal government to a state or local government for the purpose of providing core correctional services from being used to contract with private contractors or vendors to provide such activities. Defines "core correctional services" as the housing, safeguarding, protecting, and disciplining of persons charged or convicted of an offense. Amends the federal criminal code to require the Bureau of Prisons to provide that: (1) any penal or correctional facility or institution, except a facility for nonprofit community correctional confinement (such as halfway houses), confining any person convicted of offenses against the United States shall be under the direction of the Director of the Bureau and shall be managed and maintained by federal, state, or local government employees; and (2) the housing, safeguarding, protection, and disciplining of any person charged with or convicted of any offense against the United States (with that exception) shall be conducted and carried out by federal, state, or local government employees.</summary>
