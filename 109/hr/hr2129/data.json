Reauthorizes appropriations under: (1) the Food Security Act of 1985 for the Great Lakes basin program for soil erosion and sediment control; (2) the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain Act of 2002 for research and development; and (3) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for the Great Lakes National Program Office. Directs such Office and the Great Lakes Research Office to submit the joint research plan to the Executive Committee of the Regional Collaboration. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) the Great Lakes Coordination Office; (2) research on fisheries and ecosystems in the Lower Great Lakes; and (3) the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, for use by the Great Lakes Science Center. Reauthorizes national programs for the prevention, reduction, and elimination of pollution and authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in carrying out such programs, to provide technical assistance to rural and small municipalities to help in planning, developing, and acquiring financing for wastewater infrastructure assistance. Extends the payment period for water pollution control revolving loan funds. Authorizes a State to provide additional subsidization to benefit a municipality that meets specified requirements. Codifies: (1) the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force within EPA (as originally established by Executive Order 13340); and (2) the Framework for the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration."
