    "text": "Digital Television Consumer Education Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require manufacturers of television receiving equipment (TVs) that does not include a digital tuner to: (1) place an advisory label on its screen stating that, after February 17, 2009, such TV will receive TV signals only by using additional equipment; and (2) place such label permanently and conspicuously on the outside of the TV packaging. Provides related advisory requirements for retail distributors and other vendors. Requires broadcaster public service announcements about the deadline for termination of analog TV broadcasting and the equipment options for consumers following such termination. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to create a DTV Transition Federal Advisory Committee to educate the public about the digital television transition. Requires such education to commence by September 1, 2007."
