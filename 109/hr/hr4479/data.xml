  <summary>12/8/2005--Introduced.
Energy Consumer Relief Act of 2005 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal oil and gas tax subsidies including: (1) the election to expense certain refineries; (2) treatment of natural gas distribution lines as 15-year property; (3) treatment of natural gas gathering lines as 7-year property; (4) the new rule for determining small refiner exception to oil depletion deduction; and (5) amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures. Repeals certain oil and gas production incentives, including those with respect to: (1) royalty relief for deep water production; (2) the Alaska offshore royalty suspension; (3) oil and gas leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska; (4) management of federal oil and gas leasing programs; (5) oil and gas research programs); and (6) ultra-deepwater and unconventional natural gas and other petroleum resources. Instructs the President to suspend royalty relief for production of crude oil or natural gas from federal lands during periods in which the average price has risen over specified amounts. Requires that specified increased revenues received in the Treasury as the result of the enactment of this Act be made directly available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for obligation and expenditure under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a refundable tax credit for energy cost assistance for farmers and ranchers. Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to establish an Energy Emergency Grant Program to make grants to small business concerns that have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of a significant increase in the price of heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, transportation fuel, propane, or kerosene.</summary>
