  <summary>9/14/2005--Introduced.
Protecting Our Children from Sexual Predators Act of 2005 - Requires a state actor (any state, the District of Columbia, or specified U.S. territories and possessions) or federally recognized Indian tribe (tribal actor) that issues driver's licenses or identification cards to have in effect throughout the jurisdiction laws and policies that ensure that: (1) the actor does not issue or renew a driver's license, commercial driver's license, or identification card to a sex offender (offender) without satisfactory evidence that the offender is in compliance with all applicable offender registration requirements; and (2) such license or card expires on the first anniversary date of the offender's birthday, measured from the birthday nearest the date of issuance. Grants each actor two years to implement this Act. Directs the Attorney General to coordinate with the Secretary of the Interior to assist tribal actors in implementing this Act. Provides that for any fiscal year after the expiration of that period a state or tribal actor that fails to fully implement this Act shall not receive 10% of the funds that would otherwise be allocated under the Byrne, Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants program and any other program under which the Attorney General provides grants or financial assistance.</summary>
