  <summary>4/5/2006--Introduced.
Declares that: (1) funding for English language learners provided by Arizona's 47th Legislature's Second Legislative Session is adequate; and (2) any failure of Arizona (or by any agency or subdivision of Arizona) to provide funding in excess of that amount is not a denial of equal educational opportunity under the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, and is not a basis for a civil action, or for relief, against Arizona (or any agency or subdivision). Makes this Act applicable to litigation pending upon its enactment, including Flores v. Arizona.</summary>
