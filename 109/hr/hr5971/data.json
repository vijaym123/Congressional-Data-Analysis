Includes among the guarantee requirements that: (1) the purpose of the guarantee is to help a small business acquire capital for the purchase of materials relating to health information technology; and (2) purchase of materials is made pursuant to a plan certified by the Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology. Requires the SBA Inspector General to review periodically a representative sample of such guaranteed loans in order to mitigate fraud and to ensure the safety and soundness of the program."
