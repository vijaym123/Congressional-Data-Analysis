  <summary>5/25/2006--Introduced.
Federal Contract Accountability Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to debar an employer of unlawful aliens from federal contract, grant, or cooperative agreement eligibility for two years. Provides for discretionary waiver or limited duration of debarment. States that any entity, including a state or local government, carrying out a project for which a federal share of funding is provided may not receive the federal share, or shall be required to return such share to the federal government, if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the entity is in violation of unlawful employment of alien provisions.</summary>
