Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow individual taxpayers a tax credit for the cost of COBRA continuation coverage; (2) provide for advance payments of such credit to cover current COBRA continuation coverage premiums; and (3) increase tax rates for individuals with adjusted gross incomes over $500,000 ($1 million for married taxpayers filing joint tax returns)."
