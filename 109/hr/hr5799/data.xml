Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, if the State of Florida notifies the Secretary that encroachments by improvements or occupation have occurred before July 13, 2006, on one or more of the parcels of real property described in this Act, to release to Florida any reversionary interest of the United States in and to any identified parcel without further federal administrative review or analysis. Bars the United States from receiving any funds as consideration for the release of the reversionary interests specified above. Requires all net proceeds from the disposition of such real property to be used by the State for the acquisition of other lands adjacent to the exterior boundaries of Blackwater River State Forest and Withlacoochee State Forest. Requires: (1) any lands so acquired to become a part of the state forest; and (2) that the acquired lands be used for public purposes. Requires the State to agree to indemnify and hold the United States harmless with regard to any boundary disputes related to any parcel released under this Act.</summary>
