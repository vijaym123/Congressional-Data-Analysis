  <summary>5/2/2006--Introduced.
Amends part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to: (1) extend the 2006 and 2007 initial enrollment periods for the Medicare prescription drug benefit; (2) suspend the late enrollment penalty through December 31, 2007; and (3) permit Medicare beneficiaries to change enrollment in a prescription drug plan during the first 12 months of enrollment. Prohibits a PDP sponsor, beginning with 2006, from removing a covered part D drug from the plan formulary, or imposing a restriction or limitation on the coverage of such a drug, other than at the beginning of each plan year, except as the Secretary may permit to take into account new therapeutic uses and newly covered part D drugs. Requires each PDP sponsor to furnish to each plan enrollee, at the time of each annual coordinated election period, a notice of any changes in the formulary or other part D drug coverage restrictions or limitations that will take effect for the upcoming plan year.</summary>
