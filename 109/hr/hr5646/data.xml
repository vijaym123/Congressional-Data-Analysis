  <summary>12/20/2006--Public Law.
Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), through the Energy Star program, to analyze and report to Congress on the growth and energy consumption of computer data centers by the federal government and private enterprise. Requires such study to include: (1) growth trends associated with data centers and the utilization of servers in the federal government and private sector; (2) analysis of the industry migration to the use of energy efficient microchips and servers designed to provide energy efficient computing and reduce the costs associated with large and medium scale data centers; (3) analysis of the potential cost savings available through the adoption of energy efficient data centers and servers; (4) analysis of the potential impacts of energy efficiency on product performance; (5) analysis of the potential cost savings and benefits to the energy supply chain through the use of stationary fuel cells for backup power and distributed generation; (6) an overview of current government incentives offered for energy efficient products and services; (7) recommendations for incentives and voluntary programs to encourage the use of energy efficient data centers and computing; and (8) an opportunity for stakeholders to comment and provide information on the study. Expresses the sense of Congress that it is in the United States' best interest for purchasers of computer servers to give high priority to energy efficiency as a factor in determining best value and performance for purchases of servers.</summary>
