Cites conditions which exempt national security and law enforcement agencies from this Act. Prescribes guidelines for coordinated notification of database security breaches with credit reporting agencies. Grants the Federal Trade Commission enforcement powers, including the assessment of civil fines. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require a consumer reporting agency to place an extended fraud alert into a consumer file when a consumer submits evidence of notification that personal financial information has or may have been compromised. Empowers State Attorneys General to enforce this Act. Preempts state or local law inconsistent with this Act."
