Directs the Secretary concerned to: (1) require preseparation counseling for members (including officers) of reserve components being separated from service on active duty for more than 30 days; and (2) ensure that commanders authorize such members to obtain counseling during duty time. Requires preseparation counseling on: (1) certification and licensure requirements for civilian occupations; (2) civilian occupations that correspond to military occupational specialties; and (3) Government employment. Enlarges the scope of counseling topics. Extends preseparation counseling to members of the National Guard being separated from long-term duty. States that counseling locations shall include: (1) military installations; (2) armories and military family support centers of the National Guard; (3) Armed Forces inpatient medical care facilities; and (4) locations reasonably convenient for members on the temporary disability retired list. Directs the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to require participation in the Department of Labor transitional services program unless members previously participated in the program or are returning to previously held employment or educational pursuits. Enlarges the scope of the Department of Labor transitional services program. Makes members of the reserve components being separated from service on active duty for a period of more than 30 days and members of the National Guard being separated from full-time National Guard duty eligible for such program.</summary>
