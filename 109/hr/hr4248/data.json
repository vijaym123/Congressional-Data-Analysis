    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose upon integrated oil companies an excise tax of 50 percent of their net windfall profit from the production of taxable crude oil in a taxable year. Defines \"windfall profit\" as the excess of the removal price (sales price) of a barrel of taxable crude oil over the adjusted base price of such barrel (i.e., $40 per barrel, adjusted for inflation). Terminates such tax three years after the enactment of this Act. Allows a tax deduction for the payment of any windfall profit tax. Appropriates windfall profit tax revenues generated by this Act for the sole purpose of carrying out the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981."
