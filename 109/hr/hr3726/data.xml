Child Pornography Prevention Act of 2005 - Amends federal criminal code provisions regarding the sexual exploitation of children to: (1) prohibit producers of visual depictions of sexually explicit conduct from refusing to permit the Attorney General to inspect records at business premises; and (2) modify the definition of "produces" to include actually filming, videotaping, photographing, or digitally manipulating an image of an actual human being that contains a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct. Requires, in any criminal proceeding: (1) any material that constitutes child pornography to remain in the care, custody, and control of either the government or the court; and (2) a court to deny any request by the defendant to reproduce material that constitutes child pornography, provided the government makes the material reasonably available to the defendant. Makes specified provisions of the Controlled Substances Act applicable to the criminal forfeiture of obscene property. Authorizes criminal and civil asset forfeiture in specified child exploitation and obscenity cases, such as cases involving: (1) the use of interstate facilities to transmit information about a minor with intent to solicit sexual activity; and (2) the use of misleading domain names on the Internet with intent to deceive a person into viewing obscene material. Makes the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act applicable to activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors. Authorizes administrative subpoenas for investigations of federal offenses involving the distribution of obscenity. Prohibits the production of obscene matter.</summary>
