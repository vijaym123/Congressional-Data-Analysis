Bars the Bureau from editing or erasing any such recording. Directs the Bureau to make available a digital video disc that contains a copy of the recording: (1) at the request of a person who claims an ownership interest in such item; and (2) to a defendant in a criminal proceeding involving such item. Provides that an item which the Bureau has determined is a firearm or ammunition shall not be admissible as evidence unless: (1) the Bureau has complied with such requirement; or (2) such compliance has been waived in writing by the person against whom the item is offered as evidence."
