    "text": "Accelerating the Creation of Teachers of Influence for Our Nation Act - Directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a program providing competitive scholarships to undergraduate students who study science, engineering, or mathematics and earn their elementary or secondary teaching certificate. Requires such students to serve as elementary or secondary school science or mathematics teachers for five years, if they have received at least three years of assistance, and three years, if the assistance was of shorter duration. Subtracts one year from such service requirements if the student teaches at a school serving a high proportion of disadvantaged students. Allows students who have received at least one year of assistance to apply for up to two years of additional assistance in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics Master's degree program. Increases the teaching service obligation by one year for each additional year of assistance. Establishes a government trust fund for donations to the NSF scholarship program. Requires the NSF Director to establish a program awarding competitive annual $1 million grants to institutions of higher education for the development and implementation of programs providing: (1) undergraduate science, mathematics, and engineering degrees; (2) elementary or secondary teacher certification; and (3) professional development and mentoring activities. Requires recipients to kick in an additional $200,000 for the grants. Includes within a list of factors winning preference for applicants, proposals to: (1) provide students with summer internships with researchers in their field; and (2) enter into partnerships with private sector entities and other institutions of higher education."
