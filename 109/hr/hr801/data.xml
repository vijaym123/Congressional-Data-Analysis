  <summary>2/15/2005--Introduced.
Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention Act of 2005 - Amends Title XVIII (Medicare) and Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to expand Medicare and Medicaid coverage to include remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy (a diagnostic examination that is provided no more than annually to an individual who has been diagnosed with diabetes, that meets technical standards set forth by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that is furnished via a telecommunications system to an eligible patient, and that is conducted under the supervision of a board-certified ophthalmologist with retinal fellowship training). Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the costs incurred by health care providers to provide such assessment. Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary to: (1) establish the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program to make five grants to eligible entities to establish mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs; (2) give priority to entities with relevant experience who propose to serve rural, impoverished, unserved, minority, and remote populations; and (3) convene an advisory committee to evaluate the Program.</summary>
