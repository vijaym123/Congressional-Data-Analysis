  <summary>2/8/2005--Introduced.
Ex-Offenders Voting Rights Act of 2005 - Declares that the right of a U.S. citizen to vote in any election for Federal office shall not be denied or abridged because that individual has been convicted of a criminal offense unless, at the time of the election, such individual: (1) is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility; or (2) is on parole or probation for a felony offense. Provides for enforcement and remedies for violations of this Act. Specifies that: (1) nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a State from enacting any State law that affords the right to vote in any election for Federal office on terms less restrictive than those terms established by this Act; and (2) the rights and remedies established by this Act shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law, and shall not supersede, restrict, or limit the application of the Voters Rights Act of 1965 or the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.</summary>
