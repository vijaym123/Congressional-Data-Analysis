Directs the Secretary to: (1) require that such technologies be used exclusively to authenticate the pedigree of prescription drugs; and (2) prohibit such technologies from containing or transmitting any identifying information of a health care practitioner or consumer, or any advertisement or information about indications or off-label uses. Requires the Secretary to encourage prescription drug manufacturers and distributors to incorporate: (1) overt optically variable counterfeit-resistant technologies into packaging; and (2) required prescription drug packaging technologies into multiple elements of the physical packaging of the drugs. Requires prescription drug shipments to include a label on the shipping container that incorporates packaging technologies. Deems a prescription drug to be misbranded if the packaging or labeling of the drug is in violation of a requirement or prohibition of this Act. Requires the Secretary to publish the National Specified List of Susceptible Prescription Drugs, consisting of not less than 30 of the most frequently counterfeited prescription drugs in the United States."
