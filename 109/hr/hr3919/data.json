Directs such Secretaries to provide owners and operators of such facilities on such lands with the option to develop and submit an integrated vegetation management plan for approval. Outlines a plan review, approval, and implementation process. Allows such owners and operators to conduct vegetation management activities to meet facilities' clearance requirements. Provides a liability waiver when the appropriate Secretary fails to allow such owners and operators to manage vegetation within a right-of-way or easement on such lands, with an exception in the case of contributory negligence. Encourages such Secretaries to develop a program to train appropriate federal personnel involved in vegetation management decisions relating to such facilities."
