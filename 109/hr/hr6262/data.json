Carey Public Safety Officer Benefits Enhancement Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to extend: (1) educational benefits to public safety officers who become permanently and totally disabled in the line of duty and to their spouses and children; (2) allow payment of retroactive benefits to dependents of such disabled officers; and (3) establish a program of pension payments for certain survivors of deceased public safety officers. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to: (1) award a Public Safety Officer scholarship to disabled public safety officers, their spouses, and their children; and (2) enter into agreements with educational institutions to carry out such scholarship program. Amends federal personnel law to allow widows or widowers of federal employees killed on the job to continue to receive monthly compensation even if they remarry before reaching age 55."
