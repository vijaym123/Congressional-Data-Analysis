Imposes a similar bar on denials of discretionary relief and orders against criminal aliens with an exception for petitions for review concerning constitutional claims or pure questions of law. Establishes the INA's judicial review provisions as the sole avenue for challenging removal orders and reviewing claims arising under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment."
