  <summary>7/19/2006--Introduced.
Teacher Centers Act of 2006 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) or consortiums of LEAs for the establishment and operation of new teacher centers or the support of existing centers. Requires that special consideration be given to high-need LEAs that serve a specified number or percentage of poor children and face difficulties in recruiting highly qualified teachers. Requires teacher centers established or supported with such funds to provide: (1) high-quality professional development to teachers that will enable them to help students improve their achievement and meet state academic standards; (2) teachers with information on developments in curricula, assessments, and educational research; and (3) training and support for new teachers. Lists other permissible uses of such funds by teacher centers. Conditions a center's receipt of such assistance on its operation under the supervision of a teacher center policy board, the majority of whose members must be representatives of, and selected by, the elementary and secondary school teachers to be served by the center.</summary>
