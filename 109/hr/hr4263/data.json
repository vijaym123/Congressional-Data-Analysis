Defines \"windfall profit\" as the excess of the removal price (sales price) of a barrel of taxable crude oil over the adjusted base price of such barrel (i.e., $40 per barrel, adjusted for inflation). Terminates such tax three years after the enactment of this Act. Establishes in the Treasury the Consumer Energy Assistance Trust Fund. Transfers to such Fund windfall profit tax revenues and makes amounts in such Fund available to carry out the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. Grants to taxpayers an income tax rebate in an amount to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based upon the number of taxpayers and available windfall profit tax revenues (reduced by amounts appropriated to such Fund)."
