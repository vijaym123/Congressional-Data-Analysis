  <summary>5/11/2006--Introduced.
Hurricane Relief Extension Act of 2006 - Amends the Hurricane Education Recovery Act to allow the Secretary of Education to extend, beyond the 2006 school year, the period during which a state educational agency or local educational agency may obligate temporary emergency impact aid for elementary and secondary schools that enroll students displaced by Hurricane Katrina or Rita; though such funds may still be used only for expenses incurred during the 2005-2006 school year. Urges state educational agencies to distribute expeditiously any education relief funds received under such Act to impacted schools and institutions.</summary>
