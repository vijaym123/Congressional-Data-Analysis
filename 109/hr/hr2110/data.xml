  <summary>9/27/2006--Passed House amended.
Colorado Northern Front Range Mountain Backdrop Protection Study Act - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, to review the lands within the study area (certain lands in or adjacent to the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests in southern Boulder, northern Jefferson, and northern Gilpin Counties, Colorado) and report to specified officials and to Congress on: (1) the present ownership of such lands; (2) which undeveloped land may be at risk of development; and (3) actions that could be taken by the United States, Colorado, a political subdivision, or any other parties to preserve the open and undeveloped character of such lands. Requires the Secretary, in implementing this Act, to consult with the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, the Colorado State Forest Service, the Colorado State Conservation Board, Great Outdoors Colorado, and the Boards of County Commissioners of Boulder, Jefferson, and Gilpin Counties, Colorado. Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to take any action that would affect the use of any lands not owned by the United States.</summary>
