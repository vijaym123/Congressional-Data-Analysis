Terminates the loan authority at the end of 2008. Directs the Administrator to make grants to small business development centers to enable such centers to provide to veterans a program of assistance that includes training in a vocational or technical trade and entrepreneurial assistance in establishing and operating a small business that provides services in such trade.
