Amends the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 to permit longer terms for agreements and contracts for stewardship contracting projects in Colorado. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to expand the Fuels for Schools program to include Colorado. Authorizes such Secretary to make grants in a specified amount each fiscal year to carry out such program in Colorado. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend the placed in service date for the renewable electricity production credit for electricity produced by facilities using open-loop biomass to January 1, 2010. Makes electricity produced and sold from such facilities eligible for the full credit rate."
