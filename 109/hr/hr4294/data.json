States that such an agreement shall provide clear and direct benefits to park natural resources and shall provide for: (1) the preservation, conservation, and restoration of coastal and riparian systems, watersheds, and wetlands; (2) preventing, controlling, or eradicating invasive exotic species that are within a unit of the National Park System or adjacent to such a unit; or (3) restoration of natural resources, including native wildlife habitat or ecosystems. Bars the Secretary from using any funds associated with such an agreement for the purposes of land acquisition, regulatory activity, or the development, maintenance, or operation of infrastructure, except for ancillary support facilities that the Secretary determines to be necessary for the completion of projects or activities identified in the agreement. Provides that, funds available to carry out the provisions of this Act shall be limited to programs and amounts specified in the statute for such use in the annual appropriations Act for the National Park Service."
