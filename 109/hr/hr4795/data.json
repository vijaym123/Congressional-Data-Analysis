Requires accrediting agencies and associations to provide educational institutions with: (1) written notice of deficiencies and a reasonable time period to correct such deficiencies; (2) advance notice of any adverse action and an opportunity for a hearing; and (3) a right to appeal an adverse action to an independent and impartial arbitration panel. Requires accrediting agencies and associations to: (1) ensure consistent application of accreditation standards to an educational institution's governing board in receivership; and (2) allow public access to meetings involving accreditation recommendations. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to issue regulations to further define due process requirements for the accreditation process."
