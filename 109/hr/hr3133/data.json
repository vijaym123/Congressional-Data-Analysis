    "text": "Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act - Requires each: (1) jurisdiction to maintain a sex offender registry; and (2) sex offender to register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, is an employee, and is a student. Directs the offender and the jurisdiction to provide specified information for inclusion in the registry. Sets forth requirements regarding duration of the registration requirement. Penalizes jurisdictions for failure to comply with this Act. Establishes: (1) the Jessica Lunsford Address Verification Program; (2) the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website; and (3) the Megan Nicole Kanka and Alexandra Nicole Zapp Community Program. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) maintain a National Sex Offender Registry at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (2) develop and support related software; (3) establish and implement a Sex Offender Management Assistance program; (4) carry out a demonstration project of grants to jurisdictions using electronic monitoring devices; (5) ensure that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has access to the Interstate Identification Index; and (6) assist jurisdictions in locating and apprehending offenders who violate registration requirements. Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) set penalties for failure to register; and (2) prohibit the use of a controlled substance to substantially impair the ability of a person to appraise or control conduct in order to commit a sex offense. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize grants to assist states in enforcing registration requirements."
