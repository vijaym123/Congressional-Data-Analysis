Requires each such increase to be the same percentage as the increase in benefits provided under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, on the same effective date. Codifies under veterans' disability compensation provisions the increases to such compensation provided under the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2004. Directs the Secretary to conduct a two-year demonstration project for the improvement of business practices of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Requires: (1) the Secretary to enter into a performance-based contract for a contractor to carry out the demonstration project; (2) such project to be conducted at two VHA facilities having a relatively low performance in the recovery or collection of indebtedness from third-party payers for the provision of veterans' medical care; (3) a VHA employee to be designated as the full-time project manager; (4) the Secretary to submit interim reports and a final report to Congress on project operations; and (5) the Comptroller General to review the project and report review results to Congress. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to designate, establish, and operate at selected Department of Veterans Affairs health-care facilities six centers for Parkinson's disease research, education, and clinical activities. Requires the Under Secretary for Health to establish a panel to assess the scientific and clinical merit of proposals submitted by a facility for the operation of such a center. Authorizes appropriations."
