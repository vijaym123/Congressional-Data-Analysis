  <summary>7/28/2006--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Defense to pay compensation as prescribed under this Act to those living members of the Armed Forces and U.S. civilian employees who were captured by Japan, who were used as slave labor during World War II, and whose application for compensation is approved. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to accept any monetary contribution (with exceptions) made by any person upon on the condition that the contribution be used to provide such compensation to a selected veteran or civilian internee. Requires amounts received as contributions to be deposited in the Department of Defense General Gift Fund. States that, any amount paid to a selected veteran or civilian internee as compensation under this Act is in addition to any other amount paid to such veteran or civilian internee under any other provision of law as compensation for the performance of slave labor during World War II. Expresses the sense of Congress regarding contributions by certain Japanese corporations.</summary>
