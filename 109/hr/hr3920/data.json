Requires a state to certify that at least 5% of grant funds shall be allocated for specialized domestic violence courts. Amends the State Justice Institute Act of 1984 to allow funds available pursuant to grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts awarded under the Act to be used to: (1) implement and evaluate court-based approaches to adjudicating domestic violence cases in state courts; and (2) provide technical assistance to state courts to facilitate the development and adoption of improved practices in such adjudication."
