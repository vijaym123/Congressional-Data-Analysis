Steve Grissom Relief Fund Act of 2005 - Establishes the Steve Grissom Relief Fund in the Treasury. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a single payment from the Fund to any individual infected with HIV or diagnosed with AIDS who: (1) was treated with HIV-contaminated blood, blood components, human tissue, or organs; (2) is the lawful spouse of an individual so treated; (3) is a former spouse of such an individual and can assert reasonable certainty of transmission of HIV from such individual; and (4) acquired HIV through perinatal transmission from such an individual or individual's spouse. Sets forth documentation, petition, determination, and payment procedures. States that such payments do not create or admit any claim, but do constitute full satisfaction of all claims by or on behalf of such an individual. Provides that such payments do not constitute income for tax, benefits, or other purposes. Prohibits the assignment or transfer of rights under this Act. Limits petitions to one per victim. Terminates the program after five years. Excludes payments from consideration as: (1) compensation or reimbursement in determining repayment for insurance or worker's compensation benefits; or (2) income or resources in determining eligibility for social security income benefits.</summary>
