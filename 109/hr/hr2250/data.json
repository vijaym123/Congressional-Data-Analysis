    "text": "Valuing Our Trust in Elections Act - Directs the Attorney General, within 30 days after receiving a complaint or other allegation, backed by evidence, of a violation of any Federal criminal law regarding voter intimidation, election fraud, or any provision relating to a Federal election, to initiate an investigation, and report to the chief election official of the State involved every 60 days until the investigation is completed. Amends the Help America Vote Act to require: (1) each State to establish standards for the distribution of voter registration application forms for Federal elections; and (2) the Election Assistance Commission to establish standards for the prevention of fraud and abuse in the handling of absentee ballots in such elections. Requires each State to distribute, collect, and process absentee ballots in Federal elections in accordance with such standards. Provides for appropriate penalties for enforcement. Requires individuals who register to vote and voters who vote in person, unless exempted by State law in certain circumstances, to provide a current, valid government-issued photo identification. Directs the Commission to make payments to eligible States for assisting individuals with covering the costs of obtaining the government-issued photo identification an individual must present or provide in order to receive a Federal election ballot. Requires certain training programs for poll workers."
