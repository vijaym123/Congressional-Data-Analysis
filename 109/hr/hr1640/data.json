    "text": "Energy Policy Act of 2005 - Sets forth an energy research and development program, including: (1) energy efficiency; (2) renewable energy; (3) oil and gas; (4) coal; (5) Indian energy; (6) nuclear matters and security; (7) vehicles and motor fuels, including ethanol; (8) hydrogen; (9) electricity; and (10) energy tax incentives. Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to: (1) institute grant programs for low-income community energy efficiency and energy efficient public buildings; and (2) revise energy conservation standards for additional consumer products. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to prescribe incentive payments for renewable energy production facilities. Amends the Federal Power Act to prescribe guidelines for hydroelectric licensing proposals for alternative conditions and requirements governing project works within a federal reservation. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to make incentive payments to promote hydroelectric production. Amends the Natural Gas Act with respect to: (1) construction, expansion, or operation of liquefaction or gasification natural gas terminals; and (2) natural gas market transparency. Prescribes procedural guidelines for the Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding regarding oil and gas leasing on federal lands. United States Refinery Revitalization Act of 2005 - Prescribes procedural guidelines for: (1) designation of refinery revitalization zones; and (2) coordination and expeditious review of permitting process for such zones. Sets forth a Clean Coal Power Initiative campaign that includes grants to universities to establish Centers of Excellence for Energy Systems of the Future. Authorizes federal loan guarantees for designated coal gasification projects. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to prescribe implementation guidelines for a clean air coal program. Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act of 2005 - Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to establish the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs to promote Indian tribal energy resource development through grants and loans. Prescribes guidelines for energy efficiency in federally assisted housing on Indian lands. Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to modify and extend indemnification authority and liability limits for Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees and Department of Energy (DOE) contractors. Prohibits assumption by the U.S. Government of liability for certain foreign incidents. Directs the NRC to establish a training and fellowship program for individuals with critical nuclear safety regulatory skills. Revises requirements for: (1) uranium sales; (2) special demonstration projects for the uranium mining industry; (3) whistleblower protection requirements; (4) medical isotope production; (5) uranium enrichment facilities; and (6) the national uranium stockpile. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to establish an Advanced Reactor Hydrogen Co-Generation Project. Provides for disposal of: (1) Fernald uranium processing facility byproduct material; and (2) greater-than-class C radioactive waste. Establishes programs to promote: (1) hybrid vehicles; (2) hybrid retrofit and electric conversion technologies for combustion engine vehicles; and (3) alternative fuels for dual-fueled vehicles. Sets forth implementation guidelines for pilot programs that target: (1) alternative fueled vehicles; (2) fuel cell buses and alternative fuel and altra-low sulfur diesel fuel (clean) school buses; (3) advanced vehicles; and (4) hybrid vehicles. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to conduct programs that address: (1) production of hydrogen from diverse energy sources; and (2) solar and wind technologies. Directs the Secretary to conduct: (1) a secondary electric vehicle battery use program; and (2) a Next Generation Lighting Initiative. Directs the Secretary of Energy to implement initiatives regarding: (1) energy efficiency; (2) distributed energy and electric energy systems; (3) renewable energy; (4) nuclear energy; (5) fossil energy; (6) ultra-deepwater and unconventional natural gas, and other petroleum resources; (7) energy sciences; (8) energy and environment; (9) United States-Israel cooperation; and (10) Department of Energy management. Electric Reliability Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal Power Act to grant Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulatory jurisdiction over an Electric Reliability Organization. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to: (1) require electric utilities to make net metering and smart metering available upon consumer request; and (2) terminate mandatory purchase and sale requirements pertaining to cogeneration and small power production utilities. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 - Repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Amends the Federal Power Act to: (1) direct FERC to promulgate market transparency rules governing wholesale electric energy and transmission services; and (2) prohibit round trip trading. Authorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue rules that prohibit in the absence of consumer consent: (1) the change of selection of an electric utility (\"slamming\"); and (2) the sale of goods and services to an electric consumer (\"cramming\"). Revises Federal Power Act requirements for electric utility mergers. Directs FERC to convene a joint board to study the issue of security constrained economic dispatch for a market region. Retains the effect of Department of Energy Order No. 202-03-2 (August 28, 2003) regarding transmission security. Extends the attainment date for certain downwind ozone nonattainment areas. Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (Administrator) to promulgate regulations ensuring that domestic motor vehicle fuel consumption includes renewable fuel containing ethanol. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to make grants to provide assistance to merchant producers of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in making the transition from producing MTBE to producing iso-octane, iso-octene, alkylates, or renewable fuels. Prohibits the use of MTBE in motor vehicle fuel by December 31, 2014, in any state that does not specifically authorize it. Authorizes the President to determine by June 30, 2014, that this prohibition against the use of MTBE in motor vehicle fuel shall not take place and that the legal authority to prohibit its use in motor vehicle fuel shall become null and void. Eliminates the oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline. Conditions the Administrator's approval of state fuel restrictions upon a finding that they will neither cause fuel supply or distribution interruptions nor have a significant adverse impact on fuel producibility. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to: (1) make loan guarantees for private sector construction of facilities for the processing and conversion of municipal solid waste and cellulosic biomass into fuel ethanol and other commercial byproducts; and (2) provide grants for construction of ethanol production facilities. Underground Storage Tank Compliance Act of 2005 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Administrator to distribute specified fund percentages from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund to states to pay costs for regulation of underground storage tanks (USTs). Amends the Clean Air Act to cite conditions under which the Administrator may waive the prohibition against the use of extreme and unusual fuel or fuel additive supplies (\"boutique fuels\")."
