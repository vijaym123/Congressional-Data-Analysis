Directs that such campaign include dissemination of effective prevention practices and techniques to parents, care givers, maternity hospitals, child care centers, organizations providing prenatal and postnatal care, and organizations providing parenting education and support services. Requires the Secretary to establish biannual meetings with Shaken Baby Syndrome advocacy groups, parenting support communities, organizations involved in child protection and child maltreatment prevention, and other federal and state agencies involved in prevention activities. Directs the Secretary and such entities to provide support for the parents of surviving children who suffer serious brain injuries as the result of shaking."
