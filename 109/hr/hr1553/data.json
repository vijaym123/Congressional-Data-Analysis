Prohibits U.S. military assistance to Pakistan until the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that: (1) the Government of Pakistan has provided the United States with unrestricted opportunities to interview Dr. Khan, and has complied with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requests regarding such network; and (2) the U.S. Government has determined such network's full scope of activities and participants, determined the nature of its connection to al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, and, in conjunction with the IAEA, has confirmed its dismantling."
