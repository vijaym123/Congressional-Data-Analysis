  <summary>5/23/2005--Introduced.
Requires a state or local law enforcement agency, upon accepting federal funds, to issue guidelines under which: (1) each warrant for the arrest of a nonviolent offender is executed by that agency only during a time when, and at a location where, the agency reasonably believes no children are present or in other circumstances if a court first determines that overriding reasons, in furtherance of the interests of children, exist (such as the interest in apprehending individuals who engage in drug offenses with children or on school grounds); and (2) relevant counseling is made available to each child who witnesses the execution of an arrest warrant under such circumstances.</summary>
