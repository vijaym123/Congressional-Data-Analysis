  <summary>9/21/2006--Introduced.
Sons and Daughters of America Act - Amends the Revised Statutes of the United States to provide that the remedies for a civil action for deprivation of rights are limited to injunctive and declaratory relief where the deprivation: (1) consists of a violation of the right to freedom of speech secured by the Constitution; and (2) is the result of a statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage which prohibits or restricts picketing, protesting, or demonstrating at a funeral or any other ceremony, procession, or memorial service held in connection with the burial or cremation of the dead. Prohibits the award of attorney's fees with respect to the prevailing party in such a claim, including one in any action brought against the United States or any federal agency or official acting in his or her official capacity in any court.</summary>
