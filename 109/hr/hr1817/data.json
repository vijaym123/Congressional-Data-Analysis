Subtitle B: Homeland Security Information Sharing and Analysis Enhancement - Homeland Security Information Sharing and Analysis Enhancement Act of 2005 - (Sec. 212) Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) to expand the responsibilities of the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (Under Secretary), including with regard to dissemination of information relevant to critical infrastructure sectors and information concerning the use of nuclear or biological terrorism to inflict mass casualties or other catastrophic consequences.

(Sec. 215) Requires the Under Secretary to assign specified Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection functions to the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis, the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection, and the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity. (Sec. 216) States that the Secretary shall be tresponsible for coordinating all homeland security threat analysis to be provided to State and local governments, tribal officials, and the private sector. Prohibits Federal officials from disseminating such information to State, local, tribal, or private sector officials without the coordination of the Secretary, except: (1) in exigent circumstances requiring immediate communication; or (2) when such information is issued to State, local, or tribal law enforcement officials to assist in the administration of criminal justice. (Sec. 217) Establishes the 9/11 Memorial Homeland Security Fellows Program to bring State, local, tribal, and private sector officials to participate in the Homeland Security Operations Center.
