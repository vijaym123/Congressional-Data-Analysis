Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize the President to make community disaster loans to any state government which may suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenue as a result of a major disaster, and has demonstrated a need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions. Removes the $5 million cap set for community disaster loans. Provides that in the case of a community disaster loan made to a state or local government which suffers a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster the President determines to be an incident of national significance: (1) the amount of the loan shall not be subject to the current limitation of 25% of the annual operating budget of that state or local government for the fiscal year in which the major disaster occurs; and (2) the President shall not require the payment of any interest or principal on a loans."
