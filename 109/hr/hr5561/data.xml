  <summary>6/8/2006--Introduced.
Homes for Heroes Act - Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide assistance to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives to expand the supply of supportive housing for very low-income (not exceeding 50 percent of area median income) veteran families. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to: (1) make housing rental vouchers available to homeless veterans; and (2) include veterans in public housing planning. Excludes veterans' benefits from income for purposes of HUD assisted housing rental determinations. Requires the Secretary to: (1) make grants to nonprofit entities for technical assistance in sponsoring HUD housing projects for veterans; and (2) report annually to specified congressional committees on HUD activities relating to veterans. Amends the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act to establish in HUD a Special Assistant for Veterans Affairs to: (1) ensure veteran access to HUD housing and homeless assistance programs; (2) coordinate all HUD programs and activities relating to veterans; and (3) serve as a HUD liaison with officials of organizations concerned with veterans.</summary>
