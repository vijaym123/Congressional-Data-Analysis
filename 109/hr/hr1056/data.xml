  <summary>3/2/2005--Introduced.
Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act of 2005 - Amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to place limitations on the importation of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine. Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) request a distributor of a chemical in the chain of distribution to provide information on such distribution, including sales; and (2) issue an order, upon determining that a foreign-chain distributor is refusing to cooperate, prohibiting the importation of such substances. Directs the Attorney General, acting through the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, to carry out a MethWatch program to provide information to retailers regarding the purchase of precursor products by individuals who may intend to use them in illicit methamphetamine production. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to require the Attorney General to revoke the authority of a person whose registration includes authority regarding ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine, if such person has received four written notifications that the Attorney General considers the person to be in violation of the Act. Requires a registration that includes authority for the sale of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine at retail to provide that the registration does not permit such a sale in which more than nine grams is sold in a single transaction. Prohibits knowingly or intentionally possessing more than 24 grams of pseudoephedrine unless specified conditions apply, such as the chemical is possessed for a legitimate medical purpose. Authorizes additional funding to support research through the National Institutes of Health toward developing drug alternatives to pseudoephedrine.</summary>
