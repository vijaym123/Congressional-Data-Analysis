Directs the Section to give priority in awarding grants and providing services to prosecutor's offices in States with an average of at least 100 murders per year during the five-year period immediately preceding an application for protection. Authorizes: (1) the Attorney General to make grants to State and local district attorneys and the U.S. attorney for DC for providing such witness protection; (2) each grant recipient to use the grant to provide witness protection or to credit the grant to the Section to cover the Section's costs of providing witness protection on the recipient's behalf; and (3) grants to be awarded only in States with an average of not less than 100 murders per year during the most recent five-year period."
