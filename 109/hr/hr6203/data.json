(Sec. 7) Instructs the Secretary to continue R&D activities targeting: (1) distributed energy; (2) micro-cogeneration technology; and (3) geothermal energy, hydropower, and ocean energy authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. (Sec. 8) Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary to: (1) implement an R&D program for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric drive transportation; and (2) establish a pilot program to provide competitive grants to state governments, local governments and public entities, and metropolitan transportation authorities for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle demonstration projects. (Sec. 9) Solar Utilization Now Demonstration Act of 2006, or the SUN Act of 2006 - Instructs the Secretary to establish a program of grants to states to demonstrate advanced photovoltaic technology. (Sec. 10) Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot grants program for new building construction or renovation to demonstrate innovative energy efficiency technologies. (Sec. 11) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to revise the guidelines for a geographically dispersed network of Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers. (Sec. 12) Authorizes the Secretary to contribute funds to the National Science Foundation for: (1) the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program; and (2) curriculum development for high performance building design. (Sec. 13) Directs the Secretary to arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to study its October 2005 recommendation to establish an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). (Sec. 14) Directs the Secretary to establish R&D programs for: (1) coal gasification facilities that convert coal into pipeline quality gaseous fuels (methanation); (2) materials to be added to alternative biobased fuels and Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel fuels; and (3) portable, low-cost, and accurate methods and technologies for testing of sulfur content in fuel, including Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel and Low Sulfur Diesel. Directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a physical properties data base and standard reference materials for alternative fuels. (Sec. 16) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to: (1) authorize additional appropriations for specified bioenergy programs; and (2) direct the Secretary, in making awards for integrated biorefinery demonstration projects, to encourage commercial application of biomass technologies for a variety of uses, including biodegradable natural plastics from biomass."
