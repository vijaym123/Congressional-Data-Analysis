Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish an independent panel to assess the homeland security needs of the National Capital Region. Requires the panel to: (1) determine whether the definition of National Capital Region used by the Department of Homeland Security should be modified to include additional areas, including jurisdictions in Maryland and Virginia along Interstate Routes 270, 95, and 66; and (2) determine whether those jurisdictions should be taking actions to prepare for a terrorist attack in the Region, including the construction of necessary facilities, and if so, to make recommendations for appropriate funding.</summary>
