  <summary>12/16/2005--Introduced.
Prohibits the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration) from increasing the number of random body searches or modifying the list of items prohibited from being carried aboard a passenger aircraft operated by a domestic or foreign air carrier in order to permit any item on the list as of December 1, 2005, to be carried aboard such an aircraft until: (1) each high risk airport is equipped with walk through explosive detection equipment at security checkpoints; (2) the Assistant Secretary conducts a security-risk assessment of common items that may be carried aboard a passenger aircraft for their potential use in a terrorist incident and develops standards for the inclusion or removal of such items on the list of prohibited items based on the level of risk; and (3) the Assistant Secretary develops guidelines to determine when a body search is warranted.</summary>
