  <summary>1/4/2005--Introduced.
Rural America Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to prohibit the Secretary of the Army or a State from issuing a permit to a governmental entity for the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters where Act compliance is based on a permit condition requiring mitigation of adverse impacts to wetlands through the acquisition of private property if the property is: (1) being acquired by condemnation; and (2) located outside a certain U.S. Geological Survey cataloging unit in which the wetland is located. Allows issuance of such a permit upon payment of compensation equaling or exceeding the property's fair market value or the average fair market value of a parcel the size of the property in the cataloging unit in which the wetland is located.</summary>
