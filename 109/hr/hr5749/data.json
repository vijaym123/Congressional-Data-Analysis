Requires commercial website operators to place warning marks prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission on web pages that contain sexually explicit material. Includes within the definitions of racketeering activity and money laundering the crimes of child pornography and child sexual exploitation. Expands civil remedies for victims of sex crimes against children. Establishes in the Department of Justice an Office on Sexual Violence and Crimes against Children. Authorizes additional (not less than 200) U.S. attorneys in FY2007 to prosecute crimes relating to the sexual exploitation of children.
