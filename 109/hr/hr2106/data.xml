  <summary>5/4/2005--Introduced.
Employee Pension Preservation and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to permit commercial passenger airline pension plans to elect to restructure their unfunded plan liabilities over a 25-year period. Prohibits plans that elect restructuring to accrue future unfunded pension plan liabilities. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to deny tax-exempt status to a successor of a plan restructured under this Act unless all benefit obligations of the restructured plan have been satisfied. Amends ERISA to exempt the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) from liability for any unfunded pension plan liabilities incurred by commercial passenger airline pension plans after an election to restructure is made.</summary>
