  <summary>5/12/2005--Introduced.
Rail Security Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to: (1) develop a security assessment of railroad transportation identifying critical railroad assets and infrastructures, including threats and vulnerabilities specific to the rail transportation of hazardous materials; (2) use the security assessment to develop a transportation modal security plan that establishes a strategy for minimizing terrorist threats to railroad transportation systems; (3) develop prioritized recommendations for improving railroad security; (4) carry out a research and development (R&amp;D) program to improve railroad security; (5) develop guidance for a rail worker security traning program to prepare rail workers for potential threat conditions; and (6) develop a national plan for public outreach and awareness to increase awareness of measures that the general public and railroad passengers and employees can take to increase railroad system security. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to freight and passenger railroad carriers (including shippers of hazardous materials) for security upgrades to prevent or respond to acts of terrorism or sabotage. Authorizes appropriations to Amtrak for fire and life-safety improvements and infrastructure upgrades to certain tunnels in New York, New York, Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. Sets forth certain whistleblower protections for rail employees or other persons providing information about perceived security threats. Directs the Secretary to analyze the cost and feasibility of requiring security screening for passengers, baggage, and cargo on passenger trains. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) issue emergency responder training standards; and (2) provide grants to Operation Respond Institute. Amends Federal transportation law to require the Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), as soon as practicable after a rail passenger accident involving a major loss of life, to: (1) designate and publicize a NTSB employee who shall be a director of support services for the families of passengers involved; and (2) designate an independent, experienced nonprofit organization with primary responsibility for coordinating the emotional care and support of such families. Directs each rail passenger carrier to submit to the Secretary of Transportation and the Chairman of the NTSB a plan for addressing the needs of such families. Directs the Secretary to establish a task force to develop a model plan to assist passenger rail carriers in responding to passenger rail accidents.</summary>
