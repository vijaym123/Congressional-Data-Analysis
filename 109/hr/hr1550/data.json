Directs the President to provide assistance to children who are orphaned or currently unaccompanied as a result of the Indian Ocean tsunami. Authorizes FY 2005 and 2006 appropriations from certain Department of State authorizations for U.S. contributions to Interpol for its disaster victim identification efforts relating to the Indian Ocean tsunami. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) should increase efforts to support U.S.-sponsored private investment in countries affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami. Authorizes the President to provide assistance for regional and international programs, including providing such assistance through the United Nation's (UN) International Early Warning Program, to establish all-hazard event public warning systems in foreign countries. Authorizes appropriations to replenish funds expended for specified assistance provided in the immediate aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami. Directs: (1) the President to designate a senior U.S. official to coordinate assistance under this Act; (2) the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to have primary responsibility for providing such assistance; and (3) the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to monitor the provision of such assistance."
