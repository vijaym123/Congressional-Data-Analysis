    "text": "Amends the USEC Privatization Act to repeal Federal guidelines governing inventory sales of natural and low-enriched uranium and Federal transfers of enriched uranium.Establishes rising limits of aggregate annual deliveries of uranium in any form (including natural uranium concentrates, natural uranium hexafluoride, enriched uranium, and depleted uranium) that are sold or transferred by the U.S. Government from three million pounds U308 equivalent per year through calendar 2009 to ten million pounds U308 equivalent per year through calendar 2013 and thereafter. Exempts specified kinds of sales or transfers from these limits.States that any uranium sales or transfers by the U.S. Government (excluding the Tennessee Valley Authority) shall be limited to long-term contracts with end users of no less than three years duration.Requires the Secretary of Energy to review annually the available excess Government uranium inventories and determine the level of inventory to be sold or transferred to end users."
