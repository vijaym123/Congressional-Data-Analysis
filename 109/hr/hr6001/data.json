Requires the Director, in order to determine if an individual is qualified and ensure that the system is efficient, to: (1) establish registration criteria that provides simple but specific instructions to registrants regarding the required information; (2) require registrants to provide their name exactly as it appears on their social security card; (3) test the system prior to implementation; (4) ensure that call center employees give prompt feedback regarding whether the registrant's identity has been validated; and (5) establish an expeditious appeal and alternative verification process for a registrant who is rejected."
