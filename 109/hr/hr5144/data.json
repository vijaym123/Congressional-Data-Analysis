Restricts the use and disclosure of such voluntarily submitted information and sets penalties for unauthorized disclosure by federal officers or employees. Authorizes the Secretary to provide warnings to relevant companies, targeted sectors, other governmental entities, or the general public regarding potential risks to the supply chain."
