  <summary>4/6/2006--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) develop a secure electronic data interchange system to collect from and share risk information related to securing the supply chain with appropriate private sector entities; (2) establish uniform procedures for the receipt, care, and storage of supply chain security information that is voluntarily submitted to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the system; and (3) develop protocols for determining appropriate private sector personnel who shall have access to the system, including designated security officers within companies determined to be low risk through participation in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program. Restricts the use and disclosure of such voluntarily submitted information and sets penalties for unauthorized disclosure by federal officers or employees. Authorizes the Secretary to provide warnings to relevant companies, targeted sectors, other governmental entities, or the general public regarding potential risks to the supply chain.</summary>
