Makes it unlawful for any person to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in ammonium nitrate compound materials without a license. Requires the Attorney General to promulgate regulations specifically related to the storage of such compounds. Modifies requirements for explosive material licenses and user permits to exempt an applicant from the fee for a license or user permit for ammonium nitrate compound. Excludes employees who will be authorized to possess ammonium nitrate compounds from the requirement that they be checked for convictions of certain felonies. Sets forth fines and penalties for violation of this Act."
