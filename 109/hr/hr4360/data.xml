Authorizes the sheriffs in these counties to: (1) coordinate law enforcement operations in support of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement; (2) conduct law enforcement operations in their counties in order to enforce criminal laws and protect lives, property, and security; (3) transfer aliens detained or taken into custody who are not lawfully present in the United States to appropriate federal law enforcement officials; (4) enforce state and federal laws relating to controlled substance trafficking and other criminal laws other than immigration laws (except as provided in an agreement with DHS); and (5) be paid for the costs of performing such duties or functions by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security. Creates the Designated County Law Enforcement Account in the Treasury. Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary to jointly issue regulations that govern the distribution of funds under this Act and provide uniform standards that all other federal law enforcement officials shall follow to cooperate with such sheriffs.</summary>
