    "text": "Federal Energy Management Improvement Act of 2005 - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA) to update energy reduction goals for federal buildings for FY2006-FY2015. Cites conditions that exempt federal buildings from having to meet those goals. Includes within NECPA purview Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP)-designated products and products rated for energy efficiency under an Energy Star program. Prescribes procedural guidelines for mandatory procurement of energy efficient products by the head of an executive agency. Prohibits all federal agencies combined from: (1) entering into more than a total of 100 Energy Savings Performance Contracts; and (2) making payments under all contracts which exceed a total of $500 million. Requires each federal agency to appoint a coordinator for Energy Savings Performance Contracts to monitor the number of such contracts for that agency and the investment value of each contract. Directs the President to seek to ensure that the total amount of electric energy consumed by the federal government during any fiscal year includes specified percentages of renewable energy. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to exempt from the federal civil service pension offset any annuitants with critical skills who were formerly a NRC employees but are hired as consultants. Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to extend whistleblower protections to employees of NRC contractors or subcontractors. Allows federal agencies to qualify for a waiver of the requirement for the use of alternative fuels by dual-fueled vehicles in a particular geographic area where the alternative fuel is not reasonably available or its cost is unreasonably more expansive compared to gasoline. Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to create an additional Assistant Secretary position for management of nuclear energy issues. Directs the Secretary of Energy to study and report to Congress on the energy conservation implications of the widespread adoption of telecommuting by federal employees in the United States."
