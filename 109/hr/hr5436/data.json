Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to forgive the student loan debt of a borrower who: (1) enters a written agreement with the Secretary to remain employed full-time as a family law, dependency, or domestic relations attorney for at least three years; and (2) is not in default on a loan for which the borrower seeks forgiveness. Limits the amount that the Secretary may pay to no more than $6,000 in any year for any borrower or $50,000 in the aggregate for any borrower. Authorizes the Secretary to renew such agreements. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a comparative study of state dependency courts and foster care systems. Expresses the sense of Congress with respect to: (1) court accountability for improved child outcomes; (2) the organization of state dependency courts; (3) building the pool of attorneys qualified to handle cases in dependency courts; and (4) training, caseloads, and compensation of attorneys for children."
