Amends SSA title XVIII, as amended by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, to repeal the phase-out, and instead extend indefinitely application, of the budget neutrality factor in the health status adjustment in determining the amount of payments to Medicare Advantage Organizations. (The budget neutrality factor reflects changes in treatment and coding practices in the fee-for-service sector, as well as differences in coding patterns between Medicare Advantage plans and providers under part A and B, to the extent that the Secretary has identified such differences.)"
