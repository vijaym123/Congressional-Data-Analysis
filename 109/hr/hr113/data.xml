  <summary>1/4/2005--Introduced.
Requires the Secretary of Transportation to determine apportionments to States of Federal-aid highway funds for FY 2006 or any subsequent fiscal year in a particular manner if FY 2005 or any preceding fiscal year is taken into account in the computation. Directs the Secretary, in such an instance, to use the amount of estimated tax receipts that would have resulted if certain alcohol fuel mixture and biodiesel mixture excise tax credits under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 had taken effect at the beginning of the fiscal year taken into account.</summary>
