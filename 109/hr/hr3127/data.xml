  <summary>10/13/2006--Public Law.
Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 - (Sec. 4) Sets forth the sense of Congress with respect to the situation in Darfur, Sudan, including the sense of Congress that the atrocities unfolding in Darfur are genocide, and the need for U.S. and international involvement in Darfur. (Sec. 5) Amends the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 to direct the President, with waiver authority upon congressional notification, to block the assets and deny visas and entry to any individual complicit in or responsible for acts of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity in Darfur, including family members or associates of such individual to whom assets or property of such individual was transferred on or after July 1, 2002. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should impose sanctions against any individual, including the Janjaweed commanders and coordinators, who impede the peace process, constitute a threat to stability in Darfur and the region, or commit violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the President to provide assistance: (1) to reinforce an expanded African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS); and (2) in the areas of logistics, communications, technical assistance, training, command and control, aerial surveillance, and intelligence. States that such assistance shall: (1) be used only in Darfur; and (2) not be provided until AMIS has agreed not to transfer any such assistance to anyone not an officer, employee or agent of AMIS (or subsequent U.N. peacekeeping operation), and not to use or to permit the use of such assistance for other purposes without prior presidential consent. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should instruct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to: (1) advocate NATO reinforcement of AMIS; (2) provide assets to help deter air strikes against civilians and humanitarian workers in Darfur; and (3) provide other support. States that the President should take steps to deny the government of Sudan access to oil revenues, including prohibiting U.S. port entry to cargo ships or oil tankers engaged in trade activities in Sudan's oil sector or involved in the shipment of goods for the Armed Forces of Sudan until the government of Sudan has honored its commitments to cease attacks on civilians, demobilize and demilitarize the Janjaweed and associated militias, grant access for humanitarian assistance, and allow for the safe and voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced persons. Exempts from such prohibition cargo ships or oil tankers involved in: (1) an internationally recognized demobilization program; (2) the shipment of non-lethal assistance for the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan (Agreement) or the Darfur Agreement; and (3) the shipment of military assistance necessary to carry out such Agreements if the President has made a determination required by this Act. Prohibits, with national interest waiver authority, U.S. assistance to a country in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591(embargo on military assistance to Sudan). (Sec. 7) States that certain restrictions against the government of Sudan shall remain in place until the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the government of Sudan is taking specified steps to: (1) implement the Darfur Peace Agreement; (2) disarm and demobilize the Janjaweed and all government-allied militias; (3) adhere to all associated Security Council Resolutions; (4) negotiate a peaceful resolution to the crisis in eastern Sudan; (5) cooperate with efforts to disarm and deny safe haven to members of the Lord's Resistance Army in Sudan; and (6) implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan. Authorizes the President to waive such restriction for national security purposes. (Sec. 8) Amends the Assistance for International Malaria Control Act to repeal provisions authorizing the President to provide additional assistance to, and exempting prohibitions on exports from, areas outside the control of the government of Sudan. Amends the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 to repeal the provision authorizing the President to provide additional nonmilitary assistance to areas outside the control of the government of Sudan. Authorizes the President, subject to congressional notification by the Secretary of State, to provide economic assistance for Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, Abyei, Darfur, and marginalized areas in and around Khartoum. Authorizes the President, if a specified certification of noncompliance by the government of Sudan or the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army with the Agreement has not been made, and if in the U.S. national interest, to provide specified military assistance to the government of Sudan for FY2006-FY2008. Requires congressional notification. Waives specified export prohibitions under the Arms Export Control Act. Requires the President to provide Congress with end use assurances for each item exported under this section. Waives prohibitions concerning Sudan in Executive Order No. 13067 regarding activities with respect to Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, Abyei, Darfur, or marginalized areas in and around Khartoum. (Sec. 9) Includes among reporting requirements reports on: (1) AMIS; (2) sanctions in support of peace in Darfur; and (3) U.S. military assistance under the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006.</summary>
