Requires in any excluded action: (1) a stay of discovery during the pendency of any motion to dismiss, unless necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice; and (2) evidence preservation during the stay. Requires the complaint in such an action to plead with particularity for each defendant and cause of action: (1) each element of the cause of action and the specific facts alleged to satisfy each element of the cause of action; (2) the federal and state statutes that allegedly create the cause of action; and (3) the exception under this Act that is being relied upon and the specific facts that allegedly satisfy the requirements of that exception."
