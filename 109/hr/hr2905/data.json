Requires the Administrator to study the feasibility of installing and operating counter-MANPADS systems on similar aircraft that provide all-cargo air transportation. Defines MANPADS as a surface-to-air missile system designed to be man-portable and carried and fired by a single individual, or any other surface-to-air missile system designed to be carried, operated, and fired by more than one individual acting as a crew."
