Expresses the sense of Congress that state departments of transportation should take project descriptions in certain set-aside bridge program projects and specified TIP projects under SAFETEA-LU into consideration if such projects involve improving transportation safety. Rescinds for FY2006 a specified amount of state unobligated balances of funds for the Interstate maintenance, national highway system, bridge, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement, surface transportation (other than the STP set-aside programs), metropolitan planning, minimum guarantee, Appalachian development highway system, recreational trails, safe routes to school, freight intermodal connectors, coordinated border infrastructure, high risk rural road, high priority projects, and TIPs and each of the STP set-aside programs. Rescinds 10% of amounts appropriated for FY2007-FY2009 by SAFETEA-LU (including the equity bonus program), but excluding amounts appropriated for the highway safety improvement program."
