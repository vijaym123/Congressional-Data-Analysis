  <summary>4/12/2005--Passed House amended.
Southern California Groundwater Remediation Act - Establishes within the Treasury the Southern California Groundwater Remediation Fund, which shall be used by the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, to provide grants to a local water authority within the natural watershed of the Santa Ana River in California for the federal share of costs associated with designing and constructing groundwater remediation projects. Prohibits the Secretary from obligating any funds appropriated to the Fund in a fiscal year until the Secretary has deposited a matching amount provided by non-federal interests of at least 35 percent for a project. Makes each authority responsible for providing the required non-federal amount. Directs the Secretary to credit the appropriate authority with the value of all prior compatible expenditures by non-federal interests made after January 1, 2000. Authorizes appropriations. Terminates this Act ten years after the enactment date.</summary>
