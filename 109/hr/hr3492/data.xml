  <summary>7/27/2005--Introduced.
Consumer Credit Card Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit a creditor from using adverse information concerning a consumer as the basis for increasing any annual percentage rate of interest applicable to a credit card account of the consumer under an open end consumer credit plan, or to remove or increase any introductory annual percentage rate of interest applicable to such account, for reasons other than actions or omissions of the consumer that are directly related to such account (universal default). Expands mandatory disclosures governing an open end consumer credit plan to include clear and conspicuous minimum payment terms with respect to the outstanding balance on the account, including prescribed details expressed in tabular format and in close proximity. Requires a creditor to furnish advance notice as a prerequisite to increasing rates or imposing fees on a consumer credit card account.</summary>
