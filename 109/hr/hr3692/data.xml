  <summary>9/7/2005--Introduced.
Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act - Establishes within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a Marine Debris Prevention and Removal Program of project grants to reduce and prevent the occurrence and adverse impacts of marine debris on the marine environment and navigation safety. Requires the Administrator of NOAA to: (1) undertake marine debris mapping, impact assessment, prevention, and removal efforts, with a focus on marine debris posing a threat to living marine resources (particularly endangered or protected species) and navigation safety; (2) improve efforts and actively seek to prevent and reduce fishing gear losses, as well as their adverse impacts on living marine resources and navigation safety; and (3) undertake outreach and education of the public and other stakeholders in the fishing, fishing gear manufacturers, and other marine-dependent industries on sources of and threats associated with marine debris and approaches to identify, determine sources of, reduce, and prevent such debris and its adverse impacts on the marine environment and navigational safety. Directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to undertake measures to reduce violations of MARPOL Annex V (Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973) and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships with respect to the discard of plastics and other garbage from vessels. Establishes an Interagency Committee on Marine Debris to: (1) coordinate a comprehensive program of marine debris research and activities among federal agencies, in cooperation with nongovernmental organizations, industry, universities, state governments, Indian tribes, and other nations; and (2) foster cost-effective mechanisms to identify, determine sources of, reduce, and prevent marine debris and its adverse impact on the marine environment and navigational safety, including the joint funding of research and mitigation and prevention strategies.</summary>
