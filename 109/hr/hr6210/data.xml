Automatic IRA Act of 2006 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) require certain small employers who do not offer qualified retirement plans or arrangements to their employees to allow eligible employees to participate in a payroll deposit individual retirement account (IRA) arrangement (automatic IRAs); (2) allow employers who do not have more than 100 employees a tax credit for costs associated with establishing a payroll deposit IRA arrangement; and (3) treat automatic IRAs as individual retirement accounts (and as Roth IRAs) for income tax purposes. Establishes in the executive branch the TSP II Board to establish policies and procedures relating to payroll deposit IRA arrangements.</summary>
