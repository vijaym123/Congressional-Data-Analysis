  <summary>10/28/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make or guarantee a loan to a small business that has suffered, or is likely to suffer, substantial economic injury as a result of a significant increase in the price of heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, transportation fuel, propane, or kerosene. Prohibits such a loan or guarantee if the total amount outstanding and committed to the borrower would exceed $1.5 million (with an exception). Prohibits any such assistance unless there has been a declaration of a disaster in the area or the governor of the state involved has certified that small businesses have suffered economic injury as a result of the price increases. Allows a small business to use assistance funds to convert to a renewable or alternative energy source.</summary>
