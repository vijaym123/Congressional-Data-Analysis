Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to prohibit: (1) introduction into commerce of prerecorded digital music disc products that are mislabeled, or falsely, or deceptively advertised or invoiced; and (2) removal or mutilation of any label required by either this Act or any rules or regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission before the time a prerecorded digital music disc product is sold and delivered to the ultimate consumer. States that such transactions constitute either an unfair method of competition, or an unfair and deceptive act or practice in commerce.Authorizes the Commission to develop rules and regulations governing such transactions. Amends Federal copyright law to exempt from its prohibitions against circumvention of copyright protection systems any persons acting solely in furtherance of scientific research into technological measures. Declares it is not a violation of copyright law, but fair use, to: (1) circumvent a technological measure in order to obtain access to a work for purposes of making noninfringing use of the work; or (2) manufacture or distribute a hardware or software product capable of substantial noninfringing uses except in instances of direct infringement.</summary>
