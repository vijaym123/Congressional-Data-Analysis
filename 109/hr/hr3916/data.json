Requires each Millennium Challenge Compact (a compact required to be entered into by each participating country) to include a plan to promote environmental sustainability, including prevention, minimization, mitigation, or compensation for the potential adverse impact on natural resources in the implementation of programs and activities funded under the Compact. Provides for the input of non-governmental organizations concerning Compact creation. Requires the inclusion, in an annual report under the Act, of information on progress made toward implementing the country's plan for environmental sustainability. Directs that each report be published in the Federal Register and made available on the Internet."
