(2) allowing three-year income averaging, for income tax purposes, of retirement plan distributions for Hurricane Wilma relief; (3) allowing the recontribution of retirement plan distributions intended for home purchases that were canceled due to Hurricane Wilma; (4) allowing tax-free loans from retirement plans for Hurricane Wilma relief; (5) suspending limitations on the tax deduction for the charitable contributions of corporations for Hurricane Wilma relief; (6) increasing the standard mileage rate for the charitable use of a vehicle for Hurricane Wilma relief; (7) excluding from the gross income of charitable volunteers reimbursements for the use of automobiles to provide Hurricane Wilma relief; (8) suspending limitations on the tax deduction for personal casualty losses attributable to Hurricane Wilma; and (9) extending from two to five years the mandatory replacement period for property compulsorily or involuntarily converted due to Hurricane Wilma. Declares that any provision of this Act causing an effect on receipts, budget authority, or outlays is designated as an emergency requirement (pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 [109th Congress])."
