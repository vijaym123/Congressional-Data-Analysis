(2) allowing three-year income averaging, for income tax purposes, of retirement plan distributions for Hurricane Wilma relief; (3) allowing the recontribution of retirement plan distributions intended for home purchases that were canceled due to Hurricane Wilma; (4) allowing tax-free loans from retirement plans for Hurricane Wilma relief; (5) suspending limitations on the tax deduction for the charitable contributions of corporations for Hurricane Wilma relief; (6) increasing the standard mileage rate for the charitable use of a vehicle for Hurricane Wilma relief; (7) excluding from the gross income of charitable volunteers reimbursements for the use of automobiles to provide Hurricane Wilma relief; (8) suspending limitations on the tax deduction for personal casualty losses attributable to Hurricane Wilma; and (9) extending from two to five years the mandatory replacement period for property compulsorily or involuntarily converted due to Hurricane Wilma.

Res. 95 [109th Congress]).</summary>
