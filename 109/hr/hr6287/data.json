    "text": "National Heritage Areas Partnership Act - Establishes a National Heritage Areas System through which the Secretary of the Interior shall provide technical and financial assistance to local coordinating entities to support the establishment, development, and continuity of National Heritage Areas. Directs the Secretary to assess and report on the feasibility of designating proposed Areas and on the future of Areas already designated. Specifies feasibility criteria, including that an Area has an assemblage of natural, historic, or cultural resources that tell a nationally important story. States that designation of an Area shall be: (1) by Act of Congress; and (2) contingent on the prior completion of a feasibility study and an affirmative determination by the Secretary that the area meets such criteria. Sets forth requirements for Area management plans. Instructs local coordinating entities to submit plans to the Secretary for approval. Specifies approval criteria, including that resource protection and interpretation strategies would adequately protect, enhance, and interpret the natural, historic, scenic, and cultural resources of the Area. Requires local coordinating entities to submit annual reports on performance goals, accomplishments, finances, and expenditures. Sets forth such entities' authority for using federal funds. Authorizes appropriations for such Areas. Terminates the Secretary's authority to provide financial assistance (to be matched by such entities) 15 years after enactment of the law designating an Area."
