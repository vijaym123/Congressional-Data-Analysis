  <summary>3/8/2006--Passed House amended.
Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2005 - Title I: National Bank Provisions - (Sec. 101) Amends the Revised Statutes of the United States to authorize the Comptroller of the Currency to permit an individual to serve as director of a national bank operating as a subchapter S corporation if the individual holds debt issued by the bank of at least $1,000 that is subordinated to the interests of bank depositors and general creditors. (Current law requires capital stock ownership in the bank as a prerequisite for service as a director of a subchapter S national bank.) (Sec. 102) Allows cumulative voting by shareholders for directors of a national bank only if authorized by the bank's articles of association (thus repealing the current requirement of cumulative voting). (Sec. 103) Repeals the statutory formula for determining when lawful national bank dividend declarations may be made. Allows national bank directors to declare a dividend of so much of the bank's undivided profits as they judge to be expedient. (Sec. 104) Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to repeal the prerequisite to a removal or suspension order by the Comptroller of the Currency concerning an institution-affiliated party requiring a notice to provide for a hearing, and for the findings and conclusions of an administrative law judge have been certified to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for final determination. (Thus repeals a limitation placed upon the removal authority of the Comptroller.) (Sec. 105) Amends the Revised Statutes to eliminate the requirement for a national bank to meet state capital (stock and surplus) requirements for new intrastate branches in order to establish an intrastate branch. (Sec. 106) Amends the National Bank Consolidation and Merger Act to authorize waiver of publication of notice of a merger between a national bank or a state bank and a national banking association upon unanimous agreement of the shareholders without a Comptroller determination that an emergency exists justifying such waiver (as currently required). Continues to allow such waiver if the Comptroller makes such a determination, even if the shareholders of the state bank or the association are not in unanimous agreement. (Sec. 107) Revises the prohibition against receipt of deposits by a foreign bank at a federal agency to limit it to receipt of deposits from U.S. citizens or residents. (Thus allows a foreign bank to receive foreign source uninsured deposits at a federal agency.) (Sec. 108) Restricts the prohibition against foreign bank maintenance of a federal branch and a federal agency in the same state to those states that prohibit such a maintenance (thus allowing such maintenance where state law does not forbid it). (Sec. 109) Amends the Revised Statutes to: (1) authorize Comptroller regulations permitting a national bank to be organized other than as a body corporate (thus permitting an alternative business organization); and (2) declare that the main place of business of a national bank is the location of its main office (a significant factor for federal diversity jurisdiction). (Sec. 111) Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 to revise the requirements for capital equivalency deposits of a federal branch or agency of a foreign bank. Prohibits the governing regulations from permitting a foreign bank from keeping assets on deposit in an amount less than that prescribed by a state for a state-licensed branch or agency of a foreign bank. Repeals the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency to prescribe different asset requirements for branches or agencies in different states, in order to ensure competitive equality of federal branches and agencies with state branches and agencies and domestic banks in those states. (Sec. 112) Amends the Revised Statutes to increase from 10% to 15% of capital stock actually paid in and unimpaired, and of the association's unimpaired surplus fund, the maximum aggregate that a national banking association may invest in community development projects. Title II: Savings Association Provisions - (Sec. 201) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to extend their purview to savings associations (thereby subjecting such associations to the same investment adviser and broker-dealer registration requirements as banks). (Sec. 202) Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) to prescribe guidelines for investments by a federal savings association to promote the public welfare. Establishes an aggregate limit on investments of 5% of an association's unimpaired capital and surplus unless: (1) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) determines a higher amount poses no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund; and (2) the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) determines the association is adequately capitalized. Sets a maximum aggregate investment limit of ten percent of capital and surplus. Repeals the limitation which restricts an investment by a federal savings association in certain community developments to two percent of its assets. (Sec. 203) Permits a federal savings association to merge with any nondepository institution affiliate. (Sec. 204) Repeals: (1) the dividend notice requirement for a savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company (but grants discretionary authority to the OTS Director to require one); and (2) the special rules for purchased mortgage servicing rights. (Sec. 205) Revises HOLA requirements governing holding companies to cover any business trust or any other trust that owns a savings association (unless by its terms the trust terminates within 25 years, or not later than 21 years and ten months after the death of individuals living on the trust's effective date). (Sec. 207) Increases from 1% to up to 5% the amount of its capital and assets a federal savings association may invest in a small business investment company. (Sec. 208) Permits a federal savings association to invest in, sell, or otherwise deal in motor vehicle loans and leases for personal, family, or household purposes without a percentage of assets limitation. (Sec. 209) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to exempt an agent representing one federal savings association from mandatory state qualification as a securities broker or dealer if the agent sells or offers FDIC-insured certificate of deposit products issued by such association. (Sec. 210) Amends HOLA to permit a federal savings association to offer funeral and cemetery-related fiduciary services. (Sec. 211) Repeals the qualified thrift lender requirements placed upon out-of-state branches of a federal savings association. (Sec. 212) Permits a federal savings association to deal in small business loans without a percentage of assets limitation. Repeals the requirement that, if the aggregate amount of federal savings association loans for commercial, corporate, business, or agricultural purposes exceeds 10% of the association&#146;s total assets, all loans in excess of that percentage must be small business loans only. (Thus allows business loans up to the current maximum of 20% of total assets, regardless of whether they are small business loans or any other kind of business loan.) (Sec. 213) Considers a federal savings association to be a citizen only of the state in which its home office is located for purposes of determining federal court diversity jurisdiction. (Sec. 214) Increases from 400% to 500% of capital the aggregate limit on nonresidential (commercial) real estate loans by a federal savings association. (Sec. 215) Revises the conditions under which a savings association may make loans (up to a certain amount of the association's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus) to one borrower to develop domestic residential housing units. Repeals the limitation of the purchase price of each single family dwelling unit to $500,000. (Sec. 216) Amends HOLA to exclude a credit card savings association from the meaning of savings association subject to the Act, for specified purposes. (Sec. 217) Permits interstate acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies under the same rules that apply to bank holding companies. (Sec. 218) Authorizes the OTS Director to prescribe regulations that: (1) permit a federal savings association to be organized other than as a corporation; and (2) provide requirements for the organizational characteristics of such an association, consistent with its safety and soundness. Declares that a federal savings association operating other than as a corporation shall have the same rights and privileges, and shall be subject to the same duties, restrictions, penalties, liabilities, conditions, and limitations, as a federal savings association organized as a corporation. Title III: Credit Union Provisions - (Sec. 301) Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to permit a privately insured credit union to become a Federal Home Loan Bank member if the supervisor of its charter state certifies that it meets all eligibility requirements for federal deposit insurance. (Sec. 302) Amends the Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA) to allow military and civilian authorities responsible for buildings erected on federal property to extend real estate leases at minimal charge to credit unions that finance the construction of credit union facilities on federal land. (Sec. 303) Amends the FCUA to authorize a credit union, in addition to investments otherwise authorized, to make investment securities for its own account (up to ten percent of its net worth for the total amount of investment securities of any single obligor or maker). (Sec. 304) Increases the maturity date on Federal Credit Union loans from 12 years to 15 years or longer, as permitted by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Board. (Sec. 305) Raises the ceiling on an individual federal credit union's aggregate investment in credit union service organizations from one percent to three percent of its shares and undivided earnings. (Sec. 306) Excludes loans made to nonprofit religious organizations from the restrictions placed upon member business loans relating to credit union net worth or capitalization standards. (Sec. 307) Permits a federal credit union to offer money transfer instruments, including international and domestic electronic fund transfers, to persons in the field of membership (currently limited to actual members). (Sec. 308) Provides that the numerical limitation of 3,000 members shall not apply to a Board-approved merger involving multiple voluntary common-bond credit unions. (Sec. 309) Requires the NCUA Board to prescribe criteria under which it may determine that in the case of a voluntary conversion of a common-bond credit union into a community credit union that a member group or other portion of a credit union's existing membership, located outside the well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district constituting the community charter, can be satisfactorily served by the credit union and remain within the community credit union's field of membership. (Sec. 310) Authorizes a credit union board, by majority vote of a quorum, to adopt and enforce a policy of expulsion from membership, by majority vote of the whole board, based on just cause, including disruption of credit union operations. Authorizes credit union bylaws to set term limits for credit union board of directors. Provides that reimbursement for lost wages owing to voluntary service on a credit union board of directors shall not be treated as prohibited compensation. (Sec. 311) Revises the criteria by which the NCUA Board may determine that an increase in money market interest rates justifies raising the 15 percent per annum interest rate ceiling on the unpaid loan balance. Changes the current requirement that: (1) money market interest rates have risen over the preceding six-month period; and (2) prevailing interest rate levels threaten the safety and soundness of individual credit unions. (Makes such criteria alternative rather than joint, thus allowing the Board to raise the maximum rate on the basis of either condition instead of on the basis only of both together.) (Sec. 312) Amends the Clayton Act to exempt from its premerger notification and waiting period requirements any mergers among insured credit unions whose transaction value exceeds $50 million and which require agency approval under the FCUA. (Sec. 313) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to treat credit unions as depository institutions for certain purposes. (Sec. 314) Revises the meaning of net worth, with respect to prompt corrective action by a credit union, to include (in addition to the credit union's retained earnings balance) any amounts that were previously retained earnings of any other credit union with which the credit union has combined. (Sec. 315) Amends the FDIA regarding depository institutions insured by private (nonfederal) deposit insurers to authorize the state supervisor of a private deposit insurer, and any appropriate state supervisor of a depository institution receiving privately insured deposits, to examine such institutions and enforce compliance with the FDIA. Revises the requirement that any depository institution lacking federal deposit insurance include conspicuous notices that it is not federally insured in all instruments evidencing a deposit. Replaces "instruments evidencing a deposit" with the term "share certificate." Specifies general exceptions to the disclosure requirement. Requires disclosure of the absence of federal deposit insurance to new depositors obtained through a conversion or merger. Repeals the prohibition against use of an instrumentality of interstate commerce by a nonfederally insured depository institution in order to receive deposits if the appropriate state supervisor has determined it meets all eligibility requirements for federal deposit insurance. Revises the definition of depository institution subject to the FDIA to remove the requirements that such an institution: (1) be engaged in the business of receiving deposits; and (2) could reasonably be mistaken for a depository institution by the entity's current or prospective customers. Repeals Federal Trade Commission (FTC) authority to enforce independent audit requirements. Grants the appropriate state supervisor disclosure enforcement authority over a nonfederally insured depository institution. Title IV: Depository Institution Provisions - (Sec. 401) Amends the Revised Statutes, the FDIA, and the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) to remove certain restrictions on de novo interstate branching by national and state banks and state member and nonmember banks. (Currently state law must expressly permit such branching.) Amends the FDIA to: (1) permit interstate mergers between insured banks of different home states; (2) permit interstate fiduciary activity by a state bank or state-chartered trust company if approved by its state bank supervisor; and (3) prohibit interstate branching by subsidiaries of commercial firms. Exempts ("grandfathers") specified institutions from the latter prohibition. Amends the National Bank Consolidation Merger Act to permit a national bank trust company merger with another trust company of a different home state. Amends the FDIA to declare that its guidelines governing treatment of branches in connection with certain interstate merger transactions shall not be construed as authorizing approval of currently proscribed transactions involving an industrial loan company, or certain other institutions.
