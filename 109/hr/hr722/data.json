    "text": "Securing Transportation Energy Efficiency for Tomorrow Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to authorize the Administrator of General Services to establish a program for the procurement and installation of photovoltaic solar electric systems for electric production in public buildings. Directs the Architect of the Capitol to evaluate the energy infrastructure of the Capitol Complex to determine how it could be augmented to become more energy efficient, using photovoltaic solar energy systems, district-heating, and other unconventional and renewable energy resources. Amends Federal transportation law to: (1) direct the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to establish a program of grants to State and local governments for fuel conservation projects; (2) authorize the Secretary to make grants for fuel cell bus technology projects; and (3) require environmental impact statements for Federal-aid highway and transit projects to consider energy impacts as an environmental project consequence. Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a Conserve By Bicycling pilot program for projects to encourage the use of bicycles in place of motor vehicles; and (2) a specified public-private research partnership dedicated to advancement of railroad technology, efficiency, and safety owned by the Federal Railroad Administration and operated in the private sector. Directs: (1) the Secretary to establish a pilot clean airport bus replacement and fleet expansion grant program; and (2) the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to establish a public-private research partnership to develop a clean ground demonstrator engine utilizing specified National Aeronautics and Space Administration-developed technologies. Directs the Secretary to establish a public-private research partnership to develop and demonstrate technologies that increase fuel economy, reduce emissions, and lower costs of marine transportation, as well as the efficiency of intermodal transfers. Directs the Secretary of the Army to study and report to Congress on the potential for reduced fossil fuel consumption through an increase in U.S. hydropower capabilities. Encourages specified adjacent States to continue to prohibit off-shore drilling in the Great Lakes for oil and gas, and other adjacent States to prohibit such drilling.
