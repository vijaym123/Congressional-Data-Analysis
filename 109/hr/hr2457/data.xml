  <summary>5/18/2005--Introduced.
Employee Ownership Opportunity Act - Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 regarding the requirement that, in connection with its examination of a financial institution, the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community. Requires the agency, in making such assessment, to consider as a factor capital investments, loans, loan participation, technical assistance, and grants by the institution to support or enable employees to establish employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) or eligible worker owned cooperatives (EWOCs) that are at least 51 percent employee-owned plans or cooperatives and employ low- to moderate-income workers.</summary>
