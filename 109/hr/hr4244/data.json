Directs the Attorney General: (1) to consider, in selecting grant recipients and in determining grant amounts, the population of the region to be served, the degree of cooperation between the law enforcement agencies and the financial institutions involved, and the rate of economic crimes in the region; (2) after three fiscal years, to evaluate and report to Congress on the effectiveness of such task forces; and (3) develop and make available a standard form that may be used by a local law enforcement agency in receiving a report that a person is the victim of an economic crime. Prohibits a local law enforcement agency from declining to accept a report of an economic crime from a victim residing in its jurisdiction on the basis that the crime occurred outside such jurisdiction."
