  "summary": {
    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "2006-09-29", 
    "text": "Advanced Telecommunications and Opportunities Reform Act or the Communications Act of 2006 - Title I: War on Terrorism - Subtitle A: Call Home - (Sec. 101) Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reduce the cost of calling home for U.S. military personnel stationed outside the United States in support of military operations, training exercises, or other approved purposes. Repeals provisions of the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992 that are similar but applicable only to specified countries. Subtitle B: Interoperability - (Sec. 151) Amends the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to allocate a portion of the funds available under such Act for: (1) interoperable communications system equipment grants for equipment that can use, or enable interoperability with systems or networks that can use, reallocated public safety spectrum; (2) interoperable emergency communications coordination, planning, and training grants; and (3) establishing a strategic technology reserve to preposition or secure interoperable communications systems for immediate deployment in an emergency or major disaster, including using prenegotiated contracts for rapid deployment rather than warehousing. Requires the FCC to report to Congress on the technical feasibility of creating a back-up emergency communications system providing a framework for development of a resilient interoperable communications system for emergency responders in an emergency. Directs the Secretary to reserve a portion of funds under the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 to provide grants for projects to public safety answering points that enable interoperability and that advance E-911 deployment. (Sec. 152) Amends the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 to substitute references to the Secretary of Homeland Security for references to the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce in provisions relating to grants for public safety interoperable communications. (Sec. 153) Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to award at least $1 billion for public safety interoperable communications grants by September 30, 2006. (Sec. 154) Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to direct the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information and the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to facilitate coordination and communication between specified groups regarding the migration to an IP-enabled emergency network that provides E-911 services. Title II: Universal Service Reform; Interconnection - Internet and Universal Service Act of 2006 - Subtitle A: Contributions to Universal Service - (Sec. 201) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require each communications service provider to contribute to support universal service (the provision of communications service in rural, insular, and high-cost areas), subject to specified exemptions. (Sec. 212) Modifies requirements regarding interconnection and rural telephone companies. (Sec. 213) Imposes on facilities-based IP-enabled voice service providers the same rights, duties, and obligations as a requesting telecommunications carrier if the provider elects to assert those rights. Prohibits a carrier from refusing to transport or terminate IP-enabled voice traffic solely because it is IP-enabled and prohibits a provider originating, transmitting, or terminating IP-enabled voice traffic from being exempted from paying compensation for interstate traffic solely because the traffic is IP-enabled. Regulates IP-enabled voice service regarding: (1) accessibility for the disabled community; and (2) alarm or security systems or personal security or medical monitoring systems. (Sec. 214) Applies universal service provisions to any services under FCC jurisdiction that can effectively substitute for interexchange telecommunications services, including any such substitute classified as an information service that uses telecommunications. Subtitle B: Distributions From Universal Service - (Sec. 251) Requires biennial reports from eligible communications carriers concerning households offered and subscribing to broadband service in each of its service areas, as well as service plans and technologies. (Sec. 252) Establishes the Broadband for Unserved Areas Program to provide financial assistance for the deployment of broadband equipment and infrastructure to unserved areas throughout the United States. (Sec. 253) Declares that universal service support mechanisms and rules should be competitively neutral in terms of providers and technologies. (Sec. 255) Imposes additional requirements in order for a telecommunications carrier, after enactment of this title, to be eligible to receive universal service support. (Sec. 256) Prohibits the FCC from limiting the distribution and use of federal universal service support to a single connection or primary line. Makes all residential and business lines served by an eligible communications carrier eligible for such support. (Sec. 257) Requires telecommunications and IP-enabled voice service providers to ensure, as technically possible, that all traffic contains or preserves identification information. (Sec. 258) Mandates remedial action as the FCC deems necessary, including fines, for improper use of universal service support. (Sec. 259) Makes a vendor that has been convicted of criminal fraud connected to specified portions of universal service provisions ineligible to provide goods or services to any entity under those portions. (Sec. 260) Requires a telecommunications carrier to provide services, including infrastructure deployment, to rural health care providers at rates comparable to urban rates. (Sec. 261) Makes certain entities ineligible for preferential rates or treatment, including for-profit businesses, schools with endowments over a specified level, and some libraries. (Sec. 262) Mandates a predictable and sufficient support mechanism for eligible carriers in insular areas. Title III: Streamlining the Franchising Process - Video Competition and Savings for Consumers Act of 2006 - Subtitle A: Updating the 1934 Act and Leveling the Regulatory Playing Field - (Sec. 312) Requires a franchising authority to grant a franchise to provide video service to a video service provider within a specified time after receiving a complete application, subject to exception, and deems the application granted if the time limit is exceeded. Prohibits state and local governments from regulating direct broadcast satellite services, except for taxation of direct-to-home service. (Sec. 313) Requires the FCC to promulgate a standard franchise application form and regulates the form's contents.
