Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a program assessing formerly used defense sites that are known or suspected to contain such substances; (2) establish a program for the research, development, testing, and evaluation of unexploded ordnance detection instrument technology; (3) establish a program manager for DOD policy and budgeting issues involving the characterization, remediation, research, and management of military munitions response at defense sites; (4) develop an inventory of defense sites known or suspected to contain such substances; (5) establish and maintain a database of incidents and accidents involving unexploded ordnance or discarded military munitions; and (5) report to Congress on DOD strategy to complete environmental remediation of all military installations approved for closure or realignment. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct studies assessing the: (1) adequacy of the funding, staffing, and organization of the Military Munitions Response Program; and (2) effectiveness of current procedures and institutions for the management and transfer of former defense land. Expresses the sense of Congress with respect to military procurement and use of munitions."
