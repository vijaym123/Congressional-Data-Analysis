National Science Foundation Scholars Program Act - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to provide competitive scholarships to students in undergraduate science, engineering, technology, or mathematics programs. Requires the Director to award annual $5,000 grants to institutions of higher education attended by at least 10 such scholarship recipients to develop programs which provide: (1) such recipients with interaction, on a monthly basis, with speakers in the science, engineering, technology, or mathematics disciplines who work in business, industry, elementary or secondary education, museums, or other informal educational settings; (2) annual poster sessions through which recipients present their research efforts; (3) outreach to middle and high school students; and (4) recipient mentoring. Requires the Director to establish a website where current, former, and potential scholarship recipients can share ideas, present work, and learn of research opportunities.</summary>
