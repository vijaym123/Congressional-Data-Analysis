    "text": "Wired for Health Care Quality Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish the Office of the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology to develop a nationwide interoperable health information technology infrastructure. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) establish the public-private American Health Information Collaborative to recommend uniform national policies to support the widespread adoption of health information technology; and (2) provide for adoption by the federal government of any appropriate recommended standards. Prohibits any federal agency from expending federal funds to purchase any new health information technology that is inconsistent with adopted standards. Requires all federal agencies collecting health data to comply with such standards. Allows the Secretary to award grants for qualified health information technology systems, regional or local health information plans, and academic curricula integrating qualified health information technology systems in the clinical education of health professionals. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop measures for the quality of patient care; (2) disseminate recommendations and best practices derived from the analysis of quality measures; and (3) study methods to create efficient reimbursement incentives for improving health care quality. Requires the Comptroller General to report on the necessity and workability of requiring that patients be notified if their individually identifiable health information is wrongfully disclosed. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ), to develop a Health Information Technology Resource Center. Reauthorizes appropriations for grants to reduce statutory and regulatory barriers to telemedicine."
