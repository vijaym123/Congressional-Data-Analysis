    "text": "Insurance Competitive Pricing Act of 2005 - Amends the McCarran-Ferguson Act to eliminate the antitrust exemption applicable to the business of insurance where the conduct involves: (1) price fixing; (2) allocating with a competitor a geographical area in which, or persons to whom, insurance will be offered for sale; (3) unlawfully tying the sale or purchase of one type of insurance to the sale or purchase of another type of insurance or any other service or product; or (4) monopolizing, or attempting to monopolize, any part of such business. Retains such exemption for conduct involving the making of a contract, or engaging in a combination or conspiracy, to: (1) collect or disseminate historical loss data; (2) determine a loss development factor applicable to such data; (3) perform actuarial services if such contract, combination, or conspiracy does not involve restraint of trade; or (4) determine a trend factor (an adjustment to reflect a change in inflation or any other change in the estimated loss costs incurred by certain persons engaged in the business of insurance) during a specified transition period."
