Veterans' Memorials, Boy Scouts, Public Seals, and Other Public Expressions of Religion Protection Act of 2006 - Amends the Revised Statutes of the United States to limit the remedy, in a civil action against a state or local official for deprivation of civil rights, to injunctive and declaratory relief and deny attorneys' fees where the deprivation consists of a violation of a prohibition in the Constitution against the establishment of religion, including violations relating to: (1) religious words or imagery in veterans' memorials, public buildings, or official seals of states or their subdivisions; and (2) the chartering of Boy Scout units by states or their subdivisions and the Boy Scouts' using public buildings. Imposes the same limits regarding such an action against the United States or any U.S. agency or official acting in his or her official capacity.</summary>
