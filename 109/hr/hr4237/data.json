Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize the President, acting through the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to provide an eligible local government with financial assistance to enable it to pay all or part of the expenses necessary to pay its local public employees. Allows the Director to provide such assistance for up to six months, or longer if the local government is unable to generate enough revenue to pay such expenses. Requires a local government, to be eligible to receive assistance under this Act, to be located in an emergency or major disaster area, and certify to the Director that it is unable to generate enough revenue to pay its local public employees."
