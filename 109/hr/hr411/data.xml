  <summary>1/26/2005--Introduced.
Cattleman's Bill of Rights Act - Directs the National Park Service, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Bureau of Land Management (the Federal land management agency), whenever a land exchange, special-use land designation, or a biological opinion issued pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 involving Federal land under the agency's jurisdiction results in the elimination or reduction in permitted grazing animal unit months, to: (1) make available alternative, suitable, functionally equivalent forage to the holder of the grazing permit or lease eliminated or subject to the reduction; or (2) compensate the holder of the grazing permit or lease for the value of the permit or lease lost, when alternative forage is not available. Requires a Federal land management agency to allow the holder of a grazing permit or lease issued by the agency to sublease all or any part of the Federal land allotment covered by the permit or lease, without any fee or charge imposed by the agency, when the sublease will: (1) promote more sustainable use of forage within an area; (2) support ranchers who may be facing economic distress; or (3) promote other objectives identified by the agency. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop, implement, and update a training course for employees of the Federal land management agencies regarding the historical uses of the Federal land managed by such employees. Requires range managers to attend such course.</summary>
