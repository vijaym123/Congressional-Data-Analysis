Requires a Federal land management agency to allow the holder of a grazing permit or lease issued by the agency to sublease all or any part of the Federal land allotment covered by the permit or lease, without any fee or charge imposed by the agency, when the sublease will: (1) promote more sustainable use of forage within an area; (2) support ranchers who may be facing economic distress; or (3) promote other objectives identified by the agency. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop, implement, and update a training course for employees of the Federal land management agencies regarding the historical uses of the Federal land managed by such employees. Requires range managers to attend such course."
