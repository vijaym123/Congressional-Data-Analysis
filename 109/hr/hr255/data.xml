Commercial Alien Smuggling Elimination Act of 2005 or the CASE Act of 2005 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish within the S visa nonimmigrant classification (criminal or terrorist law enforcement assistance) a category for an alien: (1) who has reliable information about a commercial alien smuggling enterprise; (2) who is willing to supply or has supplied such information to a Federal or State court; and (3) whose presence in the United States is essential to such investigation. Authorizes: (1) up to 400 annual entrants; and (2) status adjustment to permanent resident. Authorizes measures as necessary to protect such individuals and their families. Authorizes increased criminal penalties for a person illegally bringing in and harboring aliens into the United States if: (1) part of a commercial enterprise; and (2) the aliens were transported in groups of ten or more, and in a manner that endangered their lives or presented a U.S. health risk. Establishes in the Department of Homeland Security a rewards program to help eliminate such enterprises. (States that Federal, State, local, or foreign officers or employees performing their official duties shall be ineligible for such rewards.) Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to implement a related public outreach program.</summary>
