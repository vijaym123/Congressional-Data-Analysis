  <summary>2/16/2006--Introduced.
Amends the federal judicial code to provide that no court created by Act of Congress shall have any jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court shall have no appellate jurisdiction, to hear or decide any question pertaining to the interpretation or the validity, under the Constitution, of the content of speech of any member of a state legislative body or any individual invited to speak before that body, when such speech occurs during the legislative session. Declares that any person who is a member of a state legislative body, or who is invited to speak before that body, other than as a witness, shall be immune from suit in any federal court, and shall not be held liable under any federal law, on account of the content of speech occurring during the legislative session, unless such speech constitutes treason, breach of peace, or an admission of guilt of a crime. Prohibits the use of federal funds to enforce any court order relating to the content of speech occurring during the legislative session of a state legislative body, with the same exceptions. Prohibits a federal court from imposing a fine on any state, state legislative body, member of a state legislative body, or individual invited to speak before that body (other than as a witness), on account of the content of speech occurring during the legislative session, with the same exceptions.</summary>
