    "text": "Human Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit: (1) conducting or attempting to conduct human cloning; (2) shipping the product of nuclear transplantation in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of human cloning in the United States or elsewhere; or (3) exporting to a foreign country an unfertilized blastocyst if such country does not prohibit human cloning. Sets forth criminal and civil penalties for violations. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the relevant congressional committees on: (1) actions taken to enforce such prohibitions; (2) coordination of Federal, State, and local enforcement; and (3) international laws relating to human cloning. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require research involving nuclear transplantation to be conducted in accordance with applicable Federal regulations regarding the protection of human subjects and Institutional Review Boards. Prohibits: (1) a somatic cell nucleus from being transplanted into a human oocyte (egg) that has undergone or will undergo fertilization; (2) an unfertilized blastocyst from being maintained after more than 14 days from its first cell division, not counting storage times at temperatures less than zero degrees centigrade; (3) an oocyte from being used in nuclear transplantation research unless donated voluntarily with the donor's informed consent; (4) a human oocyte or unfertilized blastocyst from being acquired, received, or transferred for valuable consideration in interstate commerce; and (5) nuclear transplantation in a laboratory in which human oocytes are subject to assisted reproductive technology treatments or procedures. Sets forth civil penalties for violations."
