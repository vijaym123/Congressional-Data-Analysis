  <summary>2/8/2006--Introduced.
Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make available to a state federal financial participation with respect to costs, including administrative costs, incurred by the state on or after January 1, 2006: (1) for medical assistance for covered part D drugs for full-benefit dual eligible individuals enrolled under a prescription drug plan under part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (SSA), or a Medicare Advantage-Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plan under SSA title XVIII part C (Medicare+Choice Program), but who were not reasonably able to access on a timely basis any prescription drug benefits to which they were entitled under such part; and (2) which the state reasonably expected would have been covered under such part. Directs the Secretary to provide for the recovery of the amount of federal financial participation made available to states from part D and MA-PD plans if the Secretary determines that such plans should have incurred such costs.</summary>
