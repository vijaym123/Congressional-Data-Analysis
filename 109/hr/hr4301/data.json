    "text": "Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal Land Conveyance Act of 2006 - Deauthorizes the Blunt Reservoir feature of the Oahe Unit, James Division, authorized as part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program. Allows preferential leaseholders of parcels of the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal features an option to purchase the land they lease from the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, or the Commission of Schools and Public Lands of South Dakota. Prescribes terms for such purchases, the option exercise period, and the basis for parcel valuation. Directs the Secretary to convey all preferential lease parcels not purchased by the leaseholder and the nonpreferential leased parcels and unleased parcels of the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks, to be used for mitigating the wildlife habitat that was lost as a result of the development of the Pick-Sloan project. Authorizes: (1) the state of South Dakota to accept certain conditions of conveyance, including that it receives the land conveyed in \"as is\" condition and accepts liability accruing as a result of ownership, operation, and maintenance of the features; and (2) the Commission, with the Department's concurrence, to allow a person to exchange other land in South Dakota for a nonpreferential lease parcel or unleased parcel at Blunt Reservoir or Pierre Canal. Directs the Secretary to transfer all archeological and cultural resource items collected from the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal Features to the South Dakota State Historical Society. Authorizes appropriations."
