    "text": "Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 - Title I: Combatting International Trafficking in Persons - (Sec. 101) Amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (Act) to direct The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of State (Department), and the Department of Defense (DOD) to incorporate anti-trafficking and protection measures for vulnerable populations, particularly women and children, into their post-conflict and humanitarian emergency assistance and program activities. Directs the Secretary of State (Secretary) and the Administrator of USAID to conduct a study and report regarding the threat and practice of trafficking in persons (trafficking) generated by post-conflict and humanitarian emergencies in foreign countries.

Directs the Secretary, prior to voting for a peacekeeping mission, to notify the appropriate committees respecting measures taken to prevent peacekeeping personnel from involvement in trafficking or sexual exploitation. (Sec. 105) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Director of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking of the Department should intensify the Office's focus on forced labor: (1) in countries that do not comply with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; and (2) other countries in which forced labor continues to be a serious human rights concern. Directs the Secretary of Labor, through the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, to carry out additional activities to monitor and combat forced labor and child labor in foreign countries, including: (1) developing a public list of goods believed to be produced by forced labor or child labor in violation of international standards; and (2) ensuring that such products are not imported into the United States. Title II: Combatting Domestic Trafficking in Persons - (Sec. 201) Directs the Attorney General to: (1) use state, local, and research data to carry out a biennial research and statistical review and analysis of severe forms of trafficking and of sex trafficking and unlawful commercial sex acts in the United States; and (2) conduct an annual conference in each of FY2006-FY2008, and thereafter conduct a biennial conference, addressing severe forms of trafficking and commercial sex acts in the United States. Authorizes FY2006-FY2007 appropriations. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants (75% maximum federal share) to states, Indian tribes, local government, and nonprofit, nongovernmental victims' service organizations to establish or expand assistance programs for U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens who are the subject of sex trafficking or severe forms of trafficking that occurs in the United States.

Authorizes FY2006-FY2007 appropriations. (Sec. 205) Requires reports respecting the amount, recipient, and purpose of each grant under sections 202 and 204 of this Act. (Sec. 206) Requires each federal department or agency involved in grant activities related to combatting trafficking or providing services to persons subjected to trafficking inside the United States to apprise the Senior Policy Operating Group of such activities in order to ensure consistency with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.
