Jeremy Bell Act of 2006 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit an employer from transferring an employee to another state if the employer knows that such employee engaged in sexual conduct with a minor. Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to five years for violations. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require private or public schools and educational agencies to adopt policies to ensure that all school or agency employees undergo a fingerprint-based check of the national crime information databases and, where possible, a fingerprint-based check of state criminal history databases.</summary>
