    "text": "United States Toxic Mold Safety and Protection Act of 2005 or the Melina Bill - Directs: (1) the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to jointly study the health effects of indoor mold growth and toxic mold; (2) EPA to promulgate standards for preventing, detecting, and remediating indoor mold growth; and (3) EPA, NIH, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to sponsor related public education programs. Directs: (1) rental property lessors to conduct annual indoor mold inspections and notify the occupants of such results; and (2) HUD and EPA to promulgate mold hazard disclosure regulations. Directs the Secretary of HUD to: (1) establish, with respect to indoor mold in public housing, inspection requirements for existing housing and construction standards for new housing; and (2) establish model construction standards and techniques for mold prevention in new buildings. Establishes an indoor/toxic mold inspection requirement with respect to federally made or insured mortgages. Amends the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 to provide for industry standards development for building products that are designed to retard mold development. Directs EPA to make grants to States and local governments for mold growth remediation efforts in buildings owned or leased by such governments, including schools and multifamily dwellings. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an annual tax credit for 60 percent of non-reimbursed mold inspection and remediation expenses ($50,000 annual maximum) paid or incurred by a taxpayer. Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to: (1) establish a toxic mold insurance program, with priority for one-to-four-family residential properties; and (2) establish in the Treasury a National Toxic Mold Hazard Insurance Fund. Authorizes the Director to assist qualifying insurers to form a federally-assisted toxic mold hazard insurance pool. Provides for Federal operation of such program under specified circumstances.Authorizes State waiver of income, resource, and other Medicaid requirements for an individual whose health has been adversely affected by toxic mold exposure, and who lacks adequate medical insurance coverage."
