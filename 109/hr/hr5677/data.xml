  <summary>6/22/2006--Introduced.
Ethics and Lobbying Reform Act of 2006 - Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA) to include among lobbying activities any paid efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying, but not grassroots lobbying itself. Amends Rule XXV (Limitations on Outside Earned Income and Acceptance of Gifts) of the Rules of the House and Rule XXXV (Gifts) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to exempt from the restrictions on gifts to Members of Congress, Senators, and House and Senate officers and employees the fair market value for a flight on an aircraft not licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate for compensation or hire. Requires public disclosure of such flights. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to exclude from the definition of contribution any travel expense for a flight on such aircraft, but only if it is paid for within seven days under specified conditions. Amends Rule XXV to repeal the permission for Members of the House to accept gifts of a nominal value. Deems a gift any payments or disbursements for an event in honor of a Member, officer, or employee that is held at a national party convention. Amends the Rules of the House to consider as gifts reimbursements to Members, officers, and employees for official travel-related expenses from nongovernmental organizations that retain or employ registered lobbyists or agents of a foreign principal. Prohibits such individuals from accepting transportation or lodging on trips arranged or financed by a lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal, or in which a lobbyist participates. Sets forth reporting requirements for lobbyist campaign contributions. Amends the federal criminal code to impose a two-year moratorium on lobbying of Congress by former Members, officers, or employees. Establishes within the legislative branch the Office of Public Integrity.</summary>
