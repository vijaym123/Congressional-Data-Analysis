    "text": "Independent Health Record Bank Act of 2006 - Requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to prescribe standards for the establishment and certification of independent health record banks to store individual electronic health records. Gives an individual ownership over his/her entire health record with the right to review its contents at any time during normal business hours. Allows a bank to generate revenue through the sale of nonidentifiable and partially identifiable health information contained in the bank for research purposes, but requires that such revenue be shared with account holders and allows such revenue to be shared with health care providers and payers. Excludes any such revenue from the gross income of the bank, account holder, or health care provider or payer. Requires prior authorization by an individual before access can be given to his/her electronic health record. Permits access to a limited, authenticated information set concerning an individual for emergency response purposes without the individual's prior consent. Requires the Board of Governors, acting through the Under Secretary for Technology or other appropriate official, to: (1) develop a program to certify entities to operate independent health record banks; and (2) establish an interagency council to develop standards for federal security auditing for entities operating banks. Imposes fines and/or imprisonment for the wrongful disclosure of information collected, maintained, or made available by a record bank. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax deduction for the cost paid by a taxpayer to maintain an independent health record bank account."
