Requires Federal agencies with significant regulatory or law enforcement responsibilities over cargo theft, as designated by the Attorney General, to modify their databases to ensure the collection and retrievability of data relating to crime and terrorism and related activities affecting cargo transportation. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish an outreach program to work with State and local law enforcement officials to harmonize the reporting of data on cargo theft; and (2) disseminate cargo theft information to appropriate law enforcement officials. Limits disclosure of reports and data under the Freedom of Information Act. Expands the scope of prohibitions against: (1) interstate or foreign shipments by carrier to include trailers and air cargo containers; and (2) the transportation and sale of stolen vehicles to include vessels."
