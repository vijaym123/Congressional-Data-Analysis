Authorizes a faculty member of a military service academy (including the Coast Guard Academy and Merchant Marine Academy) or Department of Defense professional school (including the National Defense University) to secure Federal copyright protection for a scholarly work prepared as part of that person's official duties, but only for purposes of submitting such work for publication in a scholarly journal, publication, or other edited work for which such a copyright is required. Requires the faculty member to transfer such copyright to the owner or publisher of the medium for which the work will be published. Prohibits the acceptance of royalties or other compensation by reason of such copyright protection.</summary>
