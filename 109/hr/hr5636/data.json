Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to eliminate the Social Security account number from Medicare, Medicaid (SSA title XIX), and SCHIP (SSA title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance) identification cards. Amends federal veterans' benefits law to eliminate the Social Security account number from veterans health care identification cards issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Expresses the sense of Congress that health insurers should not use Social Security account numbers on insurance identification or claims cards issued to beneficiaries, but should substitute another identification code or number instead."
