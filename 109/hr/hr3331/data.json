    "text": "Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to direct the National Science Foundation to make grants to institutions of higher education to establish precompetitive technology transfer centers. Authorizes specified activities at such centers to advance discoveries or inventions, which have been made in such institutions' laboratories and have market potential, to the point where they can attract funding from other private or public sources for commercially viable research. Sets forth required preferences in grantee selection. Requires equal access to be given to historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions."
