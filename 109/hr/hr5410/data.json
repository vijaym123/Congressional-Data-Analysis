Prescribes a procedure for the first elections under this Act. Entitles the District to one Representative until the taking effect of the next reapportionment. Increases the permanent membership of the House by one seat for future reapportionment of Representatives. Entitles the District, upon reapportionment, to as many seats in the House as a similarly populous state would be entitled to under the law. Amends the District of Columbia Election Code of 1955 to provide for elections for House Members and Senators from the District in lieu of a Delegate. Repeals provisions of the: (1) District of Columbia Delegate Act establishing the office of District of Columbia Delegate to the House; and (2) District of Columbia Statehood Constitution Convention Initiative of 1979 providing for electing a Senator and Representative for the District."
