  <summary>3/8/2005--Introduced.
Authorizes the President to extend unconditional and permanent nondiscriminatory (permanent normal trade relations) treatment to the products of the Ukraine. Declares congressional findings that the 1992 trade agreement between the United States and Ukraine remains in force between the two countries and provides the United States with important rights, including the right to use specific safeguard rules to respond to import surges from Ukraine, recognizing that these rights may terminate upon Ukraine's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Sets forth procedures with respect to: (1) notification by the President to Congress regarding U.S. entry into a bilateral agreement with Ukraine on the terms of accession by Ukraine to the WTO; (2) a congressional oversight resolution regarding such agreement; and (3) procedures for consideration of the resolution.</summary>
