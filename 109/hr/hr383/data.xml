  <summary>9/25/2006--Passed House amended.
Ice Age Floods National Geologic Route Designation Act of 2006 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service (NPS), and with the concurrence of the agency having jurisdiction over such roads, to designate a vehicular tour route from Missoula, Montana, to the Pacific Ocean along existing public roads linking certain nationally significant natural and cultural sites associated with the Ice Age Floods, which shall be known as the "Ice Age Floods National Geologic Route." Requires the Secretary to prepare and transmit to specified congressional committees a description of sites along the Route and a general plan, which shall include the location and description of unique geographic or geologic features and significant landforms and important cultural resources. Requires the general plan to include proposals for a comprehensive interpretive program of the Route. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the NPS Director, to administer a program for interpretation of the Route. Authorizes the Secretary to provide other federal, state, tribal, and local nonprofit or private entities with technical assistance in developing interpretive devices and materials with respect to sites linked by segments of the Route administered by such entities. Instructs the Secretary to ensure that the Route is marked with appropriate signs and other markers to guide the public. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to require any private property owner to allow public access (including federal, state, or local government access) to such private property, or to modify any provision of federal, state, or local law with regard to public access to or use of private lands. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
