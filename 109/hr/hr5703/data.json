Defines \"qualified flexible fuel vehicle\" to include a vehicle using fuel with an 85% ethanol content. Establishes in the Treasury the Alternative Fueling Infrastructure Trust Fund to create a grant program for the construction and operation of alternative fuel refueling stations. Defines \"alternative fuels\" to mean: (1) fuels with an 85% ethanol content, liquefied petroleum gas, or hydrogen; or (2) biodiesel mixtures.
