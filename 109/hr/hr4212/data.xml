Advancing FASD Research, Prevention, and Services Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a research agenda for the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and facilitate surveillance and prevention of such disorders. Requires the Secretary to award grants for individuals with FASD, including to: (1) establish programs of surveillance, prevention, and treatment for such individuals; (2) identify best practices for educating affected children, educating officials in the criminal justice system on coping with such individuals, and educating adoption or foster care agency officials about services for children with FASD; and (3) provide for transitional services for such individuals, for respite care for their caretakers, and for increased awareness and identification of FASD at community health centers. Requires: (1) the Secretary to provide for continuation of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; and (2) the Comptroller General to evaluate and make recommendations regarding appropriate federal FASD activities. Requires the Secretary to issue public service announcements to raise awareness of the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Requires the National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders to identify and describe the ten most important actions that must be taken to reduce prenatal alcohol exposure and all its adverse outcomes. Requires the Secretary of Education to direct the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services to take certain actions with regard to individuals with FASD, including implementing screening procedures and introducing curricula on how to educate children with such disorders. Requires the Attorney General to direct the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to take certain actions with regard to individuals with FASD, including educating officials on how to treat such individuals, studying the inadequacies of the current system for dealing with such individuals, and developing transition programs for such individuals who are released from incarceration.</summary>
