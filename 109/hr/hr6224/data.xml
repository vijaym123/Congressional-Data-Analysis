  <summary>9/27/2006--Introduced.
Underage Drinking Prevention Act of 2006 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to evaluate federal programs intended to prevent and reduce the consumption of beverage alcohol by minors. Directs that a program not receiving a score that demonstrates effectiveness must be modified to be eligible for future funding. Allows the Secretary to make grants to states for activities to prevent and reduce underage drinking by reallocating funds from ineffective grants and programs. Sets forth eligibility requirements, including that the state has: (1) demonstrated coordination among agencies to prevent and reduce underage drinking and abuse; (2) implemented a comprehensive plan to improve enforcement and adjudication of existing underage drinking laws; and (3) penalties for specified underage drinking offenses that escalate with repeat offenses. Allows the Secretary to terminate ineffective programs and transfer the federal amounts involved for use for: (1) programs determined to be effective; (2) evidence-based programs; and (3) incentive grants for state measures. Requires the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking to require that federally funded surveys collect and report data in a consistent manner that allows users to compare survey results. Sets forth age categories to be used in such surveys.</summary>
