Includes consideration of any professional development being pursued, in determining such qualifications for elementary, middle, or secondary school teachers who are not new to the profession.Provides for rural school districts: (1) an extension of a deadline for having highly qualified teachers; and (2) an authorization of additional appropriations for grants for teacher recruitment, retention, and professional development.Revises requirements for qualified teachers under ESEA title I part A (I-A) programs for disadvantaged students to: (1) apply only to teachers of core subjects; and (2) eliminate reference to the proportion of inexperienced teachers.Requires all ESEA grantees, whether under I-A or not, to meet specified qualification deadlines for all teachers of core subjects whom they employ."
