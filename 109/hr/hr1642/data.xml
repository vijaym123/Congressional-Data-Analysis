  <summary>4/14/2005--Introduced.
Obligation of Funds Transparency Act of 2005 - Prohibits a Federal agency from obligating funds made available in an appropriation Act to implement an earmark that is included in a congressional report accompanying such Act, unless the earmark is also included in that Act. Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit waiver of the germaneness requirement for conference reports by a report by the Committee on Rules, unless approved by a vote of three-fifths of the Members voting, with a quorum being present. Limits debate on such a question to 20 minutes equally divided by a proponent and an opponent. States that the above also applies in the case of a special rule that waives all (or specified) points of order. Prohibits the Committee on Rules from reporting a rule or order waiving the above amendment to the rules.</summary>
