Directs the Tribes to convey title to the Dawson Ranch to the United States. Declares that all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the Ranch except any facilities constructed pursuant to this Act, are to be held in trust by the United States for the Tribes. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire by donation the improvements in fee. Permits the Secretary to construct a facility on the Ranch only after consulting with, soliciting advice from, and obtaining the agreement of, the Tribe, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, and the Northern Arapaho Tribe. States that: (1) facilities constructed with federal funds or funds donated to the United States shall be owned in fee by the United States; and (2) for purposes of the construction, maintenance, or demolition of improvements or facilities, federal funds shall be expended only on improvements or facilities that are owned in fee by the United States. Requires the Ranch to be administered in perpetuity by the Secretary as part of the Site only for historical, traditional, cultural, and other uses in accordance with the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site Establishment Act of 2000. Requires that, for purposes of administration, the Secretary shall have access to the Ranch, improvements, and facilities as necessary for the management of the Site in accordance with the Act. Instructs the Secretary to take such action as is necessary to ensure that the Ranch is used only in accordance with all such requirements for the administration of the Ranch. Amends the Act to allow the Secretary to acquire land and interests in land within the boundaries of the Site which are owned by the state of Colorado (including a political subdivision of that state) only by donation or exchange (currently, only by donation)."
