  <summary>4/26/2005--Introduced.
Medicare Payment Adjustment To Community Health Centers (PATCH) Act of 2005 - Amends part E (Miscellaneous) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to revise the definition of Federally qualified health center (FQHC) services to include certain services furnished by an FQHC for which payment may otherwise be made under Medicare if they were furnished by a health care provider or health care professional other than an FQHC. Repeals the limitation of such services to outpatients of an FQHC, extending them to all patients of an FQHC. Repeals the declaration that any reference to a rural health clinic is deemed a reference to an FQHC. Ensures FQHC reimbursement for patients of hospitals and critical access hospitals under the hospital prospective payment system.</summary>
