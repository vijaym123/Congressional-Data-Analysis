Repeals the limitation of such services to outpatients of an FQHC, extending them to all patients of an FQHC. Repeals the declaration that any reference to a rural health clinic is deemed a reference to an FQHC. Ensures FQHC reimbursement for patients of hospitals and critical access hospitals under the hospital prospective payment system."
