Hawaii Invasive Species Prevention Act - States that it is U.S. policy to fund and support coordinated programs and activities to prevent the introduction or spread of invasive species and diseases in Hawaii. Prohibits a federal agency from carrying out any action that would likely cause or promote the introduction or spread of invasive species and diseases in Hawaii. Directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to: (1) impose a quarantine on Hawaii to prevent the introduction of invasive species and diseases in Hawaii; (2) establish a system of post-arrival quarantine protocols for all persons, baggage, cargo, containers, packing materials, and other items traveling or being shipped to Hawaii from domestic and foreign locations; and (3) establish an expedited process for Hawaii to seek the Secretaries' approval to impose additional prohibitions or restrictions on the introduction or movement of invasive species or diseases. Authorizes Hawaii to impose additional emergency prohibitions or restrictions for up to two years pending such approval.</summary>
