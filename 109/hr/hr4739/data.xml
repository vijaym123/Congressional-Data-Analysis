Entitles an eligible exposed employee, or the eligible survivor of such employee, to $100,000 compensation. Defines an "exposed employee" as an individual who: (1) was a civilian employee of the federal government, an employee of a contractor, or subcontractor at any tier of the Department of Defense; (2) was an employee present in the Republic of Vietnam or in or near the Korean demilitarized zone during the period beginning September 1, 1976, and ending on August 31, 1971; and (3) suffered injury or death by reason of an Agent Orange illness. Defines "eligible survivors" as the surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, all surviving children of the employee who had not yet attained the age of 18 when the employee died or was permanently disabled. Offsets a payment of any compensation made under this Act by any claim paid on the basis of the same illness or death due to exposure to Agent Orange herbicides.</summary>
