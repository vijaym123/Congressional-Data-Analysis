  <summary>7/27/2006--Introduced.
Stop Obesity in Schools Act of 2006 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a national strategy to reduce childhood obesity that: (1) provides for the reduction of childhood obesity rates by 10% by the year 2010; (2) addresses solutions to reducing the rates of childhood obesity; (3) identifies how the federal government can work effectively with entities to implement the strategy; and (4) includes measures to identify and overcome all obstacles to achieving the goal of reducing childhood obesity. Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to: (1) make grants to local educational agencies to reduce childhood obesity by adopting wellness policies and anti-obesity initiatives; (2) arrange for the evaluation of a wide variety of existing programs designed to prevent obesity in children and adolescents in order to identify factors contributing to program effectiveness; and (3) make grants on a competitive basis to state governments, local governments, and consortia of local governments to reduce childhood obesity through establishing or expanding healthy living and wellness coordinating councils and supporting regional workshops.</summary>
