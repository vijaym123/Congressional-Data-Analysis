Requires hearing disposition within two years of such determination, with an authorized extension if the person is determined to be a continuing threat to U.S. national security. Authorizes the President to establish tribunals for the trial of persons covered under this Act. Outlines procedural requirements. Requires an annual report from the Secretary of Defense to Congress on persons covered by this Act who are detained as unlawful combatants. Includes as covered by this Act a person who: (1) is accused of knowingly planning, authorizing, committing, aiding, or abetting one or more terrorist acts against the United States or being part of, or supporting, forces engaged in armed conflict against the United States; (2) is not a U.S. person or lawful permanent resident; and (3) is not a prisoner of war."
