  <summary>7/28/2005--Introduced.
Uzbekistan Freedom Promotion Act of 2005 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit assistance, with specified exceptions, to the government of Uzbekistan unless the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the government of Uzbekistan: (1) is cooperating with an independent international inquiry into the Andijan violence, has ceased pressuring the government of Kyrgyzstan to return the refugees who fled the massacre, and is prosecuting responsible individuals; and (2) has accelerated democratic reforms and fulfilled its human rights obligations. Prohibits visa issuance to any official of the government of Uzbekistan who is credibly alleged to have ordered, acquiesced to, or participated in human rights abuses or corruption unless the Secretary of State certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the visa issuance is in U.S. national security interests. Directs the President to: (1) freeze the financial assets and other economic resources in the United States of any official (or family member) of the government of Uzbekistan who is credibly alleged to have ordered, acquiesced to, or participated in human rights abuses, including the massacre in Andijan. (Permits lifting of such freeze if the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the official or individual has been properly investigated and cleared of any wrongdoing.); (2) prohibit munitions or dual use exports to Uzbekistan unless the President certifies that the government of Uzbekistan has met the requirements of the first paragraph above; (3) expedite U.S. admission of any Uzbekistan national who is under threat of severe penalty as a result of participating in pro-democracy activities, including Uzbekistan citizens who have fled to Kyrgyzstan; and (4) transmit to the appropriate congressional committees a plan to move all U.S. military operations from Uzbekistan.</summary>
