(Sec. 138) Instructs the Administrator of General Services to study and report to Congress on the advantages and disadvantages of employing intermittent escalators in the United States. (Sec. 139) Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on: (1) state and regional policies that promote cost-effective programs to reduce energy consumption by state-regulated utilities and nonregulated utilities; and (2) failure to comply with deadlines for new or revised energy conservation standards. (Sec. 140) Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program of financial assistance to between three and seven states to implement energy efficiency pilot projects. Subtitle D: Public Housing - (Sec. 151) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to include among the capital and management activities for which assistance may be made available to public housing agencies from the Public Housing Capital Fund, the improvement of energy and water-use efficiency by certain energy and water conserving fixtures and fittings, and integrated utility management and capital planning to maximize energy conservation and efficiency measures. (Sec. 152) Requires a public housing agency to purchase energy-efficient appliances designated as Energy Star products or FEMP products unless it is not cost-effective to do so. (Sec. 153) Amends the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act with respect to energy efficiency standards. (Sec. 154) Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to report to Congress on development and implementation of an integrated energy strategy to reduce utility expenses through cost-effective energy conservation and efficiency measures and energy efficient design and construction of public and assisted housing. Title II: Renewable Energy - Subtitle A: General Provisions - (Sec. 201) Instructs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) publish annual reports based upon assessments of renewable domestic energy resources, including solar, wind, biomass, ocean (tidal and thermal), geothermal, and hydroelectric energy; and (2) undertake new assessments as necessary, taking into account changes in market conditions, available technologies, and other relevant factors. (Sec. 202) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to revise requirements for incentive payments for renewable energy production facilities. Instructs the Secretary to assign 60% of appropriated funds for any given year to facilities that use solar, wind, geothermal, or closed-loop (dedicated energy crops) biomass technologies to generate electricity if there are insufficient appropriations to make full payments for electric production from all qualified renewable energy facilities. Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2026. (Sec. 203) Requires federal purchases of renewable energy to escalate in accordance with certain percentage guidelines.
