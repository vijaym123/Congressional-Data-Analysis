Prohibits the Secretary from using such amounts for biological monitoring for listed or candidate species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Requires at least 80% of the permit fees collected at a specific unit of the NFS to be expended for that unit and permits the Secretary to transfer up to 20% of such fees to appropriations available to enhance recreation opportunities at other NFS units."
