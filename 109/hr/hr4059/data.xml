  <summary>10/17/2005--Introduced.
Teacher Education for Autistic Children Act of 2005, or TEACH Act of 2005 - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to require assisted local educational agencies to report on autism early intervention activities and personnel training. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Education, in making certain IDEA grants or contracts, shall give special consideration to: (1) the increased incidence of autism spectrum disorders among children; and (2) the increased demands placed on educational systems due to the complexity and symptoms of autism. Directs the Secretary to: (1) carry out an expanded student loan forgiveness program for teachers of autistic children; and (2) establish a Task Force on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Requires the Secretary, in cooperation with a specified Department of Health and Human Services official, to: (1) award grants or contracts to develop an outreach plan for populations and individuals underserved by early screening and diagnosis for neurodevelopmental delays; and (2) report on services provided to individuals with ASD in accordance with IDEA and the Head Start Act.</summary>
