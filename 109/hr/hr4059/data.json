Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Education, in making certain IDEA grants or contracts, shall give special consideration to: (1) the increased incidence of autism spectrum disorders among children; and (2) the increased demands placed on educational systems due to the complexity and symptoms of autism. Directs the Secretary to: (1) carry out an expanded student loan forgiveness program for teachers of autistic children; and (2) establish a Task Force on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Requires the Secretary, in cooperation with a specified Department of Health and Human Services official, to: (1) award grants or contracts to develop an outreach plan for populations and individuals underserved by early screening and diagnosis for neurodevelopmental delays; and (2) report on services provided to individuals with ASD in accordance with IDEA and the Head Start Act."
