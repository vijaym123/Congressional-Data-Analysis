Provides for reasonable remuneration for the patent holder for use of the patent. Allows the Secretary to authorize the use of a patent, without the patent holder's authorization, to export medicines or other health care products that are needed to address global public health emergencies when the legitimate rights of the patent holder are protected in the export market. Authorizes the Secretary to immediately approve a new drug application upon request by a person authorized to manufacture the drug under this Act.</summary>
