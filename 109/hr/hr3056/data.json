Provides for coverage of part-time employees.Requires the Secretary to enter into contracts with health insurance issuers for the offering of such insurance coverage.Reduces by five percent the total premium otherwise payable by such employer if an average of fewer than 25 employees were employed during the preceding calendar year.Requires the Secretary to provide premium subsidies (calculated according to specified formulae) to: (1) employers for coverage of employees whose individual income is at or below 200 percent of the poverty line; as well as (2) such employees."
