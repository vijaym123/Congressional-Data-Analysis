  <summary>11/16/2005--Introduced.
Prohibits the interment or memorialization in a national or military cemetery of, or the performance of military funeral honors for, any person convicted of a federal or state capital crime for which a life sentence or the death penalty may be imposed. (Currently, such prohibition extends only to those so convicted who have been sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole.) Directs the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Defense to prescribe regulations to ensure that a person is not interred in a national or military cemetery or provided funeral honors unless a good faith effort has been made to determine whether such person is ineligible for such interment or honors. Directs the Secretary of the Army to remove the remains of Russell Wayne Wagner from Arlington National Cemetery.</summary>
