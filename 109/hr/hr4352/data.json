Directs the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Defense to prescribe regulations to ensure that a person is not interred in a national or military cemetery or provided funeral honors unless a good faith effort has been made to determine whether such person is ineligible for such interment or honors. Directs the Secretary of the Army to remove the remains of Russell Wayne Wagner from Arlington National Cemetery."
