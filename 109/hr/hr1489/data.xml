  <summary>4/6/2005--Introduced.
Coastal Ocean Observation System Integration and Implementation Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a Coastal Ocean Observation System (System) to support coastal and fishery management activities and an integrated national ocean observation system. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) designate as a unit of the System any Federal agency or non-Federal entity that operates marine sensors that collect observation data in U.S. ocean and coastal waters; and (2) coordinate such units' activities. Requires the Secretary to develop: (1) viable end-use products of the System to support coastal and fishery management activities; (2) a data management and communication system by which all System collected data regarding U.S. coastal waters are integrated and available; and (3) forecast models using collected data to support and improve coastal and fishery management, safe and efficient marine navigation, weather and climate prediction, and other appropriate activities. Requires the Secretary to carry out pilot projects to determine the effectiveness of collecting and integrating coastal ocean observation data to support the System.</summary>
