Directs the Under Secretary to ensure that funding and resources expended in international cooperative activities will be equitably matched by the foreign partner organization. Directs the Under Secretary to establish the Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Program to facilitate international cooperative activities throughout the Science and Technology Directorate. Provides that the Program shall be headed by a Director, who shall be responsible for developing mechanisms and legal frameworks to allow and to support international cooperative activities in support of homeland security research. Requires the Director to: (1) facilitate the matching of U.S. entities with non-U.S. entities that may partner in homeland security research activities; (2) ensure that activities are coordinated with those of other DHS components and other relevant research agencies; and (3) periodically support the planning and execution of international homeland security technology workshops and conferences. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary, to be derived from amounts otherwise authorized for the Directorate, for international cooperative activities for each of FY2007-FY2010. Requires the Under Secretary, acting through the Director, to report to Congress every five years on partnerships formed and international cooperative activities underway."
