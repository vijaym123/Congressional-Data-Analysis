  <summary>7/28/2005--Introduced.
Total Health Requires Improved Vaccination Efforts Act of 2005 or the THRIVE Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to expand the Center for Disease Control's adult immunization program by: (1) authorizing additional appropriations for activities to increase immunizations rates for adults; and (2) making grants to states for demonstrations projects to provide influenza immunizations to uninsured adults at high risk for influenza. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) develop and disseminate guidelines to ensure that immunizations are routinely offered to adults by health care providers; and (2) provide for an educational campaign on the importance of adult immunizations. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, to: (1) establish standards for adult influenza immunizations under the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (2) determine the feasibility and advisability of including such immunizations as a performance measure under program quality initiatives; and (3) establish standards for immunizations for influenza of health care workers. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), to study the best practices of health insurers and managed care organizations to encourage the use of adult immunizations for influenza by enrollees. Requires the Secretary to determine the feasibility and advisability of requiring compliance with recommendations for immunizations for all health care workers for provider accreditation. Prohibits a contract or plan under the federal employees health benefit program from being made or approved which does not offer and waive the deductible for pneumococcal and influenza immunization services to high risk adult enrollees.</summary>
