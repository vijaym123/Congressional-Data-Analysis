  <summary>4/8/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit a pharmacy from receiving a prescription in interstate commerce unless it: (1) ensures that a prescription that is not filled due to a refusal by a pharmacist on the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions is filled by another pharmacist employed by the pharmacy within four hours of such refusal; and (2) does not employ any pharmacist who refuses to return an unfilled prescription to the patient or transfer an unfilled prescription to another pharmacy with the intent to prevent a patient from filling a valid prescription for a drug. Sets forth penalties for violations. Allows a civil action against a pharmacy for a violation of this Act.</summary>
