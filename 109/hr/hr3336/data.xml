  <summary>7/19/2005--Introduced.
Safe Aviation and Flight Enhancement Act of 2005 - Amends federal transportation law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations requiring all commercial aircraft that must carry both a cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder to be equipped with a second recorder system that utilizes deployable combination cockpit voice and digital flight data recording technology. Requires the second deployable recorder system to be mounted as far rear on the airframe as practicable. Sets forth minimum deployable recorder capabilities. Directs the Secretary to: (1) purchase and make available, at no cost, to an air carrier such deployable recorder systems as may be necessary for it to comply with regulations; and (2) reimburse aircraft manufacturers owned or controlled by a U.S. citizen for engineering, certification, and installation costs incurred in developing and installing deployable recorder systems to comply with regulations.</summary>
