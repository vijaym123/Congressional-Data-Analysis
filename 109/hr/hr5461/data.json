    "text": "Meeting Authorization Requirements for the Coast Act of 2006 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to carry out specified projects for hurricane and storm damage reduction and flood control in Louisiana. Amends the Flood Control Act of 1948 to increase the amount that the Secretary may allot for flood control for a small flood control project at any single locality. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1992 to: (1) authorize the Secretary to carry out specified projects to transport and place, and to develop plans for regional management of, sediment obtained in conjunction with water management projects associated with flood damage reduction, hurricane and storm damage reduction, aquatic plant control, and environmental protection and restoration; and (2) permit to be carried out at federal expense specified projects to protect, restore, or create aquatic and ecologically-related habitat located in a disadvantaged community or projects located in coastal communities impacted by 2005 hurricanes. Modifies specified projects and requires or authorizes the Secretary to carry out specified studies, programs, and projects in Louisiana and Mississippi. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress: (1) reports recommending specified modifications to the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet, near-term ecosystem restoration measures for the Chenier Plain, Louisiana, and a framework for developing a long-term program to protect, conserve, and restore specified wetlands, estuaries, and barrier islands; and (2) a feasibility study recommending a comprehensive long-term plan for the coastal Louisiana ecosystem. Establishes the Coastal Louisiana Ecosystem Protection and Restoration Task Force to make recommendations to the Secretary to protect, conserve, and restore the coastal Louisiana ecosystem. Sets forth requirements regarding project costs, monitoring, audits, and justification."
