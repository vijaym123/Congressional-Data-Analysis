Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act to Meet Immediate Needs Arising From the Consequences of Hurricane Katrina, 2005 - Appropriates an additional: (1) $10 billion to the Department of Homeland Security for disaster relief (for areas affected by Hurricane Katrina), to remain available until expended; and (2) $500 million to the Department of Defense for ``Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide'' for emergency hurricane expenses, to support costs of evacuation, emergency repairs, deployment of personnel, and other costs resulting from immediate relief efforts, to remain available until September 30, 2006. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer these funds to appropriations for military personnel, operation and maintenance, procurement, family housing, Defense Health Program, and working capital funds. Requires transferred funds to be merged with and be available for the same purposes and for the same time period as the appropriation or fund to which transferred. Requires re-transfer back to this appropriation of any transferred funds determined to be not necessary for the purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary to notify the congressional defense committees in writing within five days after any such transfer. Designates as emergency requirements, which shall shall not count for certain purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the amounts appropriated by this Act.</summary>
