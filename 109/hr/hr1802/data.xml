  <summary>4/21/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 with respect to the requirement that an article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the United States be marked in a conspicuous place to indicate to an ultimate purchaser in the United States the English name of the article's country of origin. Excludes live bovine animals from the exception to such requirement (thus subjecting them to it). Requires each live bovine animal to be marked as to country of origin by means of branding or an equally permanent method of marking.</summary>
