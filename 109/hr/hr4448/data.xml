  <summary>12/6/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for the nonimmigrant U.S. entry of an alien on a tourist or business visa (B-visa) or student visa (F-visa) who: (1) is the spouse or child of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States; and (2) seeks admission for purposes of visiting the permanent resident spouse or parent or for studying in the United States. States that the fact that a petition has been filed on such nonimmigrant alien's behalf for classification as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence shall not constitute evidence of intention to abandon a foreign residence.</summary>
