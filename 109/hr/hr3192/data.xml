  <summary>6/30/2005--Introduced.
Paid Family and Medical Leave Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a Family and Medical Insurance Program, with benefits to be administered by each state (or by the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration in any state whose Governor requests this). Entitles eligible employees to Program benefits, including 55% of weekly basic earnings for 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period. Requires certification by health care providers of employees or of their eligible family or household members. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a tax on employers to finance a Family and Medical Leave Trust Fund in the Treasury to for Program benefits. Exempts from such tax employers with voluntary plans approved by the Secretary as equivalent or better than the Program. Allows self-employers to elect to pay such tax to receive Program benefits.</summary>
