Amends the National Housing Act to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to insure: (1) mortgages for new or substantially rehabilitated child care and development facilities; (2) loans to such facilities for fire safety equipment; and (2) mortgages executed in connection with the purchase or refinancing of existing child care facilities. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to Congress on the availability of secondary markets for such mortgages. Authorizes HUD grants to eligible nonprofit organizations for technical and financial assistance to assist eligible child care providers in acquiring or improving facilities or equipment."
