Requires states also to require voters to present photo identification in a federal election. Requires each state to establish a program to provide free photo identification to eligible voters in elections held in the state who do not otherwise possess a government-issued photo identification. Directs the Election Assistance Commission to make payments to states to cover costs of making such photo identifications available. Amends federal highway law to require the withholding of highway funds from any state not in compliance with the requirements of this Act."
