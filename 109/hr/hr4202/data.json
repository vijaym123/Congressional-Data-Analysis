    "text": "Reentry Enhancement Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to reauthorize, rewrite, and expand provisions regarding adult and juvenile offender reentry demonstration projects, including by authorizing funds for grants to establish or expand the use of reentry courts. Sets forth grant priorities and requirements, including that each state or local government recipient establish a Reentry Task Force or other relevant convening authority. Authorizes the Attorney General to make a grant to provide for the establishment of a National Adult and Juvenile Offender Reentry Resource Center. Establishes in the executive branch an interagency task force on federal programs related to former prisoner reentry into the community. Authorizes research on offender reentry. Declares that the right of a U.S. citizen to vote in any election for federal office shall not be denied or abridged because that individual has been convicted of a crime unless such individual is serving a felony sentence at the time. Requires the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends a reasonable part of the final portion of that term preparing for reentry. Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to states to: (1) develop, implement, or expand family-based drug treatment alternatives to prison programs for custodial parents who are convicted of nonviolent or drug-related felonies; and (2) provide jail-based substance abuse treatment programs in women's correctional facilities for female offenders with minor children. Provides for the establishment of certain aftercare treatment services for custodial parents with children under age 18."
