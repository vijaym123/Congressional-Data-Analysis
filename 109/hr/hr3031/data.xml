Corporate Advance Disclosure Act of 2005 - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require an issuer to provide at least 60 days advance notice to the Securities and Exchange Commission if it creates, substantially increases, or funds any non-qualified pension plan for which a director or executive officer is the beneficiary. Requires implementing SEC rules to require that the disclosure separately state each creation, increase, or funding with respect to each such director or officer.</summary>
