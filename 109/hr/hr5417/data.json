Requires a provider that prioritizes or offers enhanced quality of service to data of a particular type to prioritize or offer enhanced quality of service to all data of that type without imposing a surcharge or other consideration. Permits a provider to take reasonable and nondiscriminatory measures to: (1) manage the functioning of its network and services; (2) give priority to emergency communications; (3) prevent a violation of federal or state law; (4) offer consumer protection services; (5) offer special promotional pricing or other marketing initiatives; or (6) prioritize or offer enhanced quality of service to all data of a particular type without imposing a surcharge or other consideration."
