Prohibits a person from offering a security sensitive material for transportation by motor vehicle or causing the transportation of such material by motor vehicle, unless the operator of the motor vehicle holds a security sensitive material permit issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Requires the Secretary to conduct a fingerprint-based background records check before issuing a security sensitive material permit to an individual. Allows the Secretary to issue a security sensitive material permit to an individual as an integrated component of a transportation security card. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for persons who violate the requirements of this Act. Prohibits a motor vehicle registered in Mexico or Canada from transporting security sensitive material in U.S. commerce until the operator of the motor vehicle has undergone a similar background records check. Establishes task forces on: (1) highway security; (2) disqualifying crimes; and (3) redundant background checks."
