States that nothing in this Act: (1) entitles a person to a cause of action for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be demonstrated to be motivated by gender; or (2) requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction. Gives the Federal and State courts concurrent jurisdiction over actions brought pursuant to this Act. Directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to create and provide to employers materials regarding personnel policies and safety standards to assist them in avoiding liability under this Act."
