Requires the Secretary of the Interior to convey to Beaver County, Utah, for public recreational use all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the approximately 200 acres identified as "Minersville State Park." Permits the County to sell, for not less than fair market value, a part of the property conveyed to the County under this Act, if the proceeds of such sale are used by the County solely for maintenance of public recreation facilities located on the remainder of the conveyed property. Provides that, if the County does not comply with such requirements in the conveyance of such property: (1) the County shall pay to the United States the proceeds of the conveyance; and (2) the Secretary may require the reversion of all the property conveyed under this Act (other than property sold by the County under this Act).</summary>
