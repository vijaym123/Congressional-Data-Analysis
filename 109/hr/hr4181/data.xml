  <summary>10/28/2005--Introduced.
Rocky Flats Minerals Acquisition Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to purchase, at fair market value from willing sellers, rights to minerals located within the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. Withdraws such rights from disposal under federal mining and mineral leasing laws. Authorizes the Secretary to use certain funds appropriated for the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site during FY 2006 to purchase such rights. Cites purchase and payment conditions for satisfaction of any natural resource damage liability claim. Declares that administrative jurisdiction over lands in Rocky Flats where active development of mineral rights is occurring remains with the Secretary and shall not be transferred to the Secretary of the Interior until mining has been terminated and the lands have been reclaimed by the mineral rights holders in accordance with Colorado state requirements. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 to prescribe procedures under which the Secretary of the Interior may acquire mineral interests, including interests in sand and gravel and any other non-federal interests in lands or waters within Rocky Flats.</summary>
