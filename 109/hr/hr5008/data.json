    "text": "Nanoscience to Commercialization Institutes Act of 2006 - Authorizes the Under Secretary of Technology of the Department of Commerce to award grants to eligible entities to establish up to eight Nanoscience to Commercialization Institutes throughout the United States to assist in the commercialization of nanotechnology. Instructs the Under Secretary to ensure that each Institute is located at either a public university or federal laboratory. Requires grants awarded pursuant to this Act to be used to establish at least one Institute in each of the following areas of nanotechology or microtechnology: (1) energy; (2) printable electronics; (3) medical; (4) transportation; (5) textiles; and (6) agriculture. Specifies matching requirements for for-profit manufacturing companies conducting research and development in micro- and nanotechnologies. Makes any institution of higher education that has a federally funded nanotechnology center or that is the primary lead of a nanotechnology center not eligible for a grant under this Act. Directs the Under Secretary to establish a peer review committee to review the goals and progress made by each Institute. Requires each grant recipient to submit a report to such committee describing its Institute's accomplishments and goals as a condition of continued grant funding."
