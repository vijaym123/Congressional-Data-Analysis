    "text": "Common Sense Spending Act of 2005 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to extend discretionary spending limits through FY 2010. Repeals requirements for inclusion in a sequestration report of adjustments to discretionary limits for: (1) continuing disability reviews by the Social Security Administration; (2) specified allowances for the International Monetary Fund and international arrearages; (3) any earned income tax credit compliance initiative; (4) adoption incentive payments; and (5) conservation spending. Requires an adjustment to discretionary spending limits equal to the estimated resulting reduction in mandatory budget authority and outlays utilizing accrual methods, if enacted legislation charges Federal agencies for the full cost of accrued Federal retirement and health benefits, and an appropriations Act provides new budget authority to carry out such legislation. Revises PAYGO requirements to remove receipts from the requirement that any legislation enacted before FY 2011 affecting direct spending (currently, direct spending and receipts) that increases the deficit will trigger an offsetting sequestration. Revises the formula for calculating the amount of deficit increase or decrease by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Requires OMB to assume an automatic deficit increase of $8.4 billion before making such calculations for FY 2005. States that, with respect to eliminating a deficit increase, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline for FY 2006 and for FY 2007 through 2010 at the baseline after adjusting for any sequester in FY 2005. Revises the definition of baseline to exclude emergency appropriations and legislation. Prohibits such emergency appropriations from being extended in the baseline. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require that the committee report and any statement of managers accompanying proposed legislation analyze whether a proposed emergency requirement meets a specified definition of \"emergency.\" Prohibits the consideration of any such legislation that does not meet this \"emergency\" definition."
