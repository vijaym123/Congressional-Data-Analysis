Children's Safety Act of 2005 - Title I: Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act - Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act - Subtitle A: Jacob Wetterling Sex Offender Registration and Notification Program - (Sec. 111) Includes within the definition of a "sex offender" for purposes of this title an individual convicted of, or adjudicated a juvenile delinquent for, a serious sex offense or a specified offense (including a misdemeanor sex offense) against a minor. (Sec. 112) Requires each state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and each federally recognized Indian tribe to maintain a sex offender registry. (Sec. 113) Requires a sex offender to register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, is an employee, and is a student. Directs the offender to initially register: (1) before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement; or (2) not later than five days after being sentenced for that offense, if the offender is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Requires: (1) the offender to inform each jurisdiction involved within five days after each change of residence, employment, or student status; (2) the Attorney General to prescribe a method for the registration of sex offenders convicted before this Act's enactment or its effective date in a particular jurisdiction; and (3) each jurisdiction other than a federally recognized Indian tribe to provide a criminal penalty, including a maximum term of imprisonment that is greater than one year and a minimum term that is no less than 90 days, for the failure of an offender to comply with this title's requirements. (Sec. 114) Lists information that the offender must provide for inclusion in the registry, including name and aliases, Social Security number, residence, place of employment, place where the offender is a student, license plate number, photograph, fingerprints and palm prints, and DNA sample. Requires the jurisdiction to include a statement of the facts of the offense giving rise to the registration requirement, including whether the offender was prosecuted as a juvenile and the offender's criminal history. (Sec. 115) Requires an offender to keep the registration current: (1) for the life of the offender if the offense is a specified offense against a minor, a serious sex offense, or a second misdemeanor sex offense against a minor; and (2) for a 20-year period (excluding any time the offender is in custody or civilly committed) in any other case. (Sec. 116) Requires an offender to appear in person and verify the information in each registry at least every six months. (Sec. 117) Requires the appropriate official, shortly before release from custody of the offender (or if the offender is not in custody, immediately after sentencing), to: (1) inform and explain to the offender the duty to register; (2) require the offender to sign a form stating that the offender understands the registration requirement; and (3) ensure that the offender is registered. (Sec. 118) Establishes the Jessica Lunsford Address Verification program, under which an appropriate official shall verify the residence of each registered offender at least monthly (or in the case of an offender required to register because of a misdemeanor sex offense against a minor, at least quarterly). Allows such verification to be achieved by mailing a nonforwardable verification form to the offender's last known address, which the offender must return within a set period. (Sec. 119) Directs the Attorney General to maintain a national database (known as the National Sex Offender Registry) at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for each offender and for each other person required to register in a jurisdiction's registry. (Sec. 120) Establishes the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public website. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) maintain the website as a site on the Internet which allows the public to obtain relevant information for each offender by a single query; and (2) ensure that updated information about an offender is immediately transmitted by electronic forwarding to all relevant jurisdictions. (Sec. 121) Requires each jurisdiction to make available and readily accessible on the Internet all information about each offender in the registry, except for the offender's Social Security number, the victim's identity, and any other information exempted by the Attorney General. Makes an exception for information about an offender required to register for committing a misdemeanor sex offense against a minor who has attained age 16. (Sec. 122) Establishes the Megan Nicole Kanka and Alexandra Nicole Zapp Community Program, under which an appropriate jurisdiction official, within five days after an offender registers or updates a registration, shall provide information about that offender to: (1) the Attorney General for inclusion in the National Sex Offender Registry; (2) appropriate law enforcement agencies and each school and public housing agency in each area in which the individual resides, is employed, or is a student; (3) each jurisdiction from or to which a change of residence, work, or student status occurs; (4) any agency responsible for conducting employment-related background checks under the National Child Protection Act of 1993; (5) social service entities responsible for protecting minors in the child welfare system; and (6) volunteer organizations in which contact with minors or other vulnerable individuals might occur. (Sec. 123) Requires: (1) an appropriate official to notify the Attorney General and appropriate state and local law enforcement agencies of any failure by an offender to comply with registry requirements; and (2) those officials to take action to ensure compliance. (Sec. 124) Grants the jurisdictions and their entities and personnel immunity from liability for good faith conduct under this title. (Sec. 125) Directs the Attorney General to develop and support software for maintaining and sharing offender registries. (Sec. 126) Requires: (1) the Department of Justice (DOJ), if the Attorney General determines that a jurisdiction does not have a minimally sufficient sex offender registration program, to carry out the duties imposed on that jurisdiction by this title; and (2) each jurisdiction to implement this title within two years (authorizes a one-year extension). (Sec. 128) Directs that 10% of Byrne grants and Local Government Law Enforcement Block (LGLEB) grants be withheld from jurisdictions that fail to implement this title.

Directs the Attorney General to: (1) ensure that different approaches to monitoring are funded; and (2) report to Congress on the effectiveness and value of funded programs, the cost-effectiveness of the electronic monitoring to reduce sex offenses compared to other alternatives, and recommendations for continued funding. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 131) Makes a state that, within three years after enactment of this Act, has in effect laws and policies ensuring electronic monitoring of a person released after being convicted of a state sex offense in which the victim has not attained age 18 eligible for a bonus payment .

Directs that at least one of each program be established in each region within the Bureau. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 135) Directs the Attorney General to provide technical assistance to assist jurisdictions in the identification and location of offenders relocated as a result of Hurricane Katrina.

Subtitle B: Criminal Law Enforcement of Registration Requirements - (Sec. 151) Prescribes penalties to be imposed on any person who fails to register after receiving notice that he or she is required to register under this Act. Increases penalties under the fraud and false statements offense if the matter relates to specified offenses, such as sexual exploitation of children and trafficking for illegal sexual activity.

Title III: Prevention and Deterrence of Crimes Against Children Act of 2005 - Prevention and Deterrence of Crimes Against Children Act of 2005 - (Sec. 302) Rewrites federal criminal code provisions regarding penalties for crimes against children to require a person convicted of a federal crime of violence against an individual under age 18 to be sentenced to: (1) death or life imprisonment if the crime results in the death of a person under age 18; (2) life or at least 30 years' imprisonment if the crime is a kidnaping, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or maiming, or results in serious bodily injury; (3) life or at least 20 years' imprisonment if the crime results in bodily injury; (4) life or at least 15 years' imprisonment if a dangerous weapon was used during and in relation to the crime; and (5) life or at least ten years' imprisonment in any other case. (Sec. 303) Denies jurisdiction to consider: (1) claims relating to the judgment or sentence in an application for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court for a crime that involved the killing of a person under age 18; and (2) applications with respect to an error relating to the applicant's sentence or sentencing that has been found to be harmless or not prejudicial in state court proceedings, or that was found by a state court to be procedurally barred, unless a determination that the error is not structural is contrary to clearly established federal law, as determined by the U.S. Supreme Court. Sets timetables for proceedings. Extends certain rights associated with habeas corpus proceedings to victims of the state offense at issue. Makes this Act applicable to pending cases.

(Sec. 503) Directs the Attorney General, at the request of the chief executive officer of a state, to conduct fingerprint-based checks of the national crime information databases (and, where possible, state criminal history databases) for local child welfare agency background checks required under the Social Security Act on prospective foster or adoptive parents. Authorizes the Attorney General and the states to charge any applicable fees for such checks. Prohibits an individual from releasing information derived from such check other than to others legally authorized to receive that information.

Directs the Attorney General to make grants to jurisdictions for establishing, enhancing, or operating effective civil commitment programs for sexually dangerous persons. (Sec. 515) Permits an indictment to be found or an information instituted at any time without limitation for specified felony child abduction and sex offenses. (Sec. 516) Makes it a Class A (currently, Class B) misdemeanor for specified professionals to fail to report child abuse. (Sec. 517) Calls for background checks conducted as a precondition to approval of any foster or adoptive placement of children affected by a natural disaster or terrorist attack to be expedited to ensure that such children do not become subjected to the offenses enumerated in this Act. (Sec. 518) Requires jurisdictions to have in effect laws requiring the testing of defendants for HIV disease in cases in which the perpetrator, by force or threat of force, compels the victim to engage in sexual activity. Requires the withholding of 10% of funds under the Byrne and LGLEB grants programs from jurisdictions that fail to comply within two years. Title VI: Miscellaneous Provision - (Sec. 601) Prohibits the sale or other disposition of a firearm to, or possession of a firearm by, any person who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor sex offense against a minor.

Directs the Attorney General to establish register information dissemination standards to preserve the confidentiality of records while also ensuring that government entities have access to carry out their responsibilities to protect children. Title VIII: Child Pornography Prevention Act of 2005 - Child Pornography Prevention Act of 2005 - (Sec. 803) Amends federal criminal code provisions regarding the sexual exploitation of children to: (1) prohibit producers of visual depictions of sexually explicit conduct from refusing to permit the Attorney General to inspect records at business premises; and (2) modify the definition of "produces" to include actually filming, videotaping, photographing, or digitally manipulating an image of an actual human being that contains a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct.
