  <summary>9/20/2006--Introduced.
Truth in Video Game Rating Act - Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prescribe rules that prohibit as an unfair and deceptive act or practice: (1) any rating organization from assigning a content rating to any video or computer game unless it has reviewed its playable content; and (2) any producer, seller, or distributor of such games from withholding or hiding any playable content of the game from a rating organization with the intent of obtaining a less-restrictive content rating than the game would likely receive if such rating organization were to review the withheld or hidden content. Requires the FTC rules also to require any person submitting to a rating organization a video or computer game with hidden content to accompany it with the codes or methods necessary to access such hidden content. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the efficacy of the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) ratings system in assigning appropriate content ratings to video and computer games, and related questions.</summary>
