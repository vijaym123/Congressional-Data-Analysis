Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prepare, biennially, a diabetes report card for the nation and for each state that: (1) is adaptable by state and local agencies in order to rate or report local diabetes care, costs, and prevalence; and (2) includes trend analysis in order to track progress in meeting established national goals and objectives and to inform policy and program development. Requires the Secretary to: (1) identify existing efforts to increase awareness of the diabetes and screening benefit among Medicare beneficiaries and providers; and (2) maximize economies of scale, cost-effectiveness, and resource allocation in increasing utilization of the Medicare diabetes screening program. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to conduct, support, and promote the collection, analysis, and publication of data on the prevalence and incidence of type 1 and 2 diabetes and of pre-diabetes. Requires such activities to include an assessment of diabetes as a primary or underlying cause of death. Allows the Secretary to promote the addition to death certificates of language to improve the collection of diabetes mortality data. Requires the Secretary to conduct a study of the impact of diabetes on the practice of medicine in the United Sates and the level of diabetes medical education that should be required prior to licensure, board certification, and board recertification."
