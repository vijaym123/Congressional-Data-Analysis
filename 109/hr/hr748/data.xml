  <summary>4/27/2005--Passed House amended.
Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit transporting a minor across a state line to obtain an abortion (deems such transporting to be a de facto abridgment of the right of a parent under any law in the minor&#146;s state of residence that requires parental involvement in the minor&#146;s abortion decision). Makes an exception for an abortion necessary to safe the life of the minor. Protects from prosecution or civil liability the minor or the minor&#146;s parents for violations of this Act. Makes it an affirmative defense to a prosecution or civil action under this Act that a defendant reasonably believed that before the minor obtained the abortion, the required parental consent or notification or judicial authorization took place. Authorizes any parent who suffers harm from a violation of this Act to seek relief in a civil action. Defines "abortion" as the termination of a pregnancy with an intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth, preserve the life or health of the child after live birth, remove a dead unborn child who died as the result of a spontaneous abortion, accidental trauma, or a criminal assault on the pregnant female or her unborn child. Defines "parent" to include a guardian, legal custodian, or person standing in loco parentis. Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to one year on a physician who performs or induces an abortion on an out-of-state minor in violation of parental notification requirements. Requires such physician to give 24-hour actual or constructive notice to the parent of a minor seeking an abortion. Allows exceptions if: (1) the physician complies with parental notification requirements in the physician&#146;s state; (2) the physician is given documentation that a court in the minor&#146;s state of residence has waived parental notification or otherwise authorized the minor&#146;s abortion; (3) the minor provides a written statement that she is the victim of sexual abuse, neglect, or physical abuse by a parent and the physician notifies appropriate state officials of such abuse; or (4) the abortion is necessary to save the life of the minor.</summary>
