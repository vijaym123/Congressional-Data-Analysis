Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary concerned) from dividing a parcel of land consisting of 100 or more acres into smaller parcels to avoid such requirements. Specifies exceptions. Allows the Secretary concerned to waive such requirements with respect to the acquisition of a particular parcel of land in a time of war or a national emergency when such acquisition is necessary as part of the U.S. response to the war or national emergency."
