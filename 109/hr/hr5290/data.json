Waives the statute of limitations for civil actions against false claims for such assets, and any related hearing, if the action or hearing is commenced no later than one year after enactment of this Act. Requires the court to order that the proceeds of an action under this Act, or of a claim settlement, be returned to the owners of those assets, except for the portion awarded to any private person who brought the action. Prohibits the court from granting more than one extension of time during which the complaint may remain under seal (not to exceed six months)."
