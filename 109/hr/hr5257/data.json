Allows additional credit amounts of $2,000 for the taxpayer's spouse and $1,000 for each qualified dependent. Requires the basic standard deduction and the personal exemption amount for a taxpayer allowed such credit to be zero for that taxable year. Disallows such credit to an individual for whom a taxpayer is allowed a deduction as a dependent."
