(Sec. 1109) Directs the Secretary, before apportioning amounts to carry out the recreational trails program, to deduct $840,000 for FY2005-FY2009 for administrative, research, technical assistance, and training expenses for such program. Revises guidelines for permissible uses of funds apportioned for the recreational trails program. (Sec. 1110) Conditions approval of federal-aid highway funds upon installation and maintenance of proper temporary traffic control devices to improve safety in work zones during construction, utility, and maintenance operations. (Sec. 1111) Specifies set-asides for FY2005-FY2009 for projects for resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, and reconstructing any route or toll road on the Interstate System. (Sec. 1112) Authorizes appropriations for each fiscal year for allocations of emergency relief for the repair of damage to highways, roads, and trails (including Indian reservations) owing to a natural disaster if the total of those allocations in such fiscal year are in excess of $100 million. (Sec. 1113) Authorizes a state to obligate surface transportation program funds apportioned to it for: (1) capital and operating costs for advanced truck stop electrification systems; and (2) projects relating to intersections that have disproportionately high accident rates, high levels of congestion, and are located on a federal-aid highway. Repeals a safety programs set-aside under the surface transportation program. Extends through FY2009 the requirements of states under the surface transportation program to make a portion of certain funds for urbanized areas with a population of over 200,000 available for federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs. (Sec. 1114) Revises requirements for state applications for and approval of assistance for highway bridge replacement or rehabilitation. Authorizes the Secretary to approve federal participation in systematic preventive maintenance on a bridge and the installation of scour countermeasures. Requires the Secretary to determine the eligibility of highway bridges for replacement or rehabilitation for each state based on structurally deficient and functionally obsolete (currently, unsafe) highway bridges in the state. Extends the mandatory set-aside for off-system bridges through FY2009, repealing the 35% ceiling on the amount of a state apportionment for such set-aside. Provides a set-aside for FY2005 for the discretionary bridge program. Provides set-asides for FY2006-FY2009 for designated projects under the discretionary bridge program. Requires the Secretary to report annually in the Federal Register on construction materials used in new federal-aid bridge construction and bridge rehabilitation projects. (Sec. 1115) Designates funds for FY2005-FY2009 to implement specified intergovernmental projects for enforcement of the highway use tax. Revises requirements for the fuel excise tax reporting system. (Sec. 1116) Directs the Secretary to apportion funds under this Act for the Appalachian development highway system for FY2005-FY2009 among the States based on the latest available cost-to-complete estimate for the system. (Sec. 1117) Directs the Secretary to establish a comprehensive program to address the relationships among transportation, community, and system preservation plans and practices and identify private sector-based initiatives to improve such relationships. Requires the Secretary to allocate funds to states, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), local governments, and tribal governments to carry out eligible projects to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans and practices. Authorizes appropriations for FY2005-FY2009. (Sec. 1118) Amends federal highway law to revise requirements of the territorial highway program to make program funds available to the U.S. territories for: (1) surface transportation program projects; and (2) ferry boats, terminal facilities, and approaches. (Sec. 1119) Authorizes a state in which a proposed federal-aid project is to be undertaken by a federal agency in accordance with an agreement between a state and the federal agency to direct the Secretary to transfer the funds for the federal share of the project directly to the federal agency. Requires the Secretary on October 1 of each fiscal year to allocate sums appropriated for forest development roads and trails according to the relative needs of the various grasslands (as well as, under current law, national forests). Requires the Secretary of the Interior to distribute Indian reservation road funds, within 30 days after availability, and for immediate use, to Indian tribes in accordance with the distribution formula under the Indian reservation roads program. Limits the use of such funds to projects identified in a transportation improvement program approved by the Secretary. Earmarks a portion of funds for Indian reservation roads for FY2006-FY2009 for program management, oversight, and project-related administrative expenses. Authorizes an Indian tribe to commence road and bridge construction with Indian reservation road funds if it provides assurances that the construction will meet or exceed applicable health and safety standards. Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, to complete, and report to Congress, a national inventory of tribal transportation facilities eligible for assistance under the Indian reservation roads program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2005-FY2009 to carry out planning, design, engineering, preconstruction, construction, and inspection of projects to improve deficient Indian reservation road bridges, including multiple-pipe culverts. Revises Indian contracts and agreements requirements with respect to the provision of Indian reservation road funds. Allows an Indian tribe and a state to enter into a road maintenance agreement under which the tribe assumes state responsibilities for Indian reservation roads, including roads providing access to such roads. Establishes within the office of the Secretary of the Department of Transportation (DOT) a presidentially appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tribal Government Affairs to plan and implement DOT policy and programs serving Indian tribes and to coordinate tribal transportation programs in DOT. Earmarks an amount of public lands highway funds for each fiscal year for: (1) maintenance of forest highways; (2) signage identifying public public hunting and fishing access; and (3) the costs of facilitating the passage of aquatic species beneath National Forest System roads, including costs of constructing, maintaining, replacing, or removing culverts and bridges. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on methods to reduce collisions between motor vehicles and wildlife. Requires the Secretary, based on the study results, to develop a best practices manual to support state efforts to reduce wildlife vehicle collisions. (Sec. 1120) Directs the Secretary to allocate funds for FY2005-FY2009 for the Puerto Rico highway program. Sets forth a formula for the apportionment of such funds to Puerto Rico. (Sec 1121) Requires a state agency with jurisdiction over the operation of a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facility to establish occupancy requirements for vehicles of at least two occupants per vehicle. Requires such agency to permit motorcycles and bicycles to use the HOV facility, unless such use would constitute a safety hazard. Prescribes guidelines under which a state agency may permit use of an HOV facility by: (1) public transportation vehicles and high occupancy toll vehicles; and (2) inherently low-emission vehicles and low emission and energy-efficient vehicles. Permits tolls to be charged on a HOV facility on the Interstate System.
