  <summary>7/12/2006--Introduced.
Voter Bounty Registration Act of 2006 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prescribe standards for paid distribution of voter registration application forms. Prohibits any individual from distributing a voter registration application form for federal elections in a state if the individual: (1) is not registered to vote in such elections; (2) has been convicted of a felony under any state or federal law; (3) does not sign and print legibly the individual's name on the form; or (4) does not provide identifying information to the election official to whom the form will be submitted. Excepts from this prohibition the distribution of a voter registration application form by an individual who is not compensated directly or indirectly for it. Establishes criminal penalties for: (1) individuals not meeting such standards; and (2) anyone who employs such an individual knowingly, or who should reasonably be expected to know the individual is ineligible.</summary>
