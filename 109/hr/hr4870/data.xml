  <summary>3/2/2006--Introduced.
Declares that a certain decision of the Surface Transportation Board (Docket Number 34734) shall be the final decision regarding the application of Northeast Interchange Railway with respect to the rail line in Croton-on-Hudson, New York. Prohibits the Board from approving a lease and operation exemption application: (1) by a company operating less than 1,700 feet of track to haul waste unless the Board holds a public hearing; and (2) by a company to haul waste without a majority vote of the full Board. Directs the Board to require a company that becomes rail carrier to haul waste to comply with all applicable state and local zoning laws.</summary>
