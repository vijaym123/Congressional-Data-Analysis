  <summary>6/30/2005--Introduced.
Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program Act - Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program to ascertain and protect the environmental integrity of important coastal and estuarine areas. Directs the Secretary to make program grants to coastal states with approved coastal zone management plans to assist such states to acquire coastal and estuarine property. Limits grant funding from federal sources to 75 percent, unless the Secretary waives such limitation. Authorizes the Secretary to provide $5 million for a regional watershed protection demonstration project that: (1) leverages land acquisition funding from other federal conservation or acquisition programs; (2) involves partnerships with federal, state, and non-governmental entities; (3) creates conservation corridors; (4) protects habitats under imminent threat of development or conversion; (5) enhances protected areas under the National Estuarine Research Reserve program; and (6) provides a model for future regional watershed protection projects. Reserves 15 percent of program funds for acquisitions benefitting the National Estuarine Research Reserve. Allows the Secretary to enter into contracts or other arrangements with other federal agencies (including interagency financing of Coastal America activities) as well as any other qualified person for the purposes of carrying out technical assistance and research to support coastal zone management.</summary>
