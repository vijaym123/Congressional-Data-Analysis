Treats such statements or acts as unfair or deceptive acts or practices prescribed under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to conduct an investigation of health care providers engaging in such acts to: (1) identify specific acts and practices constituting a violation of this Act; (2) determine the frequency of such acts and practices; (3) identify instances of harm or injury resulting from such acts and practices; and (4) identify instances where any state public policy has permitted such acts and practices."
