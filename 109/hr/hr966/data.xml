  <summary>2/17/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 regarding relicensing criteria for nuclear facilities to direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to evaluate a facility for health risks, vulnerability to terrorist attack, evacuation plans, population increases, ability to store nuclear waste, safety and security record, and the impact of a nuclear accident. Prohibits relicensing of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station until after the NRC has: (1) arranged with the National Academy of Sciences to provide an independent assessment of safety performance and recommendations for relicensing; (2) transmitted those recommendations to Congress; and (3) given appropriate consideration to those recommendations. Directs the Academy to provide an independent assessment of: (1) conformance of the Station to its design and licensing bases; (2) operational safety performance and risk factors; (3) health risks, vulnerability to terrorist attack, evacuation plans, population increases, ability to store nuclear waste, safety and security record, and the impact of a nuclear accident; (4) the effectiveness of licensee self-assessments, corrective actions, and improvement plans; and (5) the cause of safety problems and overall performance.</summary>
