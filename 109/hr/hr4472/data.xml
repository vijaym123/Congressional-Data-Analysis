Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 - Recognizes the commitment of John and Reve Walsh to the protection of children from child predators on the 25th anniversary of the abduction and murder of their son, Adam. Title I: Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act - Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act - (Sec. 102) Declares as the purpose of this Act the establishment of a comprehensive national system for the registration of sex offenders and offenders against children. (Sec. 103) Establishes the Jacob Wetterling, Megan Nicole Kanka, and Pam Lychner Sex Offender Registration and Notification Program. Subtitle A: Sex Offender Registration and Notification - (Sec. 111) Establishes a three-tier classification system for sex offenders based upon specified criteria, including the seriousness of the underlying offense and the age of any child involved. Defines "sex offense" (to be known as the Amie Zyla Expansion of Sex Offense Definition) to mean: (1) a criminal offense that has an element involving a sexual act or contact or that is a specified offense against a minor; (2) a federal offense involving sex trafficking, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation or abuse of children, or domestic assault; (3) a specified military offense; or (4) an attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offense. Excludes from such definition foreign convictions lacking due process safeguards and certain offenses involving consensual sexual conduct. Defines "specified offense against a minor" to include offenses involving kidnapping, false imprisonment, sexual solicitation, video voyeurism, and possession, production, or distribution of child pornography. Defines "jurisdiction" to include a state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and federally recognized Indian tribes. (Sec. 112) Requires each jurisdiction to maintain a jurisdiction-wide sex offender registry. (Sec. 113) Requires a sex offender to: (1) register in each jurisdiction where such offender resides, is an employee, and is a student; (2) keep such registration current; and (3) for initial registrations, register in the jurisdiction where convicted if different than jurisdiction of residence. Requires jurisdictions (other than federally recognized Indian tribes) to impose a maximum criminal penalty greater than one year for sex offenders who fail to comply with registration requirements. (Sec. 114) Sets forth the information required in a sex offender's registration, including all addresses and places of employment and license plate numbers of all owned vehicles. Requires jurisdictions to include in a sex offender registry: (1) a physical description, current photograph, criminal history, fingerprints, palm prints, and a DNA sample of the sex offender; (2) the offender's criminal offense; and (3) a photocopy of the offender's driver's license or government-issued identification card. (Sec. 115) Specifies the duration of registration periods for sex offenders based on tier classifications. (Sec. 116) Requires sex offenders to appear in person periodically to verify information in a sex offender registry. (Sec. 117) Requires the appropriate official of a jurisdiction to notify sex offenders of their duty to register prior to release from custody or immediately after sentencing for a sex offense. (Sec. 118) Requires jurisdictions to provide public access to sex offender information through the Internet. Exempts from such disclosure the identity of any victim of a sex offense, the social security number of the sex offender, and any reference to arrests of the sex offender not resulting in conviction. (Sec. 119) Establishes the National Sex Offender Registry. Directs the Attorney General to maintain such registry at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and to ensure that updated information about sex offenders is immediately transmitted to all relevant jurisdictions. (Sec. 120) Establishes the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website to be maintained by the Attorney General. Requires such Website to include relevant information about sex offenders in each jurisdiction. (Sec. 121) Establishes the Megan Nicole Kanka and Alexandra Nicole Zapp Community Notification Program to provide for notification to the Attorney General, relevant jurisdictions, law enforcement agencies, social service entities, volunteer organizations, and other entities immediately after a sex offender registers or updates a registration. (Sec. 122) Requires appropriate officials of a jurisdiction to notify the Attorney General and appropriate law enforcement agencies of a failure of a sex offender to register and to note such failure in the jurisdiction's registry. (Sec. 123) Directs the Attorney General to develop and support software to enable jurisdictions to establish and operate uniform sex offender registries and Internet sites. Imposes a two-year deadline for developing such software. (Sec. 124) Requires jurisdictions to implement the requirements of this title before the later of three years after enactment of this Act and one year after the software developed by the Attorney General for sex offender registries becomes available. Authorizes the Attorney General to extend such deadlines. (Sec. 125) Reduces by 10% funding under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act of 1968 (OCCSSA) for jurisdictions which fail to implement the requirements of this title. (Sec. 126) Directs the Attorney General to establish and implement a Sex Offender Management Assistance (SOMA) program to award grants to jurisdictions to offset the costs of implementing this title. Authorizes bonus payments to jurisdictions that implement the requirements of this Act within two years of enactment. Authorizes appropriations for SOMA for FY2007-FY2009. (Sec. 127) Permits a federally recognized Indian tribe to elect to carry out the provisions of this subtitle or to delegate its functions to another jurisdiction. (Sec. 128) Directs the Attorney General to establish and maintain a system for notifying jurisdictions of sex offenders entering the United States who are required to register. (Sec. 129) Repeals certain provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Pam Lychner Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 relating to sex offender programs. (Sec. 130) Amends the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to grant civil and criminal immunity to personnel of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children arising out of the performance of CyberTipline responsibilities and functions, except for certain intentional, reckless, or malicious conduct. (Sec. 131) Grants immunity to the federal government and jurisdictions for good faith conduct in implementing the requirements of this title. Subtitle B: Improving Federal Criminal Law Enforcement to Ensure Sex Offender Compliance with Registration and Notification Requirements and Protection of Children From Violent Predators - (Sec. 141) Amends the federal criminal code to impose a fine and/or prison term of up to 10 years upon convicted sex offenders for failure to register or update a registration as required by the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Allows affirmative defenses to a prosecution for such offense, including an allegation that uncontrollable circumstances prevented registration. Increases criminal penalties for sex offenders who do not register and commit a crime of violence. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to consider certain criteria in promulgating sentencing guidelines for the crime of failure to register. Imposes increased criminal penalties for making false statements in a sex offense registration or in connection with certain sex crimes against children. Modifies probation and supervised release provisions for sex offenders required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to inform persons released from prison of the duty to register as a sex offender. (Sec. 142) Requires the Attorney General to use federal law enforcement resources, including the U.S. Marshals Service, to assist jurisdictions in locating and apprehending sex offenders who fail to register. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 143) Directs the Attorney General to create and maintain a Project Safe Childhood program. Designates funding under such program for: (1) integrated federal, state, and local efforts to investigate and prosecute child exploitation cases; (2) major case coordination by the Department of Justice; (3) increased federal involvement in child pornography and enticement cases; (4) law enforcement training; (5) community awareness and educational programs; (6) the addition of not less than eight Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the prosecution of cases under the program; (7) the addition of not less than 10 new Internet Crimes Against Children task forces within the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force Program; and (8) the development and enhancement by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the Innocent Images task forces. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 144) Directs the Attorney General to provide assistance to jurisdictions in identifying and locating a sex offender relocated due to a major disaster. (Sec. 145) Directs the Attorney General to: (1) expand training and technology efforts to respond to the threat posed by sex offenders who use the Internet and technology to solicit or exploit children; and (2) report to Congress by July 1, 2007, on such efforts. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 146) Establishes in the Department of Justice an Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, and Tracking to be headed by a presidentially-appointed Director.
