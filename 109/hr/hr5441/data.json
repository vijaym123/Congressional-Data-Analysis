Title V: General Provisions - (Sec. 504) Provides that none of the funds appropriated to DHS may be used to make payments to the DHS Working Capital Fund except for the activities and amounts allowed in the President's FY2007 budget, excluding sedan and shuttle service, transit subsidy, mail operations, parking, and competitive sourcing.

Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a detailed plan describing the dates for achieving key milestones and the methodology to be followed to support the Secretary's certification. Prohibits: (1) during testing, using information gathered from passengers, air carriers, or reservation systems to screen passengers or restrict boarding, except where passenger names are matched to a watch list; and (2) utilizing funds to develop algorithms assigning risk to passengers whose names are not on such lists or for data or a database obtained from or under the control of a non-federal entity. (Sec. 515) Prohibits the use of funds to: (1) amend the oath of allegiance required for naturalization; (2) process or approve a competition under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 for services provided as of June 1, 2004, by DHS Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services Immigration Information Officers, Contact Representatives, or Investigative Assistants; and (3) make Secret Service funds available for the protection of persons other than the Secretary.

Provides for access to SSI by parties in civil proceedings in U.S. district courts where the party demonstrates a substantial need of such SSI in the preparation of the party's case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the information by other means, provided that the overseeing judge enters an order that protects the SSI from unauthorized or unnecessary disclosure and specifies the terms and conditions of access.
