    "text": "Amends federal transportation law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules establishing a national motor vehicle tire fuel efficiency consumer information program to educate consumers about the effect of tires on automobile fuel efficiency. Requires information to be provided to consumers at the point of sale and other sites. Requires the Secretary to conduct periodic assessments of the rules to determine the utility of such rules to consumers, the level of cooperation by industry, and the contribution to national goals with respect to energy consumption. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring permanent labeling concerning tire fuel efficiency information on a tire. Permits a state to enforce a law or regulation on tire fuel efficiency consumer information in effect on January 1, 2006. Allows a state to adopt or enforce a tire fuel efficiency consumer information law or regulation that is enacted after January 1, 2006, only if it is identical to the federal requirement. Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed to preempt a state from regulating the fuel efficiency of tires not otherwise preempted under federal transportation law. Sets forth a civil penalty for persons who fail to comply with the consumer information program requirements of this Act."
