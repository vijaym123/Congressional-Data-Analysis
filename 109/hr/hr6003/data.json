Requires the Secretary to: (1) update the plan periodically; (2) develop and implement a training program to educate and promote awareness among commissioned and noncommissioned officers, front-line medical professionals and primary care providers, and military personnel and their families about the signs and risks of combat stress and stress-related psychopathology; (3) establish a working group to research and develop measures that reduce the likelihood of PTSD or other pathologies in combat veterans; and (4) establish a new Peer-Reviewed Research program for such research and development."
