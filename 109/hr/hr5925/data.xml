Directs the Secretary of Energy to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences to: (1) develop recommendations for evaluation measures and criteria for programs under this Act; and (2) evaluate the feasibility of prize and best practices award programs as tools to promote self-powered farms. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish an award program for up to 30 state agricultural research programs for self-powered farm demonstrations; (2) provide low-cost revolving loans and loan guarantees to eligible entities for the commercial application of energy or other technologies that will contribute to establishing self-powered farms, with highest preference given to applicants who propose to meet their energy needs from biobased feedstocks or other renewable energy sources produced on that farm; and (3) enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences for a review of the programs under this Act.</summary>
