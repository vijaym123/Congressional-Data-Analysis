    "text": "Directs the President to provide duty-free treatment for certain tents imported from Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, or Yemen (beneficiary countries). Prohibits a country from being designated, and if designated, requires it to be withdrawn if it is: (1) listed by the U.S. Department of State as a state sponsor of terrorism; or (2) engaged in activities that undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. Requires the President, after one year and annually thereafter, to review and determine if a basis exists for withdrawal of such duty-free treatment, taking into consideration: (1) whether or not each beneficiary country has established, or is making continual progress toward establishing, a market-based economy, the rule of law and the right to due process, political pluralism, and other specified economic and political goals; (2) the country's record on activities that undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, and support of a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; (3) whether it is a signatory of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, does not engage in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, and is making continuing and verifiable progress on the protection of internationally recognized human rights; (4) the country's participation in the primary, secondary, or tertiary economic boycott of Israel; and (5) whether it otherwise meets specified ineligibility criteria of the Trade Act of 1974. Requires the President to terminate the designation of any beneficiary country determined no longer to meet the requirements of this Act. Authorizes the President to designate the Palestinian Authority or its successor political entity as a beneficiary political entity, which, if so designated, shall be eligible for the duty-free treatment under this Act as if it were a beneficiary country, if the Authority: (1) does not participate in acts of terrorism, takes active measures to combat terrorism, and cooperates fully in international efforts to combat terrorism; (2) does not engage in activities that undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests; (3) does not engage in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, and is making continuing and verifiable progress on the protection of internationally recognized human rights; and (4) accepts Israel's right to exist in peace within secure borders. Requires the President to terminate the designation of the Authority if it is determined that the Authority no longer meets such requirements. Requires the President to notify Congress concerning the withdrawal of a country's or the Authority's designation. Prescribes the rule of origin for tents imported directly from beneficiary countries. Requires that the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in one or more beneficiary countries, plus the direct cost of processing operations performed in such beneficiary country or countries, be at least 35 percent of the appraised value of such article at the time it is entered into the U.S. customs territory."
