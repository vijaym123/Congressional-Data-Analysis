  <summary>6/30/2005--Introduced.
Foster Child Protection and Child Sexual Predator Sentencing Act of 2005 - Amends the Social Security Act provisions regarding federal payments for foster care and adoption assistance to require background checks before approval of foster or adoptive placements, including checks of national crime information databases and state child abuse registries. Requires safeguards to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information in a state child abuse and neglect registry and to prevent such information from being used for purposes other than conducting background checks in foster or adoptive placement cases. Directs the Attorney General, at the request of the chief executive of a state, to ensure that appropriate child welfare agencies have the authority for "read only" online access to the national crime information databases. Prohibits an individual from releasing information derived as a result of a check other than to appropriate child welfare agency officers or others legally authorized to receive it. Sets penalties for knowingly exceeding such authority or releasing information in violation of this Act. Increases penalties for: (1) coercion and enticement by sex offenders; (2) transportation of minors for criminal sexual activity; and (3) sexual abuse. Makes the confidential marital communication privilege and the adverse spousal privilege inapplicable in federal proceedings in which a spouse is charged with a crime against a child of, or under the custody or control of, either spouse. Establishes: (1) procedures for the civil commitment of sexually dangerous persons; and (2) mandatory minimum penalties for child sex trafficking.</summary>
