    "text": "Colorado Wilderness Act of 2005 - Designates specified lands in Colorado, administered by the Bureau of Land Management or the U.S. Forest Service, as wilderness and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Provides for the reservation and protection of U.S. water rights for such areas. Continues to allow the Colorado Army National Guard, through the High Altitude ARNG Aviation Training Site, to conduct aerial navigation training maneuver exercises over and upon the lands designated as wilderness and potential wilderness by this Act. Designates specified lands (proposed as Deep Creek Wilderness and Pisgah Mountain Wilderness) as potential wilderness areas. Requires such lands to be designated as wilderness upon publication of a notice that all nonconforming uses of those lands have ceased."
