Requires such an election to apply to all eligible individuals of that small employer at the time of such election, but does not require applicability to an individual who becomes eligible after such election. Allows an election under this Act to be made only with respect to coverage of a small employer under health insurance coverage that consists of a high deductible health plan and a contribution to a health savings account."
