Requires the Secretary, acting through the Coordinator, to award grants or cooperative agreements to public and nonprofit private entities that: (1) have experience in providing services to eligible individuals; and (2) have received or are eligible to receive funding from the federal government through the HIV health care services program or the Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS program. Allows the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to waive matching requirements and any other appropriate conditions for grants under the HIV health care services program. Allows the Coordinator to award grants or cooperative agreements to public and nonprofit private entities that provide covered services to eligible individuals in order to provide such entities with emergency infrastructure support. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to conduct a public awareness campaign directed toward eligible individuals who were receiving services through the federal HIV health care services program and for whom the hurricanes caused the disruption or termination of such services."
