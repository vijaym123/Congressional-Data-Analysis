  <summary>9/7/2005--Introduced.
Makes a Hurricane Katrina-affected veteran who is otherwise eligible for hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care from the Department of Veterans Affairs under a low priority for the provision of such care eligible, during the period beginning on August 28, 2005, and ending on August 31, 2007, for such care and services as if that veteran were covered for such care and services due to exposure to a war-related toxic substance, radiation, or related conditions (a higher priority). Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct an outreach program to enhance awareness of veterans eligible for such care and services.</summary>
