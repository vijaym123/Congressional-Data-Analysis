  <summary>4/5/2006--Introduced.
Henry J. Hyde Scholarships for Haiti Act of 2006 - Directs the President, acting through the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, to provide undergraduate scholarships, in the form of student loans followed by loan forgiveness, to needy Haitian students who, upon completion of their studies in the United States, promptly return to Haiti for a period at least one year longer than the duration of such scholarships. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2009. Reserves a specified minimum amount of certain authorized development assistance appropriations under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for literacy and basic education programs in Haiti. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President, acting through the Director of the Peace Corps, should make available again to the Government of Haiti qualified Peace Corps volunteers who would serve under hardship conditions to: (1) assist the people of Haiti to improve literacy rates and meet other basic needs so that they can become economically self-sufficient; and (2) promote mutual understanding between the peoples of the United States and of Haiti. Urges the President to: (1) design a program to match scholarship contributions from private and public sectors in either country; (2) seek to engage domestic and international businesses in Haiti to maximize the opportunities of returning scholarship recipients for the development of Haiti; and (3) provide the scholarships through existing scholarship programs, such as the Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships program.</summary>
