Prohibits increasing the credit limit on an account for which a parent or guardian has assumed joint liability without the parent's or guardian's approval. Prohibits a creditor from opening a credit card account for any such college student who: (1) has no annual gross income; and (2) already has a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan."
