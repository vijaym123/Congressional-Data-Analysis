  <summary>9/27/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act to prohibit a franchisor of leased marketing premises from transferring or assigning its interest in the franchise during the term of the franchise unless the franchisor, at least 45 days before the proposed transfer or assignment, has first: (1) made a bona fide offer to the franchisee to sell, transfer, or assign to the franchisee the franchisor's interests in the premises; or (2) offered the right of first refusal (of at least 45 days' duration) to the franchisee regarding an offer made by another to acquire the franchisor's interests in the premises. Declares null, void, and unenforceable a franchise or marketing agreement that, in the event of litigation, calls for payment by either party of the prevailing party's legal expenses.States that it shall be a violation of the Act for a refiner or distributor to fix or maintain motor fuel retail prices at a retail outlet supplied by that refiner or distributor, unless the refiner or distributor also operates such outlet.</summary>
