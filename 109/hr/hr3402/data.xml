States that the Secretary, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of State shall continue to have discretion to consent to an alien's reapplication for admission after a previous order of removal, deportation, or exclusion. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretaries and the Attorney General should particularly consider exercising such authority in VAWA cases involving T- or U-visa nonimmigrants, and cases involving cancellation of removal and status adjustment for battered spouses and children.

Requires grant applications to propose: (1) a program strategy targeting areas with the highest incidence of youth violence and homicides; (2) outcome measures and specific objective indicia of performance to assess the effectiveness of the program; and (3) a plan for evaluation by an independent third party. Directs the Attorney General to ensure that no less than one grant recipient is: (1) a city with a population exceeding 1 million and an increase of at least 30% in the aggregated juvenile and young adult homicide victimization rate during calendar year 2005 as compared to calendar year 2004; and (2) a nonmetropolitan county or group of counties with per capita arrest rates of juveniles and young adults for serious violent offenses that exceed the national average for nonmetropolitan counties by at least 5%. Requires the Attorney General to give preference to entities operating programs that meet criteria including a program focus on reducing youth violence and homicides and fieldwork and neighborhood outreach in communities where young violent offenders live. Limits the federal share of a grant award to 90% of total program costs. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2009.</summary>
