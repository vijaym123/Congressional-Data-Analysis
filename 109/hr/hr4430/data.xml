  <summary>11/18/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to deem qualified homeowner downpayment assistance as a charitable purpose for income, estate, and gift tax purposes. Defines "qualified homeowner downpayment assistance" as a gift of cash for the purpose of providing any downpayment for the purchase of a principal residence for a taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income does not exceed $110,000. Limits the amount of such gift to the lesser of $60,000 or 20 percent of the value of the residence. Denies an income tax deduction to a donor of homeowner downpayment assistance who receives a direct financial benefit in connection with the purchase of a principal residence for which downpayment assistance was provided.</summary>
