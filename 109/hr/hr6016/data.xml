Prohibits specified certifications transmitted by the President to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate on June 28, 2006, relating to the proposed sales of defense articles and defense services to Pakistan from being effective for purposes of complying with the congressional notification requirements of the Arms Export Control Act. Declares that: (1) any letter of offer with respect to such proposed sales of defense articles and defense services to Pakistan issued before the date of the enactment of this Act null and void; and (2) any subsequent letter of offer with respect to such proposed sales of defense articles and defense services to Pakistan issued on or after the date of the enactment of this Act shall be issued only in accordance with the congressional notification requirements of the Arms Export Control Act. Expresses the sense of Congress that, if the President desires to proceed with such proposed sales of defense articles and defense services to Pakistan, the President should only proceed with such sales in accordance with long-standing practice and procedures relating to congressional review of proposed sales of defense articles and defense services, including by providing specified advance notification to and consultation with Congress.</summary>
