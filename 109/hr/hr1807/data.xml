Community Environmental Equity Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit any entity that handles, manages, treats, releases, discharges, disposes, stores, transports, removes, moves, or delivers any covered substance from disproportionately exposing any person or community to such substance on the ground of race, color, national origin, or economic status. Defines "covered substance" to include: (1) any contaminant identified under the Safe Drinking Water Act; (2) any pesticide chemical under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; (3) any chemical listed as a known or probably human carcinogen under the National Toxicology Program of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); (4) any chemical substance or mixture regulated under the Toxic Substance Control Act; (5) any hazardous waste identified under the Solid Waste Disposal Act; (6) any pesticide registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act; (7) any air pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act; and (8) such other contaminants, chemicals, materials, wastes, and substances as appropriate. Requires such an entity to: (1) work in partnership with State and local government officials and the Federal Government to comply with this Act; and (2) address actual or potential disproportionate exposure of covered substances prior to pursuing authorization or approval to work with such substances. Authorizes enforcement: (1) by denial or termination of authorization to work with covered substances; (2) by any other means authorized by law; and (3) for an entity receiving Federal financial assistance, through specified compliance provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</summary>
