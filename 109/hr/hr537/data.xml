  <summary>2/2/2005--Introduced.
National Fisheries Mitigation Coordination Act - Directs a sponsor agency (the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, or the Tennessee Valley Authority) to pay to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service mitigation fishery costs associated with carrying out the fishery mitigation plan for a water development project developed between the Service and one or more sponsor agencies. Defines mitigation fishery costs as the expenditures necessary to operate, maintain, and rehabilitate facilities to conduct mitigation fishery activities, including the rearing and stocking of native and nonnative fish to replace or maintain harvest levels lost as a result of Federal water resource development projects.</summary>
