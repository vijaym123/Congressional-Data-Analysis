  <summary>3/4/2010--Passed Senate without amendment.
Urges the U.S. government and the international community to provide resources to support the government of Haiti's leadership of international assistance efforts and to conduct a post-disaster needs assessment that will focus on: (1) social sector services; (2) population resettlement; (3) stable and democratic governance; (4) economic sustainability; and (5) public order and rule of law. Encourages the U.S. government and the international community to support the leadership of the government of Haiti and key nongovernmental and private sector Haitian stakeholders to create a national recovery and development strategy. Applauds the international community's response to the preliminary appeal for assistance. Encourages: (1) international financial institutions and international organizations to continue their engagement in support of critical economic and security priorities; and (2) the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank to relieve Haiti of its external debt obligations and seek new resources without adding to Haiti's existing debt obligations. Urges the U.S. government to assign a single person to coordinate U.S. assistance to Haiti.</summary>
