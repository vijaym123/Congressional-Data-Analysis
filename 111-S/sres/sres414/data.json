Encourages the U.S. government and the international community to support the leadership of the government of Haiti and key nongovernmental and private sector Haitian stakeholders to create a national recovery and development strategy. Applauds the international community's response to the preliminary appeal for assistance. Encourages: (1) international financial institutions and international organizations to continue their engagement in support of critical economic and security priorities; and (2) the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank to relieve Haiti of its external debt obligations and seek new resources without adding to Haiti's existing debt obligations. Urges the U.S. government to assign a single person to coordinate U.S. assistance to Haiti."
