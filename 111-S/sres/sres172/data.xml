  <summary>6/8/2009--Passed Senate without amendment.
Designates June 2009 as National Aphasia Awareness Month. Expresses support for efforts to: (1) increase awareness of aphasia (a communication impairment caused by brain damage that typically results from a stroke); and (2) make the voices of people with aphasia heard. Recognizes that strokes are the third-largest cause of death and disability in the United States. Acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and study in order to find new solutions.</summary>
