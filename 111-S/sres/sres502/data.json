Requires the Secretary of the Senate to maintain for both the Senate Calendar of Business and the Senate Executive Calendar a separate section entitled \"Notices of Intent to Object to Proceeding.\" Authorizes a Senator to have an item relating to that Senator removed from a calendar to which it was added by submitting for inclusion in the Congressional Record a notice specifying that the Senator does not object to proceeding to such measure or matter."
