Calls upon all parties in Iraq to ensure that the elections are free, without intimidation, and to not inflame communal tensions. Urges the surrounding countries to: (1) refrain from exercising destabilizing interference in Iraq's internal affairs; and (B) allow the Iraqi people to determine their own future. Calls for the timely formation of an inclusive post-election Iraqi government. Expresses gratitude to the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Foreign Service, and other federal government agencies for their service and heroism in Iraq. Commends the Iraqi people for their courage, sacrifice, and hard-won gains in fighting terrorism and building a peaceful democracy."
