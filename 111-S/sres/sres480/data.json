Calls upon the Secretary of State to: (1) assess the effectiveness of the policy of engagement with the military regime in Burma in furthering U.S. interests and to maintain and consider strengthening sanctions if the military regime continues its systematic violation of human rights; (2) engage regional governments and multilateral organizations to push for democratic transition to civilian rule in Burma; and (3) support the people of Burma in calling for constitutional and election reforms by the military regime."
