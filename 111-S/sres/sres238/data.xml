  <summary>8/4/2009--Introduced.
Makes it out of order in the Senate to consider legislation that: (1) eliminates or reduces the ability of Americans to keep their health plan or their choice of doctor; or (2) decreases the number of Americans enrolled in private health insurance, while increasing the number of Americans enrolled in government-managed health care. Suspends such point of order upon certification by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that the legislation does not cause such actions. Permits waiver or suspension of such prohibition, or successful appeals from rulings of the Chair, only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Senate.</summary>
