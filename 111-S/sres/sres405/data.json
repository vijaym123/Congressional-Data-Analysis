Condemns the cyber attacks allegedly launched from China against Google and other companies and calls on the government of China to review such cyber intrusions. Pays tribute to the professional and citizen journalists who persevere in their dedication to report in China. Urges companies to refuse to aid in the curtailment of free expression. Calls on the President and the Secretary to develop means by which the U.S. government can rapidly respond to threats against the freedoms of press and expression."
