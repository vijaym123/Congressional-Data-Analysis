  <summary>12/4/2009--Passed Senate without amendment.
Supports the civilians in Yemen, especially displaced persons, who have suffered from instability, terrorist operations, and chronic underdevelopment in Yemen. Applauds steps that have been taken by the President and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to assist displaced persons in Yemen. Recognizes the threat instability and terrorism in Yemen pose to the security of the United States, the region, and the population in Yemen. Calls on the President to: (1) promote economic and political reforms in Yemen; and (2) give sufficient weight to the situation in Yemen in efforts to prevent terrorist attacks on the United States, U.S. allies, and Yemeni civilians. Urges the government of Yemen and rebel forces to halt hostilities.</summary>
