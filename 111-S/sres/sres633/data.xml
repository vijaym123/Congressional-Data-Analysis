Designates September 23, 2010, as National Falls Prevention Awareness Day. Commends the Falls Free Coalition Advocacy Work Group and the 31 state falls coalitions for their efforts to work together to increase education and awareness about the prevention of falls among older adults. Encourages: (1) businesses, individuals, governments, the public health community, and health care providers to work together to promote the awareness of, and reduce the incidence of, falls among older adults in the United States; (2) state health departments to reduce falls among older adults; and (3) experts in the field to share best practices. Urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to continue developing and evaluating strategies to prevent falls among older adults that will translate into effective fall prevention interventions, including community-based programs.</summary>
