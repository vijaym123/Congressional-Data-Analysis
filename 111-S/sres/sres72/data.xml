  <summary>3/10/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) Mexico is a key strategic partner of the United States; (2) increasing violence and criminality of drug trafficking organizations threaten the people of the United States and Mexico and is a "cross-border" problem requiring close U.S.-Mexico cooperation; (3) efforts by President Felipe Calder&#243;n and his government and the people of Mexico to confront the drug trafficking organizations should be supported; and (4) the U.S. government should employ its diplomatic and law enforcement resources, in partnership with the government of Mexico and governments throughout the Americas, to defeat drug-related criminal enterprises.</summary>
