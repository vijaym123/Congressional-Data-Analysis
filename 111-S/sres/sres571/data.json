Expresses: (1) commitment to the survival of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state within recognized and secure borders; (2) support in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the creation of a democratic, viable, and independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside Israel; (3) sympathy for Gilad Shalit's family and the families of other missing Israeli soldiers; and (4) commitment to seek the release of Gilad Shalit and other missing Israeli soldiers. Recalls: (1) the attack on and kidnapping of the bodies of Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev by the Iran-supported terrorist group Hezbollah; and (2) the missing Israeli soldiers Zecharya Baumel, Zvi Feldman, Yehuda Katz, Ron Arad, Guy Hever, and Majdy Halabi. Condemns: (1) Hamas for the illegal and immoral cross border attack and kidnapping of Gilad Shalit; and (2) Iran and Syria, the primary state sponsors and patrons of Hamas, for their ongoing support for international terrorism."
