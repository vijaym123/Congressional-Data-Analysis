Urges President Obama to: (1) reject, and call attention to, the violent measures taken by authorities in Venezuela against citizens who are exercising their constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties; and (2) support peaceful civil society groups in Venezuela and take measures to protect the flow of uncensored information in Venezuela."
