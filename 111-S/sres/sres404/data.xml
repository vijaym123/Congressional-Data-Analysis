  <summary>3/4/2010--Passed Senate without amendment.
Acknowledges the importance of preventing a renewed North-South civil war in Sudan which would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences for Sudan and could destabilize the wider region. Supports efforts by: (1) President Obama and the international community to reinvigorate implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement; and (2) the U.S. government, other donors, and the United Nations to assist the government of Southern Sudan to improve its governing capacity. Calls on: (1) the parties in Sudan to comply with their Agreement commitments; (2) the government of National Unity to avoid actions that would unduly restrict the freedom of speech and assembly by opposition parties or the full participation of communities in the upcoming national elections; and (3) the government of Southern Sudan to work with the assistance of the international community to implement a long-term plan for security sector reform. Urges the U.N. Security Council to assist the U.N. peacekeepers to better monitor, and work to prevent, violence in southern Sudan and to prioritize civilian protection.</summary>
