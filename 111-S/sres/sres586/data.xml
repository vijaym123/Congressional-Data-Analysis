  <summary>7/20/2010--Introduced.
Reaffirms that respect for human rights is a fundamental U.S. value and that providing unconditional support for governments that do not respect human rights undermines U.S. credibility and creates tensions, including in the Muslim world, that can be exploited. Recognizes that while the government of Egypt faces legitimate security threats political reform in that country will help to counter extremism and solidify prospects for stability and prosperity. Encourages the government of Egypt to repeal the state of emergency. Calls on the government of Egypt to lift legislative restrictions on freedoms of assembly, association, and expression in advance of the 2010 elections. Urges the President and the Secretary of State to: (1) make respect for human rights and democratic freedoms a priority in the U.S.-Egyptian relationship; and (2) broaden engagement with the people of Egypt and support human rights and democratic reform efforts in Egypt.</summary>
