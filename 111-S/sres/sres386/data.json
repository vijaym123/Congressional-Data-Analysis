Welcomes the the Department of State decision to support the free flow of information to Iranian citizens by recommending that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issue a general license that would authorize downloads of free mass market software to Iran. Urges implementation of the Victims of Iranian Censorship Act."
