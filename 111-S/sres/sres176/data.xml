  <summary>6/9/2009--Passed Senate without amendment.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that the U.S. government, in coordination with other democratic governments and international institutions, should: (1) continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe; (2) make available increased resources for nongovernmental entities to provide assistance in the critical areas of education, health, water, and sanitation; (3) encourage international efforts to support reforms made by ministries within the government of Zimbabwe, especially the Ministry of Finance; (4) provide financial and technical assistance for efforts to enact a new constitution based on democratic values; (5) work with and encourage regional governments and leaders to promote human rights, the restoration of the rule of law, and economic growth in Zimbabwe; (6) maintain the existing ban on the transfer of defense items and services and the suspension of most non-humanitarian government-to-government assistance until there is demonstrable progress toward restoring the rule of law and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe; and (7) support the continuation of financial sanctions and travel bans against those individuals responsible for the deliberate breakdown of the rule of law in Zimbabwe.</summary>
