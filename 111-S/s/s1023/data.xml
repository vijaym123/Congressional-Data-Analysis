  <summary>9/9/2009--Passed Senate amended.
Travel Promotion Act of 2009 - Establishes the Corporation for Travel Promotion as an independent nonprofit corporation. Makes the Corporation subject to the provisions of the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Corporation should not engage in lobbying activities. Requires the Corporation, among other things, to provide useful information to people interested in traveling to the United States, counter and correct misperceptions regarding U.S. entry policy, and promote U.S. travel. Requires the Corporation to develop and maintain a publicly accessible website. Requires the Corporation to establish annual objectives and an annual marketing plan and to submit an annual Corporation activities report to Congress. Establishes in the Treasury the Travel Promotion Fund and requires non-federal matching funds. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require (under current law, authorize) the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish and collect a fee for the use of an electronic data sharing system concerning the admissibility of certain aliens into the United States that will ensure recovery of the full costs of providing and administering such system. Terminates such fee following FY2014. Authorizes the Corporation to impose an annual assessment on U.S. members of the travel and tourism industry represented on the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Amends the International Travel Act of 1961 to establish in the Department of Commerce the Office of Travel Promotion, to be headed by a Director. Requires that the Office of Travel and Tourism Industries expand its research and development activities to promote international travel to the United States. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
