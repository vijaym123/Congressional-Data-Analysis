SAFE Port Reauthorization Act - Authorizes appropriations for port security grants. Amends the SAFE Port Act to authorize appropriations for: (1) the automated targeting system for identifying and inspecting high-risk oceanborne container cargo; (2) the Container Security Initiative; and (3) the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). Permits: (1) unannounced inspections of a C-TPAT participant's security measures; and (2) provision of voluntary supply chain security training. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a program to promote sharing of private sector security-related information. Requires the Secretary, prior to entering into an agreement between the United States and a foreign government providing for mutual recognition of supply chain security programs, to: (1) notify Congress of such agreement's terms; and (2) determine that the foreign government's program provides a C-TPAT level of security. Sets forth exemptions to the requirement that a container loaded on a vessel in a foreign port not be allowed into the United States unless it was scanned by nonintrusive imaging and radiation detection equipment prior to loading. Directs the Secretary to establish the America's Waterway Watch Program to promote voluntary public and industry recognition and reporting of suspected terrorist activity or suspicious behavior against a vessel, facility, port, or waterway. Directs the Secretary to provide for maritime and cargo security research and development, as well as a maritime and cargo security demonstration project. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to provide a foreign government with port security and safety assistance.</summary>
