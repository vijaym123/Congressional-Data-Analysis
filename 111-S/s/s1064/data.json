    "text": "Enhanced Oversight of State and Local Economic Recovery Act - Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to require federal agencies receiving funds under such Act, subject to guidance from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to reasonably adjust applicable limits on administrative expenditures for federal awards to help award recipients defray costs of data collection, auditing, contract and grant planning and management, and investigations of waste, fraud, and abuse required under such Act. Authorizes state and local governments receiving funds to set aside up to .5% of such funds, in addition to any funds already allocated to administrative expenditures, to conduct planning and oversight to prevent and detect waste, fraud, and abuse. Authorizes the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to provide for the use by state and local governments of GSA federal supply schedules for goods or services that are funded by such Act. Makes participation by a firm that sells to a state or local government through such schedule voluntary. Requires the Administrator, for authorized nonfederal users of federal supply schedules, to: (1) review the existing ordering guidance and, as necessary, prescribe additional guidance to ensure proper usage and to maximize task and delivery order competition; (2) make available the online electronic Request for Quote/Request for Proposal system; and (3) make available, free of charge, training related to proper schedule usage, including online training courses. Requires the OMB Director to issue guidance to ensure accurate and consistent reporting of \"jobs created\" and \"jobs retained\" as those terms are used in such Act. Amends the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to require OMB to ensure that the federal awards website established under such Act: (1) clearly differentiates between projects funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and other federal awards; and (2) provides users with the ability to perform searches for information in the website relating only to amounts funded by ARRA. Requires the website Recovery.gov (established under ARRA) to prominently display a link to the federal awards website on its front page."
