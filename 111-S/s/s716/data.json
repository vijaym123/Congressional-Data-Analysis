Revises ventilator-dependent patient days requirements for the disproportionate patient percentage in the formula for calculation of an additional Medicare payment for each subsection (d) hospital. (Generally, a subsection (d) hospital is an acute care hospital, particularly one that receives payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)"
