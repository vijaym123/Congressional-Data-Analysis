    "text": "Counternarcotics and Citizen Security for the Americas Act of 2010 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to include a report on interagency counternarcotics strategy for the region of Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean (Region) in the President's annual international narcotics control strategy report to Congress. Directs the President to ensure coordination of counternarcotics programs among relevant agencies, including: (1) the Department of State; (2) the United States Agency for International Development (USAID); (3) the Department of Justice (DOJ); (4) the Department of Defense (DOD); (5) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); and (6) the intelligence community. Prohibits any U.S. government international counternarcotics or anti-crime foreign assistance-related activity from being implemented without the Secretary of State's approval, under the direction of the President. Requires federal assistance through current counternarcotics programs to be provided in the Region for: (1) operational, intelligence, and forensic support; and (2) capacity- and institution-building. Requires that U.S. Armed Forces, law enforcement, and civilian contractor personnel employed by the United States comply with specified requirements under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 regarding participation in foreign police actions. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to: (1) permit a U.S. officer or employee to make a foreign arrest as part of a foreign police narcotics control action conducted in connection with a declared contingency operation if the foreign country agrees to the waiver and such waiver has been approved by the Secretary; and (2) make aircraft available to foreign countries for emergency rescue and humanitarian operations on a case-by-case basis upon Chief of Mission approval. Directs the President to take steps to ensure the immediate U.S return of any helicopter procured with U.S. funds that is used to aid any terrorist, illegal self-defense group, paramilitary organization, or guerrilla organization in Colombia. Directs the Secretary to monitor the environmental and health effects of counternarcotics herbicide use in the Region. Expresses the sense of Congress regarding the use of contractors in recipient countries."
