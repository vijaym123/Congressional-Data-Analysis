Excellence in Mental Health Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to set forth criteria for the certification of federally-qualified community behavioral health centers. Amends the PHSA and titles XIX (Medicaid) and XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to make such centers eligible for certain federal programs, including: (1) payments for services under Medicaid; (2) incentives for the adoption of health information technology; and (3) payments for the provision of telehealth services. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award matching grants to states or Indian tribes to expend funds for the construction or modernization of facilities used to provide mental health and substance abuse services to individuals. Expands the 340B drug discount program (a program limiting the cost of covered outpatient drugs to certain federal grantees) to allow participation by entities providing community mental health services or providing treatment services for substance abuse.</summary>
