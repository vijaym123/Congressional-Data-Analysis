Requires the Secretaries to: (1) establish a nationwide policy for governing backcountry aviation issues relating to the management of federal land under the jurisdiction of the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture; and (2) require officials with jurisdiction over such land to adhere to such policy. Requires private and publicly-owned aircraft land strips acquired by the government to be made available to the public for unrestricted use."
