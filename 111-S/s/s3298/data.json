Requires the Secretary to award grants to Prevention Research Centers or universities to evaluate programs carried out under such grants. Requires the Secretary to coordinate activities conducted under this Act with activities undertaken by the National Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council, to the extent practicable, including by: (1) sharing current and emergent best practices concerning healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time limits that have a population-level impact in promoting nutrition and physical activity in child care settings; and (2) promoting the effective implementation and sustainability of such programs; and (3) avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort."
