  <summary>7/14/2009--Introduced.
Connecting America Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) broadband providers a tax credit for investment in broadband equipment and services to enhance Internet access in unserved areas; and (2) a tax credit to holders of private activity bonds designated as Broadband America Bonds to finance the deployment of broadband services. Establishes the Office of National Broadband Strategy in the Department of Commerce to assist entities in applying for funds for specified broadband and telecommunication programs. Requires such Office to establish a National Advisory Panel on broadband deployment and adoption to review and evaluate the status of industry efforts to promote broadband in underserved and unserved areas, the effectiveness of government programs that fund broadband deployment, and the effect of broadband deployment on economic competitiveness. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to expand telecommunication services for rural healthcare providers. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to educational institutions and other agencies to carry out PlugGED In programs to provide instruction in technology skills to secondary school students and students in high school equivalency programs.</summary>
