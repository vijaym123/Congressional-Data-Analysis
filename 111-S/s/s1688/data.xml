  <summary>9/17/2009--Introduced.
Fairness in Representation Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in conducting the 2010 decennial census and every decennial census thereafter, to include in any questionnaire used for the purpose of determining the total population by states, a checkbox or similar option for respondents to indicate citizenship status or lawful presence in the United States. Requires the Secretary to adjust census figures as necessary so that those who are not U.S. citizens or are not lawfully present in the United States are not counted in tabulating population for purposes of apportioning Representatives in Congress among the states.</summary>
