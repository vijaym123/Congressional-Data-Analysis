Directs the NTIA and FCC to report to Congress on such inventory. Allows a licensee or government user to petition the NTIA or the FCC for a partial or total exemption from website inclusion. Allows an exemption to be granted only to the extent that each such agency determines that disclosure of the information would be harmful to U.S. national security. Makes such exemptions applicable for a two-year period, unless there is a request for, and granting of, an extension. Requires information excluded under an exemption to be compiled and reported to Congress on a confidential basis."
