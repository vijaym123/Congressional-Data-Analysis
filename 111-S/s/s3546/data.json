Directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to publish best practices for states to use in licensing: (1) auto body shops that perform work paid for by insurers; and (2) medical treatment for people injured in auto accidents. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) cooperate with the offices of the United States attorneys to investigate fraudulent chop shops and salvage yards, prosecute automobile insurance fraud, and report statistics on investigations, prosecutions, and convictions of automobile insurance fraud; and (2) establish Federal-State-Local Anti-Auto Insurance Fraud Task Forces in cities most severely affected by automobile insurance fraud. Grants an insurance company the right to require a mandatory inspection of any motor vehicle prior to agreeing to provide insurance coverage and to waive such right under specified circumstances."
