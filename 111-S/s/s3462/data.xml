Authorizes the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, or any subcommittee or member of the Commission, as considered advisable in consultation with the Attorney General, to: (1) hold hearings, meet and act, take testimony and receive evidence, and administer oaths; and (2) require, by subpoena or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, records, correspondence, memoranda, papers, documents, tapes, and materials. Authorizes, in the case of contumacy or failure of a person to obey a subpoena, a U.S. district court for the district in which the subpoenaed person resides, is served, or may be found to issue an order requiring appearance at any designated place to testify or to produce documentary or other evidence. Deems failure to obey such an order to be contempt of court.</summary>
