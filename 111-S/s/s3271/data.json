Requires the owner's manual of new motor vehicles to indicate clearly the presence of EDRs. Prohibits the retrieval of information recorded or transmitted by an EDR by any person other than the owner of the motor vehicle in which such device is installed, unless: (1) a court authorizes it, the owner consents, or the information is retrieved by a government motor vehicle safety agency; and (2) neither the personally identifiable information of the vehicle owner or driver nor the vehicle identification number (VIN) is disclosed in the retrieval of information."
