Makes it out of order to consider in the Senate: (1) new or general legislation or any unauthorized appropriation included in an appropriation bill; (2) any amendment to an appropriation bill with the effect of adding an unauthorized appropriation to it; or (3) any unauthorized appropriation included in any amendment between the chambers, or any amendment to such an amendment, in relation to a general appropriation bill. Amends Rule XLIV (Congressionally Directed Spending and Related Items), which makes it out of order to vote on the adoption of a conference report in the Senate unless it is available on a publicly accessible congressional website at least 48 hours before such vote. Specifies that such website availability must be in a searchable format. Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to require a recipient of federal funds to disclose any registered lobbyist to whom the recipient paid money to lobby on behalf of such funding, including the amount of such funds."
