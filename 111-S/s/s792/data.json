Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to: (1) develop standards for collection of data elements for state cancer registries; (2) develop inter-operability and security standards for data exchange and integration between state cancer registries and any cancer registry and another federal registry for non-cancer diseases; and (3) provide a basic electronic collection tool to facilitate standardized data collection. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to facilitate coordination of the National Program of Cancer Registries with other federally-supported registry programs, including infectious disease registries, environmental disease registries, and other non-cancer, chronic disease registries."
