Authorizes the Secretary to lower the maximum somatic cell count after consideration of any recommendations submitted by the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations to require that the calculation of a herd average somatic cell count under this Act be made using a geometric, rather than an arithmetic, mean. Subjects any person that sells, transports, or offers for sale or transport in interstate commerce any dairy product in violation of this Act to a civil penalty."
