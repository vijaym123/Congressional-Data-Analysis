  <summary>8/5/2010--Introduced.
Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPA) to prohibit federal loan guarantees for innovative technologies unless: (1) an appropriation for the cost of the guarantee has been made; (2) the Secretary of Energy (DOE) has received and deposited into the Treasury payment in full from the borrower for the cost of the guarantee; or (3) a combination of appropriations or payments from the borrower has been made that is sufficient to cover the cost of the guarantee. Authorizes the Secretary to waive requirements to provide a third-party credit report if: (1) such report, in the Secretary's opinion, is not relevant to the determination of the credit risk of a project; (2) the project costs are not projected to exceed $100 million; and (3) the applicant agrees to accept the credit rating the Secretary assigns. Authorizes the head of the loan guarantee program, if there is either a severe shortage of candidates or a severe hiring need for particular positions, to recruit and directly appoint into the competitive service highly qualified critical personnel with specialized knowledge important to program functions (direct hire authority). Amends the EPA and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to authorize the Secretary to: (1) retain agents and professional advisors in connection with guarantees and related activities; and (2) require loan guarantee applicants and recipients to pay all fees and expenses of such agents and advisors. Authorizes the Secretary to make energy efficiency loan guarantees for projects starting construction by September 30, 2011, to retrofit residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, facilities, and equipment.</summary>
