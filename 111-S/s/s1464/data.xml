Nuclear Trafficking Prevention Act - Declares it to be the policy of the United States that the transfer of a nuclear weapon or device or of nuclear material or technology for terrorist purposes is a crime against humanity and should be punished under customary international criminal law. Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer of a nuclear weapon or device, or of nuclear material or sensitive nuclear technology, to any foreign terrorist organization or any other person engaged in terrorist activities. Grants extraterritorial jurisdiction to prosecute violations of this Act. Imposes a fine and minimum prison term of 25 years for violations (life imprisonment for violations resulting in death). Requires the Secretary of State to direct the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations and representatives to bilateral and multilateral fora to seek international recognition that the transfer of nuclear weapons, devices, material, or technology for terrorist purposes is a crime against humanity.</summary>
