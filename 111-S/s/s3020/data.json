Requires the Administrator to: (1) implement policies for ensuring that only qualified HUBZone small businesses are participating in the HUBZone program; (2) report to the congressional small businesses concerning qualification for, and recertification of, a HUBZone small business; and (3) develop measures and implement plans to assess HUBZone program effectiveness. Amends the Small Business Act to prohibit the Administrator, during the period beginning on the date that a small business is determined qualified as a HUBZone small business and ending the day before a HUBZone program contract for which such small business submits a bid is awarded, from determining that the small business is no longer qualified based on a failure to meet the applicable employment percentage unless, among other things, the small business has not attempted to maintain such percentage."
