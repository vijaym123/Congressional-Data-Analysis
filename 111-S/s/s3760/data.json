    "text": "Automatic IRA Act of 2010 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) require certain employers who do not maintain qualified retirement plans or arrangements to make available to their eligible employees a payroll deposit individual retirement account (IRA) arrangement (automatic IRA arrangement) which grants such employees the right to opt-out of participation; (2) require the Secretary of the Treasury to provide employers with a model notice for notifying employees of automatic IRS arrangements and to establish a program to assist employers in the implementation of such arrangements; (3) allow employers who do not have more than 100 employees a tax credit for costs associated with establishing an automatic IRA arrangement; (4) impose a penalty on employers who fail to provide eligible employees access to automatic IRA arrangements; and (5) increase the tax credit for small employer pension plan start-up costs. Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Labor to jointly conduct feasibility studies on extending spousal consent requirements to automatic IRAs, promoting the use of low-cost lifetime income arrangements, and using investment data to notify individuals with multiple small balance retirement accounts of consolidation options."
