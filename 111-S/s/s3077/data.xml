  <summary>3/4/2010--Introduced.
Secure Visas Act - Amends the Homeland Security Act to grant the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) (Secretary), except for the Secretary of State's authority with respect to diplomatic- and international organization-related visas, exclusive authority to issue regulations, establish policy, and administer and enforce the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and all other immigration or nationality laws relating to U.S. consular officer visa functions. Authorizes the Secretary to refuse or revoke any visa to an alien or class of aliens if necessary or advisable for U.S. security interests. Prohibits judicial review of such determinations. Provides that any such visa revocation shall become effective immediately and cancel any other visa in an alien's possession. Authorizes the Secretary of State to direct a consular officer to refuse or revoke a visa if necessary or advisable for U.S. foreign policy interests. Prohibits a decision by the Secretary of State to approve a visa from overriding a revocation or refusal determination by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to review on-site all visa applications and supporting documentation before adjudication at visa-issuing posts in Algeria, Canada, China, Colombia, Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in Israel, Jordan, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Venezuela, and Yemen. Authorizes the Secretary to assign DHS employees to such posts. States that if the Secretary or the Secretary of State revokes a visa: (1) the relevant consular, law enforcement, and terrorist screening databases shall be immediately updated; and (2) look-out notices shall be posted to all DHS port inspectors and Department of State consular officers. Amends INA to eliminate the exception permitting judicial review of a visa revocation where such revocation is the sole ground for a deportation process based upon an alien's unlawful presence in the United States.</summary>
