Conditions initiation of such project on the state of Louisiana agreeing to: (1) pay all costs arising from the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation of each completed project component; and (2) hold the U.S. harmless from any claim or damage that may arise from carrying out the project, except with regard to the federal government's negligence."
