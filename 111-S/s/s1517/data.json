    "text": "Domestic Energy Security Act of 2009 - Amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to: (1) prohibit the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) from offering, until June 30, 2022, any oil and gas exploration lease in the Eastern Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico that is within 45 miles of the coastline of Florida. (The current leasing moratorium prohibits leasing activities within 125 miles of such coastline.) Authorizes the Secretary to offer for leasing specified areas currently under moratorium. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to: (1) instruct the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to recommend to the President whether certain areas of the outer Continental Shelf (OCS) should remain under energy exploration restrictions; and (2) authorize the DOD Secretary to offer for leasing any areas made available for leasing under this Act. Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit specified OCS revenues into a special account in the Treasury for disbursement to Gulf producing states. Prescribes revenue sharing from OCS areas in certain coastal states, including coastal political subdivisions of states and areas in the Alaska Adjacent Zone. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to require oil transportation by pipeline in Arctic waters. Authorizes: (1) all transactions necessary for hydrocarbon exploration and extraction from any foreign Exclusive Economic Zone contiguous to the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone; and (2) exportation without license authority of all equipment necessary for hydrocarbon exploration or extraction. Amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize under a general license specified travel-related transactions for travel to, from, or within Cuba in connection with hydrocarbon resources exploration in any part of a foreign maritime Exclusive Economic Zone that is contiguous to the United States' Exclusive Economic Zone."
