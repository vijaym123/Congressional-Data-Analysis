Establishes in the Treasury the United States Nuclear Fuel Management Corporation Fund. Directs the President to appoint a Transition Manager to transfer spent nuclear fuel management obligations, functions, personnel, and funds from the Secretary of Energy to the Corporation. Designates the Corporation the exclusive marketing agent on behalf of the United States for entering into contracts to provide spent nuclear fuel management and related products and services."
