Requires a state, in developing and implementing such a system, to: (1) identify corrosion mitigation and prevention methods to preserve its highway bridges; (2) establish a project maintenance program to extend the life of such bridges; and (3) ensure that maintenance individuals are qualified and all highway bridge engineers and inspectors implementing the system are trained, and certified by the state, in corrosion mitigation and prevention techniques.
