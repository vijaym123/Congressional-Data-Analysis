States that if an employer provides a notice of a mass layoff after the approval of a visa any visas approved during the most recent 12-month period for such employer shall expire 60 days after the date on which such notice is provided and shall not be subject to judicial review. Exempts an employer from such requirements if the employer certifies to the Secretary of Labor that the total number of the employer's workers who are U.S. citizens working in the United States will not be reduced by a mass layoff."
