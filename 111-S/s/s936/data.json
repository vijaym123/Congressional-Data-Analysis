Authorizes appropriations for sewer overflow control grants for FY2010-FY2014 and sets forth provisions governing the allocation of such funds to states and munipalities. Establishes a December 31, 2010, deadline for the Administrator's report to Congress on recommended funding levels for sewer overflow control grants."
