Requires the analysis to compare indexed changes in the average price of consumer grade propane to all end users to an equally weighted composite of indexed changes in the price of residential electricity, residential natural gas, and refiner price to end users of No. 2 fuel oil on an annual national average basis. (Currently, the comparison is to be made of indexed changes in the price of consumer grade propane to a composite of indexed changes in the price of residential electricity, residential natural gas, and refiner price.) Directs the Secretary of Commerce, within 60 days after enactment of this Act, to prepare and make available to the public an updated propane price analysis reflecting the amendment made by this Act."
