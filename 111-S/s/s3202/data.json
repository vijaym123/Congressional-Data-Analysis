States that: (1) a grant agreement between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Fund shall require the Fund to liquidate its assets and dissolve not later than December 31, 2020, unless USAID determines that the Fund should be extended; and (2) all Fund assets remaining at such time shall be used to organize a follow-on U.S.-Haiti legacy foundation. Applies the enterprise fund provisions of the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 to the Fund in the same manner as such provisions apply to other similar U.S.-established enterprise funds. Authorizes appropriations."
