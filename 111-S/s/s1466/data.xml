Requires the USTR, with respect to a priority foreign country trade practice, to initiate: (1) dispute settlement consultations in the World Trade Organization (WTO); (2) dispute settlement consultations under any bilateral or regional trade agreement to which the United States is a party; (3) an investigation to determine whether the priority foreign country trade practice violates the rights of the United States under a trade agreement or is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce; (4) negotiations that seek an agreement for the elimination of the priority foreign country trade practice or, if elimination is not feasible, an agreement that provides for compensatory trade benefits; or (5) any other action to eliminate the priority foreign country trade practice. Establishes within the Office of the USTR the position of Chief Manufacturing Negotiator. Requires the Deputy USTR for Trade Enforcement to submit to Congress a plan to address nontariff barriers to market access by U.S. companies in a country in cases where the United States has entered into, or is negotiating, a bilateral or regional trade agreement with such country.
