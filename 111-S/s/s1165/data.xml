Promoting Health Care Purchasing Cooperatives Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), to award grants for the development of health care purchasing cooperatives by two or more self-insured employers. Sets forth requirements for cooperatives, including that they: (1) are nonprofit, wholly owned, and democratically governed by their member-employers; (2) exist solely to serve the membership base; (3) assist members in pooling their health care insurance purchasing power; (4) provide data to improve the ability of the members to make data-based decisions regarding their health plans; and (5) conduct activities to enhance quality improvement in the health care community. Requires the Secretary to carry out an identical grant program for eligible groups consisting of a consortium of two or more employers that each: (1) have 99 employees or fewer; and (2) purchase health insurance for their employees.</summary>
