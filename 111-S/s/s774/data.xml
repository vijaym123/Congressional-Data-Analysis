Amends the Energy and Independence and Security Act of 2007 to require the DOE Secretary to guarantee loans for the aggregate purchase of at least 5,000 batteries that use advanced battery technology within a year. Requires the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to investigate whether oil savings goals can be achieved in the trucking industry without adverse safety consequences by determining the safety impacts and other effects of increasing the maximum allowable gross weight for vehicles using the Interstate System to allow for larger, more fuel-efficient tractor-trailers. Requires each automobile manufacturer to ensure that a specified percentage of the automobiles it manufactures are flexible fuel automobiles. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise credits concerning renewable energy, alternative fuels, and electric and hybrid vehicles. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to expand the list of innovative technology projects that are eligible for loan guarantees to include low-carbon technology projects.
