Justice for Survivors of Sexual Assault Act of 2009 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to: (1) require states receiving Edward Byrne Memorial justice assistance grants to certify the implementation of a policy for requiring all rape kits (DNA evidence relating to sexual assault) to be sent to crime laboratories for forensic analysis: (2) adjust the amount of such grants based upon compliance and noncompliance with rape kit backlog reduction requirements under this Act; (3) eliminate rape kit repayment requirements for sexual assault victims; and (4) provide for sexual assault forensic medical personnel examiners to collect and preserve evidence, provide expert testimony, and provide treatment of trauma relating to sexual assault. Amends the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 to: (1) authorize funding to eliminate rape kit backlogs and ensure that DNA analyses of samples from rape kits are carried out in a timely manner; and (2) require states and local governments to adopt performance measures for reducing rape kit backlogs. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the availability of sexual assault nurse examiners and trained examiners at all Indian Health Service facilities operated under contracts.</summary>
