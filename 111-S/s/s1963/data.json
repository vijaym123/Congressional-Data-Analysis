    "date": "2010-05-05", 
    "text": "Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 - Title I: Caregiver Support - (Sec. 101) Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish a program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers of any veteran who: (1) is undergoing medical discharge from the Armed Forces; (2) has a serious injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001; and (3) is in need of personal care services. Includes among such assistance personal care services instruction and training, ongoing technical support, counseling, and lodging and subsistence while accompanying the veteran for VA medical care. Allows additional assistance for the primary personal care provider, including mental health services, respite care, and a monthly stipend comparable to that provided to commercial caregivers in that geographic area. Requires the Secretary, with respect to such assistance, to: (1) designate one family member as the primary personal care provider, subject to approval by the veteran concerned; (2) monitor the well-being of each veteran receiving personal care services, and take corrective actions as necessary; (3) carry out outreach to inform eligible veterans and family members of the program; (4) establish a program of general caregiver support services for caregivers of veterans enrolled in the VA health care system, and provide outreach about that program; (5) develop and submit to the congressional veterans committees a plan for the implementation of the comprehensive assistance program; (6) report annually to such committees on plan implementation; and (7) submit a one-time report on the feasibility and advisability of expanding the program to cover veterans who have a serious injury incurred or aggravated before September 11, 2001. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 102) Authorizes the Secretary to provide VA medical care for a designated primary provider of personal care services who is not entitled to care or services under a health-plan contract. (Sec. 103) Includes family caregivers of veterans among those eligible for VA counseling and mental health services. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to reimburse attendants for travel expenses, including lodging and subsistence, in connection with authorized VA treatment for veterans. Title II: Women Veterans Health Care Matters - (Sec. 201) Requires the Secretary to study, and report to the veterans committees on, barriers to the receipt of comprehensive VA health care encountered by women veterans. Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure that the heads of the Center for Women Veterans and the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans review the study's results; and (2) report to Congress on the study and the status of implementation of this section. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary to: (1) carry out a program of graduate-level education, training, certification, and continuing medical education for mental health professionals specializing in the provision of counseling and care to veterans suffering from sexual trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and (2) report annually to Congress on the counseling and care provided. (Sec. 203) Requires the Secretary to: (1) conduct a two-year pilot program to evaluate the feasibility and advisability of providing reintegration and readjustment services in group retreat settings to women veterans recently separated from military service after a prolonged deployment; and (2) report to Congress on the pilot program. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 204) Requires the inclusion, respectively, of women veterans recently separated from service and minority women veterans recently separated from service on: (1) the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans; and (2) the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. (Sec. 205) Directs the Secretary to: (1) carry out a two-year pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of providing assistance to veterans receiving regular or intensive mental health services and other intensive health care services in order to obtain child care while receiving such services; and (2) report to Congress on the pilot program. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 206) Authorizes the Secretary to furnish care to a newborn child of a woman veteran receiving VA maternity care for up to seven days after the birth of the child. Title III: Rural Health Improvements - (Sec. 301) Revises the VA's education debt reduction program to: (1) add retention as a program purpose; and (2) allow all (under current law, only recently appointed) employees to participate. Increases the aggregate and per-year payment limits under such program. Allows the Secretary to waive such limits for participants who serve in positions for which there is a shortage of qualified employees by reason of either the position's location or requirements. (Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to establish and carry out a scholarship program of financial assistance for individuals who: (1) are accepted for, or currently enrolled in, a program of study leading to a degree or certificate in visual impairment or orientation and mobility, or both; and (2) enter into an agreement to serve, after program completion, as a full-time VA employee for three years within the first six years after program completion. Sets maximum assistance amounts of $15,000 per academic year and $45,000 total. Requires pro rata repayment for failure to satisfy education or service requirements, while allowing the Secretary to waive or suspend repayment when noncompliance is due to circumstances beyond the control of the participant, or when waiver or suspension is in the best interests of the United States. (Sec. 303) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out demonstration projects to examine the feasibility and advisability of alternatives for expanding care for veterans in rural areas. Requires the Secretary to report project results to the veterans and appropriations committees. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 304) Requires the Secretary to establish a program to provide to veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, particularly those who served with the National Guard or reserves: (1) peer outreach services; (2) peer support services; (3) readjustment counseling and related services; and (4) mental health services. Requires the Secretary to establish a program to provide to immediate family members of such veterans, during the three-year period after the veteran's return from such deployment, education, support, counseling, and mental health services to assist in: (1) the veteran's readjustment to civilian life; (2) in the case of a veteran with an injury or illness incurred during such deployment, the recovery of the veteran; and (3) the readjustment of the family following the veteran's return. Directs the Secretary to contract with community mental health centers and other qualified entities in areas not adequately served by other health care facilities or VA vet centers. Requires the appropriate training of veterans and clinicians in the provision of such services. (Sec. 305) Authorizes the Secretary to pay travel expenses for veterans receiving treatment at VA facilities at the rate of 41.5 cents per mile. (Current law authorizes the rate provided to federal employees in connection with the performance of official duties.) Allows the Secretary, one year after the enactment of this Act, to adjust such rate to make it equal to the mileage reimbursement rate for the use of privately-owned vehicles by government employees on official business (requiring a justification to Congress if such adjustment causes a decrease from the previous rate). Includes within such reimbursement travel by air if it is the only practical way to reach a VA facility. Requires the Secretary, in considering whether travel by air is the only practical way, to consider the veteran's medical condition and any other impediments to the use of ground transportation. (Sec. 306) Requires the Secretary to carry out a three-year pilot program on financial incentives for VA physicians who assume and maintain inpatient responsibilities at community hospitals in health professional shortage areas. Directs the Secretary to compensate participating physicians for such responsibilities carried out for which the physician would not otherwise be compensated by the VA. Requires a written agreement between the VA and the physician with respect to compensation amounts. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the pilot program. (Sec. 307) Directs the Secretary to make grants to state veterans service agencies and veterans service organizations to provide innovative transportation options to veterans in highly rural areas. Limits each grant amount to $50,000. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 308) Amends the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 to revise eligibility requirements for participation in a pilot program of enhanced VA contract care for the health care needs of VHA-enrolled veterans residing substantial distances from VA facilities providing primary, acute hospital, and tertiary care. Title IV: Mental Health Care Matters - (Sec. 401) Makes any member who serves in Operations Iraqi Freedom or Enduring Freedom eligible for readjustment counseling and related mental health services through the VHA's Readjustment Counseling Service, regardless of whether the member is on active duty at the time of receipt of such counseling and services. (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary, upon receipt of a request for counseling from an individual who has been discharged or released from active service, to: (1) provide referrals to assist the individual in obtaining mental health care and services outside the VA; and (2) if pertinent, advise such individual of the right to apply for review of the discharge or release. (Sec. 403) Requires the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study to determine the number of veterans who died by suicide between January 1, 1999, and the date of enactment of this Act; and (2) report study results to the veterans committees. Title V: Other Health Care Matters - (Sec. 501) Repeals the requirement for annual reports concerning: (1) pay adjustments for registered nurses; and (2) VA long-range health planning. (Sec. 502) Amends the Persian Gulf War Veterans' Health Status Act to: (1) change the due date of an annual report concerning research on the health effects of military service during the Persian Gulf War; and (2) terminate such report requirement after July 1, 2015.
