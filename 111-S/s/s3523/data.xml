Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on cost share requirements under the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program (the Program). Directs the Secretary, if a state provides financial support to a Center which exceeds 25% of the capital and annual operating and maintenance funds required to create and maintain such Center, to provide that Center, under the State Incentive Program established by this Act, assistance that is in addition to the assistance otherwise provided to it under the Program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015 to carry out: (1) the Program, including the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Advisory Board; (2) the Competitive Grant Program; and (3) the State Incentive Program.</summary>
