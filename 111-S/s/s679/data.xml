  <summary>9/28/2010--Reported to Senate without amendment.
Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a competitive program to provide between three and seven grants of up to $3 million in each of 3 years to advance research and development and to demonstrate technologies, including plug-in hybrid technology, for advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles (vehicles with a gross weight between 14,000 and 33,000 pounds that are fueled, in part, by a rechargeable energy storage system). Requires grant recipients to: (1) conduct research and demonstrate advanced hybrid technology by producing or retrofitting advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles; and (2) demonstrate advanced manufacturing processes and technologies by producing or retrofitting 50 advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. Requires the Secretary: (1) to conduct research into alternative power train designs for use in advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles; and (2) acting through the Department of Energy's (DOE) National Laboratories and Technology Centers, to establish a pilot program to research and test the effects on the domestic electric power grid of the widespread use of plug-in hybrid vehicles, including those that are advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. Amends the United States Energy Storage Competitiveness Act of 2007 to direct the Secretary to conduct an applied research program on energy storage systems to support vehicles with a gross weight over 16,000 pounds.</summary>
