    "text": "Crimes Against Humanity Act of 2010 - Amends the federal criminal code to impose a fine and/or prison term of up to 20 years (or any term of years or for life if death results from a violation of the prohibitions of this Act) on any person who commits or engages in conduct that would violate specified federal criminal laws (including murder, kidnapping, peonage, involuntary servitude, forced labor or trafficking in persons, sex trafficking of children, sexual abuse, hostage taking, torture, extermination, national, ethnic, racial, or religious cleansing, or measures intended to prevent births) as part of a widespread (not less than 50 victims) and systematic attack against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack. Provides for jurisdiction to prosecute a violation of this Act if: (1) the alleged offender is a U.S. national, an alien residing in the United States, or a stateless person whose habitual residence is in the United States; or (2) the offense is committed in whole or in part within the United States. Exempts prosecutions under this Act from any statute of limitations. Prohibits a prosecution for a violation of this Act in the United States unless the Attorney General certifies in writing that: (1) there is no foreign jurisdiction prepared to prosecute a violation of this Act and a prosecution by the United States is in the public interest and necessary to secure substantial justice; and (2) the Secretaries of State and Defense and the Director of National Intelligence do not object to a prosecution. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) make unlawful conduct pursuant to the laws of war; (2) limit or extinguish any otherwise available defense or immunity; (3) support ratification of, or participation by the United States in, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; or (4) repeal or limit the applicability of the American Servcemembers' Protection Act of 2002."
