Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to award border security assistance grants to law enforcement entities located in the Southern Border Region to address drug trafficking, smuggling, and border violence. Directs the President to appoint additional district judges for Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas."
