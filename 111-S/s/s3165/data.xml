  <summary>3/25/2010--Introduced.
Small Business Community Partner Relief Act of 2010 - Amends the Small Business Act relating to the Microloan program (loans to intermediaries to provide small-scale loans to startup, newly-established, and growing small businesses) to authorize the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), at the request of a loan intermediary, to waive the requirement that the intermediary obtain a percentage of the loan amount in cash or in-kind contributions from non-federal sources. Allows such waiver for up to two years. Provides conditions to be considered by the Administrator in determining whether to exercise such waiver, including economic conditions affecting the intermediary as well as the impact the waiver would have on the program. Provides an identical waiver, with the same conditions, with respect to: (1) grants made to intermediaries for small business marketing, management, and technical assistance; and (2) the SBA's women's business center program.</summary>
