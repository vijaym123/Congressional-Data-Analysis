Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make it unlawful for any person in the United States, in connection with any telecommunications service or Internet protocol (IP)-enabled voice service, to cause any caller identification (ID) service to transmit misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value, unless such transmission is exempted in connection with: (1) authorized activities of law enforcement agencies; or (2) a court order specifically authorizing the use of caller ID manipulation. Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as preventing or restricting any person from blocking any caller identification service. Requires a related report by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to Congress. Provides civil and criminal penalties for violations. Allows enforcement by states (with authorized intervention by the FCC). Declares that this Act does not prohibit any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of a law enforcement agency of the United States, a state, or a state's political subdivision, or of a U.S. intelligence agency.</summary>
