Sets forth rules under such provisions of the American Fisheries Act relating to requirements for rebuilding and replacing vessels that are being revised by this Act concerning: (1) recommendations of the North Pacific Council for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area or the Gulf of Alaska; (2) certain catcher vessels; (3) limitations on fishery endorsements; and (4) Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries limitations. Amends the American Fisheries Act with respect to: (1) the exemption of specified vessels; and (2) fishery allowances and the removal of a catcher vessel from the directed pollock fishery."
