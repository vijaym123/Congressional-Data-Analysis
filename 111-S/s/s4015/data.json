    "text": "Public Access to Historical Records Act - Directs the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to establish an official dataset on the historical temperature record. Requires NASA to utilize the raw data related to temperature that is collected by applicable stations and vessels and to quantify the statistical uncertainty of each temperature observation and any subsequent products based on that observation. Requires the gaps that exist in temperature station and temperature reading data to be clearly and fully identified. Creates a panel to assist the Administrator in the establishment of the dataset. Requires the Administrator of NASA, at least once every three years, to contract with an appropriate independent entity to perform a verification and validation of the dataset and requires the publication of any algorithms utilized, and any determinations made, in verifying and validating the dataset. Requires persons and entities engaged in global climate research funded by the federal government to utilize the dataset as a source of data on the historical temperature record. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to provide for the immediate release of: (1) all raw temperature station data from cooperative observers and automated stations collected by the National Climatic Data Center; and (2) an analysis of the differences between raw and final temperature datasets collected by the Center."
