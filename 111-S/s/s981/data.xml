  <summary>5/5/2009--Introduced.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research and Awareness Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to: (1) require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct, support, and expand existing epidemiology research on inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) in both pediatric and adult populations; (2) authorize the CDC to award grants and enter into cooperative agreements to develop and administer such epidemiology research; and (3) direct the CDC to award grants to increase awareness of inflammatory bowel disease among the general public and health care providers. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Directors of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases should support specified research and training goals for inflammatory bowel diseases.</summary>
