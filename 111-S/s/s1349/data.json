Modifies the rules for the home office tax deduction to: (1) allow a deduction for the cost of dealing with patients, clients, or customers even if they are not physically present in the home office; and (2) establish a de minimis exemption for personal use of a home office. Requires the Secretary to ensure that all self-employment tax forms and schedules separately state amounts attributable to real estate taxes, mortgage interest, and depreciation for purposes of the home office tax deduction."
