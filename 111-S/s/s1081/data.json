Prohibits: (1) a court from ordering a covered individual's release into the United States; and (2) the Secretary of State from issuing any visa and the Secretary of Homeland Security from admitting or providing any type of status to a covered individual that permits such individual's entry or admission into the United States. States that a covered individual who is no longer held as an enemy combatant shall be: (1) released into the Secretary of Homeland Security's custody for expeditious transfer to such individual's country of nationality or to another country; and (2) housed separately from aliens detained as enemy combatants in a manner consistent with the safety of U.S. personnel."
