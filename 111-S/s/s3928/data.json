Directs the Secretary and other appropriate federal agencies to enter into agreements to strengthen interagency cooperation on seafood safety, labeling, and fraud, including regarding examining and testing seafood imports, inspections of foreign facilities, establishing a distribution chain tracking system, data sharing, and public outreach. Requires the Secretary, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and heads of other appropriate federal agencies to submit an annual report to Congress concerning the implementation of such agreements and the budget, personnel, and any additional authorities necessary to improve seafood safety and labeling and prevent seafood fraud. Directs the Secretary and the Chairman to submit to Congress a joint report on consumer protection activities, enforcement measures, and coordination efforts with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Requires NOAA to report deceptive seafood marketing and fraud to the FTC. Directs the Secretary to increase the number of laboratories certified to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards. Authorizes the Secretary to increase the number and capacity of laboratories operated by NOAA involved in testing and other activities under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), subject to exceptions, to: (1) refuse imports of seafood originating from certain countries or exporters; and (2) increase the percentage of seafood tested originating from such countries. Authorizes the Secretary to send inspectors to an originating country or exporter to assess seafood practices and processes and to provide technical assistance related to U.S. requirements. Requires the development and publication of an annual list of standardized names to identify seafood at the distribution, marketing, and consumer retail stages."
