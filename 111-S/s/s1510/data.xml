United States Secret Service Uniformed Division Modernization Act of 2010 - (Sec. 1) States as the purpose of this Act to transfer statutory entitlements to pay and hours of work for members of the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division from laws codified in the District of Columbia Official Code to the United States Code.(Sec. 2) Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) fix and adjust basic pay rates for members of the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division; (2) determine what constitutes an acceptable level of competence; (3) establish and determine technician positions at the Officer and Sergeant ranks; and (4) determine the rate of basic pay of a member who is changed or demoted to a lower rank. Sets forth the annual rates of basic pay of members of the Uniformed Division. Limits the pay rates for the Lieutenant, Captain, and Inspector ranks to 95% of the rate of pay for level V of the Executive Schedule. Changes the number of steps per rank to 13.Provides for an adjustment of the schedule of annual rates of basic pay of members (except the Deputy Chiefs, Assistant Chief, and Chief) by the Secretary by a percentage amount corresponding to the percentage adjustment made in rates of pay under the General Schedule. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a methodology of schedule adjustment that: (1) results in uniform fixed-dollar step increments within any given rank; and (2) preserves the established percentage differences among rates of different ranks at the same step position.Makes authorized locality-based comparability payments applicable to the basic pay for all ranks under this Act. Prohibitis locality-based comparability payments from being paid at a rate which, when added to the rate of basic pay otherwise payable to the member, would cause the total to exceed the rate of basic pay for level IV of the Executive Schedule.Authorizes the Director of the Secret Service to hire an officer at a rate above the minimum rate for individuals with superior qualifications.Provides for specified service step adjustments for members whose current performance is at an acceptable level of competence.Requires each member whose position is determined to be included as a technician position to receive, in addition to the member's scheduled rate of basic pay, an amount equal to 6% of the sum of such member's rate of basic pay and the applicable locality-based comparability payment.Establishes processes for determining pay rates following a promotion or demotion.Increases the clothing allowance benefit to $500 annually.Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the operation of provisions under this Act, including: (1) an assessment of effectiveness with respect to the Secretary's efforts to recruit and retain well-qualified personnel; and (2) recommendations for appropriate legislation or administrative action.Sets an annual leave limitation for the Division's Deputy Chief, Assistant Chief, and Chief ranks.Prohibits a member of the Division from being charged sick leave for an absence due to work-related injuries and illnesses.(Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to fix the rates of basic pay for members of the Uniformed Division according to a new salary schedule. Requires each member to be placed in and receive basic pay at the specified scheduled rate corresponding with the member's total years of creditable service. Includes in a member's creditable service any police service in pay status with the Uniformed Division, the United States Park Police, or the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department. Entitles a member: (1) who, at the time of conversion, is in step 13 of any rank below Deputy Chief to the greater of the pay rate for step 13 under the new salary schedule or the pay rate for step 14 under the schedule in effect immediately before conversion; and (2) whose former rate of basic pay is greater than the maximum rate of basic pay for the rank of the member's position immediately after the conversion to basic pay at a rate equal to the member's former rate of basic pay, to be increased by 50% of the amount of any increase in the maximum rate of basic pay payable for the rank of the member's position. Deems an employee receiving a rate above the maximum rate as provided under this paragraph to be at step 13 for purposes of applying provisions regarding promotions.Requires each member whose position is converted to the salary schedule under this Act to be granted credit for purposes of such member's first service step adjustment made after conversion to the salary schedule for all satisfactory service performed by the member since that individual's last increase in basic pay before the adjustment under this section.Requires the schedule of rates of basic pay to be increased by the percentage of any annual adjustment applicable to the General Schedule that takes effect during the period beginning on January 1, 2010, through the last day of the last pay period preceding the first pay period which begins after this Act's enactment. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a methodology of schedule adjustment that results in uniform fixed-dollar step increments within any given rank and that preserves the established percentage differences among rates of different ranks at the same step position.Prohibits the conversion of positions and members of the Uniformed Division to appropriate ranks in the salary schedule set forth in this Act from being treated as an increase in the salary of individuals who are members of the Uniformed Division on the date of enactment. Requires any adjustment of rates of basic pay made in accordance with this Act after such conversion to be treated as an increase in the salary of individuals who are members of the Uniformed Division on that date.Provides that nothing in this Act shall affect retirement benefits and pensions of current and former members who have retired under the District of Columbia Police and Firefighter's Retirement and Disability System, except as otherwise provided in this Act. (Sec. 4) Provides that, to the extent that any provision of any law codified in the District of Columbia Official Code that authorizes an entitlement to pay or hours of work for current members of the Uniformed Division is not expressly revoked by this Act, such provision shall not apply to such members after the effective date of this Act.</summary>
