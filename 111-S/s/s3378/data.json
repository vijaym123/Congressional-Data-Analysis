(Sec. 4) Requires the Board to: (1) consider and study cases of such exposure; (2) evaluate submitted exposure claims; and (3) recommend to such Secretaries that either a claim is insufficient to warrant further consideration or is sufficient to warrant health care or compensation. Authorizes the Board to convene a science panel to consider exposure claims and report results to the Board. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to provide to such members and dependents the health care benefits recommended by the Board. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to: (1) compile a list of individuals exposed to environmental hazards at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, during the period in which the water was contaminated with volatile organic compounds, including known and probable human carcinogens; and (2) report to the congressional defense and appropriations committees on the compilation of such list. (Sec. 7) Requires the Secretary to: (1) compile a list of individuals exposed to environmental hazards at Atsugi Naval Air Facility, Japan, during the period in which the air was contaminated due to an incinerator; and (2) report to the above committees on the compilation of such list. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary to report annually to such committees on health care and other benefits provided under this Act. (Sec. 10) Authorizes appropriations."
