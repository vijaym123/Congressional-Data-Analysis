  <summary>2/2/2010--Introduced.
Renewing Hope for Haitian Trade and Investment Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), acting through the Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to commit sufficient CBP resources to: (1) enhance commercial assistance to promote trade among Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the United States; (2) facilitate the preclearance of valid cargo from Haiti to the United States; (3) promote the efficient and secure movement of articles entering the United States under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA); and (4) provide technical assistance and training to Haiti's customs service to improve production validation and compliance and understanding of U.S. customs procedures, such as the Electronic Visa Information System. Amends CBERA to extend, in each succeeding one-year period through FY2013 (transition period), the duty-free treatment of certain imported knit apparel articles made in one or more Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) beneficiary countries from yarns wholly formed in the United States. Extends the value-added rule of origin for certain apparel and other textile articles imported from Haiti. Extends, for the initial applicable one-year period, and each one-year period thereafter through FY2022, the duty-free treatment of apparel articles imported directly into the United States from Haiti or the Dominican Republic in amounts not to exceed specified percentages of the aggregate square meter equivalents of all apparel articles imported into the United States in the most recent 12-month period. Extends, through December 20, 2013, the preferential treatment of wire harness automotive components manufactured in Haiti and imported into the United States, provided Haiti meets certain economic and political eligibility requirements. Establishes the Haiti Recovery and Investment Task Force to promote foreign investment in Haiti. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the effectiveness of the trade preferences provided under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity Through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 (HOPE Act), as amended, as well as recommendations for improving such preferences.</summary>
