  <summary>2/11/2010--Introduced.
Iran Democratic Transition Act of 2010 - Authorizes the President to support a transition to a freely elected democratic government in Iran by providing eligible Iranian democratic opposition organizations with assistance for the communication and dissemination of accurate and independent information to the Iranian people through various media. Urges the President to fully utilize specified existing authorities and funding to: (1) support democracy in Iran through assistance for pro-democracy broadcasting into Iran and the dissemination of accurate and independent information to the Iranian people through various media; and (2) provide humanitarian assistance to individuals or groups determined by the President to be victims of repression by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Prohibits assistance to any organization or individual that has: (1) engaged in military cooperation with the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran; or (2) engaged in or supported terrorism. Authorizes the President to appoint a Special Envoy for Democracy and Human Rights in Iran whose primary responsibility shall be to manage U.S. policy on the promotion of democracy and human rights in Iran. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the U.S. government should explore the possibility of a regional human rights dialogue on Iran that is modeled on the Helsinki process; and (2) if the Iranian people restore democratic rule to Iran the United States should provide humanitarian and democratic transition assistance to the Iranian people and to democratic parties and movements.</summary>
