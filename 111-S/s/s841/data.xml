  <summary>1/4/2011--Public Law.
Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to initiate a rulemaking to promulgate a phased-in motor vehicle safety standard: (1) establishing performance requirements for an alert sound that allows blind and other pedestrians to detect a nearby electric or hybrid vehicle operating below the cross-over speed, if any; and (2) requiring such vehicles to provide an alert sound conforming to established standard requirements. Prescribes requirements for such standards. Prohibits requiring either driver or pedestrian activation of the alert sound. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on whether there is a safety need to apply such standard to conventional motor vehicles. Requires the allocation of certain funds to the Administrator of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to carry out this rulemaking.</summary>
