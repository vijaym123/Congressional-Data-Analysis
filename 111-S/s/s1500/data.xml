  <summary>7/22/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to prohibit schools and service institutions that participate in the School Lunch program or the School Breakfast program, under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, from serving food that contains trans fats. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) give such schools and service institutions five years to phase-out trans-fatty foods; (2) establish a process for granting hardship waivers to schools or service institutions that face difficulties in meeting such deadline due to contractual obligations or significant financial hardship; and (3) prepare guidance to assist schools and service institutions in transitioning from trans-fatty to healthy oils.</summary>
