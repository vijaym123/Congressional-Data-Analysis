  <summary>12/9/2009--Public Law.
Airline Flight Crew Technical Corrections Act - Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 with respect to the hours-of-service requirement airline flight crews must meet to be eligible for leave under such Act. Declares that a flight attendant or flight crewmember will be considered to meet such requirement if he or she has worked or been paid for: (1) at least 60% of the applicable total monthly guarantee, or the equivalent for the previous 12-month period for or by the employer with respect to whom such leave is requested; and (2) a minimum of 504 hours (not counting personal commute time spent on vacation leave or medical or sick leave) during such period. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to provide, by regulation, a method for calculating such leave for airline flight crews.</summary>
