Requires the Secretary to: (1) annually implement one or more authorized forest and watershed restoration projects on the eligible lands; and (2) implement in, one or more certain watershed areas, those projects that provide landscape-scale work in order to minimize entries into the watershed or watersheds; and (3) enter into stewardship contracts or agreements to carry out authorized forest and watershed restoration projects. Designates specified lands administered by the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Montana as wilderness areas and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS). Releases: (1) certain BLM wilderness study areas from further study for designation as wilderness; and (2) the Sapphire and West Pioneer Wilderness Study Areas from further study for inclusion as components of the NWPS.
