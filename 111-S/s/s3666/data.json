Directs: (1) the Attorney General and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to implement a system to enable Department of State personnel responsible for such passport activities to have real-time access to the criminal history information contained in the National Crime Information Center's Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III) in order to verify passport applicant identity or to detect passport fraud; and (2) the Secretary of State to designate such Department personnel. Directs the Secretary to conduct an analysis and report to Congress to determine: (1) if U.S. passport applicants or renewals should provide biometric identification information; and (2) if technology should be employed to verify identity documents."
