  <summary>8/6/2009--Introduced.
Long-Term Care Insurance Consumer Right-to-Know Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to review and describe, and report to Congress on: (1) disclosure requirements for long-term care insurance policies under the long-term care insurance model regulation and Act promulgated by NAIC (as adopted as of October 2000 and December 2006); (2) disclosure requirements for long-term care insurance policies under state laws; (3) differences in long-term care services, providers, and settings among states; and (4) key issues to consider in the development of a proposed model form for marketing long-term care insurance policies. Directs the Secretary to request NAIC to: (1) establish a Working Group to develop and issue a model disclosure form for marketing long-term care insurance policies; and (2) amend the model regulation and Act to require the use of such form. Requires: (1) the Secretaries of the Treasury and HHS to promulgate regulations requiring issuers of a qualified long-term care insurance contract under certain tax-qualified or Medicaid Partnership policies to use such form for marketing such contracts; and (2) each state to require any issuer of a long-term care insurance policy to use such form when marketing such a policy in the state.</summary>
