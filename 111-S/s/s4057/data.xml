  <summary>12/22/2010--Introduced.
State Leadership in Health Care Act - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to allow states to apply for a waiver of specified requirements under PPACA with respect to health insurance coverage within that state due to implementation of a state plan that provides comparable coverage for plan years beginning in 2014 (currently, 2017).. Permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) or the Secretary of the Treasury to deny waivers only if: (1) the state plan does not meet requirements for granting a waiver; (2) the Secretary of HHS or Treasury notifies the state in writing of the requirements that the state plan did not meet and provides the state with information used in making such a determination; and (3) the state is given an opportunity to appeal. Requires the Secretary of HHS or Treasury to reconsider the determination in the event of an appeal.</summary>
