Requires the Secretary to select proposals for such cooperative agreements through the use of competitive procedures and an impartial review of their scientific and technical merit, taking into account the efficiency, cost, safety, and proliferation resistance of competing reactor designs. Directs the Secretary to require that a non-federal source provide at least: (1) 50% of the development cost of each small modular reactor design and each early site permit; and (2) 75% of the licensing demonstration costs of each small modular reactor design."
