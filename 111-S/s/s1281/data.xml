Investment in After-School Programs Act of 2009 - Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to award grants to local educational agencies, educational service agencies, community-based organizations, or other entities to improve, expand, or establish rural after-school programs that provide students with a broad array of activities when school is not in session that improve their academic performance and promote their positive development. Requires eligible programs to be implemented in active collaboration with the schools the students attend and take place in safe and easily accessible facilities. Gives priority to applicants that are partnerships between eligible entities or propose to serve students a majority of whom are eligible for free or reduced price meals under the school lunch and breakfast programs.</summary>
