Requires that all the time spent by a resident in outpatient settings be counted towards the determination of full-time equivalency for the purposes of payments for direct graduate (GME) and indirect (IME) medical education costs, without regard to the setting in which the activities are performed, if the hospital continues to incur the costs of the resident's stipends and fringe benefits during the time the resident spends in that setting. Sets forth rules for counting resident time for didactic and scholarly activities and other activities. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a process for the redistribution of residency slots after a hospital closes."
