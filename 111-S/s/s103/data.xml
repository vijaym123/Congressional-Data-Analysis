  <summary>1/6/2009--Introduced.
Amends Rule XXXV (Gifts) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to require a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate to: (1) disclose a flight taken in connection with official duties on an aircraft that is not licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate for compensation or hire (unless it is owned, operated, or leased by a governmental entity); (2) reimburse the aircraft's owner or lessee for the pro rata share of the flight's fair market value; and (3) report to the Secretary of the Senate specified information about the trip, including its purpose and the persons on it (other than the pilot). Declares that the fair market value of noncommercial air travel is the fair market value of the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge for a comparable plane of appropriate size. Amends Rule XXXVIII (Prohibition of Unofficial Office Accounts) to prescribe the value for reimbursement purposes of the use of an aircraft that is not licensed by the FAA to operate for compensation or hire. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to require a principal campaign committee disclosure report of such a flight by a federal office candidate (other than one for President or Vice President). Excludes from the FECA definition of "contribution" any travel expense for such a flight if within seven days the candidate (or the candidate's authorize committee) pays the owner, lessee, or other individual providing the airplane the pro rata share of the flight's fair market value.</summary>
