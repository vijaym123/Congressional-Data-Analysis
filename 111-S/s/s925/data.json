Requires a report on the results of the product testing to be submitted to Congress and made public. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, to establish good manufacturing practices for the cosmetics industry for each impurity or contaminant for which contaminants or impurities may be reduced or eliminated by switching to alternate ingredients or for which manufacturing processes or practices may reduce or eliminate impurities from raw materials. Deems a cosmetic to be adulterated if the manufacture of such cosmetic is not in compliance with good manufacturing practices regulations."
