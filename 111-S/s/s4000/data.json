Requires OPM to redetermine the postal surplus or supplemental liability as of the close of FY2010 and for each year thereafter through FY2043. Provides that if the result for a fiscal year is a surplus, that amount shall remain in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund until distribution is authorized as follows:(1) if there is a surplus as of the close of FY2010-FY2016, such amount or any part of it may be transferred to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund; (2) if there is a surplus as of the close of FY2017 and each year thereafter, such amount or any part of it may be transferred to such Fund to pay any liability of such Fund; and (3) if all liability to such Fund is paid, amounts may be transferred to the Employees' Compensation Fund or to USPS for repayment of any obligation issued by it.
