Suspends such point of order upon certification by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that the legislation does not cause such actions. Permits waiver or suspension of such prohibition, or successful appeals from rulings of the Chair, only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Senate."
