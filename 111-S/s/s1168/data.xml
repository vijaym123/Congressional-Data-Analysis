Amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (the Act), with respect to the Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program, to: (1) include under the definition of "battlefield report" the document titled "Report to Congress on the Historic Preservation of Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Sites in the United States"; (2) authorize grants to eligible entities to pay the federal share of the cost of acquiring eligible sites for the preservation and protection of those sites; (3) permit eligible entities to acquire eligible sites using such grants in partnership with nonprofit organizations; (4) require the non-federal share of the total cost of acquisition of eligible sites to be not less than 50% of the total; and (5) subject acquired eligible sites to the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act's prohibition against conversion to other than public outdoor recreation uses without the Secretary's approval. Requires acquisitions of lands or interests under the Act to be from willing sellers only. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Program, to submit to Congress a report on activities carried out under the Act, including: (1) preservation carried out at the battlefields and associated sites identified in the battlefield report; (2) changes in their condition; and (3) other relevant developments related to such battlefields and sites.</summary>
