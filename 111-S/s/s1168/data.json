Requires acquisitions of lands or interests under the Act to be from willing sellers only. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Program, to submit to Congress a report on activities carried out under the Act, including: (1) preservation carried out at the battlefields and associated sites identified in the battlefield report; (2) changes in their condition; and (3) other relevant developments related to such battlefields and sites."
