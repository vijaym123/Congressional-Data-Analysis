Amends the Federal Power Act to grant FERC emergency authority to change or suspend temporarily the rates, terms, or conditions of service on file with it before providing public notice and an opportunity for comment. Limits such temporary change or suspension to a period of not more than 30 days unless certain conditions are met."
