(Colonel Charles Young was a distinguished African-American officer in the U.S. Army, a pioneer of techniques in military intelligence, as well as a commander of troops in combat in the Spanish-American War and the Mexican expedition against Pancho Villa.) Requires the Secretary to: (1) evaluate architectural and archaeological resources of the Home; (2) consider other alternatives for the preservation, protection, and interpretation of the Home, including the use of shared management agreements with the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park or specific units of such Park; (3) consult with the Ohio Historical Society, Central State University, Wilberforce University, and other interested parties; and (4) identify cost estimates for any federal acquisition, development, interpretation, operation, and maintenance associated with the alternatives considered. Requires the Secretary to report study results to Congress, as well as any conclusions and recommendations."
