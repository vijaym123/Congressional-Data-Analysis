  <summary>7/28/2010--Introduced.
National Monument Designation Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 - Amends the Antiquities Act of 1906 to require land reserved as part of a national monument to be confined to the smallest area necessary to ensure the proper care and management of the objects to be protected by the monument. Sets forth requirements for the designation of national monuments under the Act. Bars the President from issuing a proclamation to designate a national monument under this Act before the date that is 30 days after the date on which the proposed proclamation is provided by the President to Congress, the governor of each state, and specified local and tribal government officials having jurisdiction over any parcel of land within the boundary of the proposed monument. Requires at least one public hearing and a notice and comment period after the issuance of a proclamation to designate a national monument. Requires the President to report to Congress on any hearings held, any written comments received, and the impact of such designation on communities within the boundary of the monument, the nation's energy security, and interests, rights, and uses associated with the land within the monument. Makes a proclamation ineffective two years after its issuance, unless it is approved by an Act of Congress. Bars the issuance of a proclamation by the President that is substantially similar to a previously issued proclamation that Congress did not approve within the two-year period.</summary>
