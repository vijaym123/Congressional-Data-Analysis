Defines "STEM" as the academic and professional disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Directs such committee to: (1) encourage the teaching of innovation and entrepreneurship as part of STEM education activities; (2) develop, implement, and update every five years a five-year STEM education strategic plan which shall specify and prioritize annual and long-term objectives; and (3) establish, periodically update, and maintain an inventory of federally sponsored STEM education programs and activities, including documentation of assessments of the effectiveness of such programs and activities and rates of participation by underrepresented minorities and persons in rural areas. Requires the Director to annually report to Congress on the STEM education strategic plan. (Sec. 102) Requires the establishment or designation of a Committee on Technology under National Science and Technology Council which shall be responsible for planning and coordinating federal programs and activities in advanced manufacturing research and development. Requires the Committee to: (1) establish goals and priorities for advanced manufacturing research and development that will strengthen U.S. manufacturing; (2) reduce federal and state governmental regulatory, logistical, and fiscal barriers that inhibit U.S. manufacturing; (3) facilitate the transfer of intellectual property and technology based on federally supported university research into commercialization and manufacturing; (4) identify technological, market, or business challenges that may best be addressed by public-private partnerships and that are likely to attract participation and primary funding from industry; (5) encourage the formation of such partnerships to respond to those challenges for transition to U.S. manufacturing; and (6) develop a strategic plan to guide federal programs and activities in support of advanced manufacturing research and development. Requires the Director of OSTP to transmit the strategic plan and the subsequent updates to Congress. (Sec. 103) Establishes a working group under National Science and Technology Council to coordinate federal science agency research and policies related to the dissemination and long-term stewardship of the results of unclassified research supported by funding from federal science agencies having an annual extramural research expenditure of over $100 million.
