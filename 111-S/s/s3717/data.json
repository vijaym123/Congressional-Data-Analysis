Declares that for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA): (1) the SEC is an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; and (2) any entity for which the SEC is the responsible regulator, supervisor, or examiner under such Act is a financial institution. (Thus retains the general exemption from FOIA of matters contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of the SEC and any other agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.) Amends the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act to repeal similar prohibitions against compelling the SEC to disclose records or information provided to it by a registered investment company or investment adviser, or an underwriter, broker, dealer, or investment adviser that is a majority-owned subsidiary of such a company, for SEC use in furtherance of certain purposes, including surveillance, risk assessments, or other regulatory and oversight activities."
