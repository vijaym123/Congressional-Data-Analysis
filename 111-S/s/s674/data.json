Requires: (1) new supervisors to complete such programs within one year after appointment, and (2) supervisors to complete the training programs every three years. Requires: (1) the Director of OPM to issue guidance to federal agencies on competencies supervisors are expected to meet in order to effectively manage, and be accountable for managing, the performance of employees; and (2) agencies to use such guidance to assess the performance and overall capacity of its supervisors."
