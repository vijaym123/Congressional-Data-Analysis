Small Business Jobs Preservation Act of 2010 - Amends federal bankruptcy law to prescribe requirements for reorganization of a small business enterprise debtor. Prescribes components of the reorganization plan, including: (1) appointment and duties of the bankruptcy trustee; (2) rights and powers of a debtor in possession; (3) removal of debtor in possession; (4) property of the estate in bankruptcy; (5) a debtor's duties and reporting requirements; (6) filing and contents of the reorganization plan; (7) deemed acceptance of a plan by a holder of a claim or interest; (8) a status conference and confirmation of the reorganization plan; (9) discharge and modification of the reorganization plan; and (10) trustee retention and distribution of payments and funds. States that a person is not disqualified for employment as an attorney, accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or other professional by a small business enterprise debtor solely because such person holds a claim of less than $5,000 that arose before commencement of the case.</summary>
