Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act - Amends the federal judicial code to: (1) expand the liability of foreign states for tortious acts committed against U.S. citizens during a terrorist act and allow civil actions against a foreign state that are now pending or that were dismissed to proceed in accordance with such expanded liability; and (2) impose liability on a foreign state for the acts or omissions of its officials or employees while acting within the scope of their office or employment. Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) impose liability on any person who aids and abets an act of international terrorism, provides material support or resources to terrorist organizations, or conspires with terrorists; (2) grant U.S. district courts personal jurisdiction over such persons; (3) remove the prohibition against bringing a civil action against foreign states or foreign officials for damages related to acts of terrorism; (4) extend from 4 to 10 years the limitation period for bringing an action for civil damages resulting from an act of international terrorism; and (5) allow previously time-barred cases to be refiled within 90 days of the enactment of this Act.</summary>
