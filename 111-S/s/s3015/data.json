Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations to establish a federal certification program for employees and contractors who carry out state public transportation safety program activities in compliance with this Act. Delineates requirements for state preemption of federal law with respect to public transportation safety. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out certain public transportation safety program activities, including inspection and testing of public transportation systems and accident prevention and investigation. Allows a state to establish a state public transportation safety program that complies with federal regulations and policies issued by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants or enter into agreements to carry out such state programs, including to: (1) train employees to administer the program; and (2) enforce federal and state public transportation safety laws and regulations. Grants the Secretary enforcement authority for violations of public transportation safety, including alcohol and controlled substances testing. Authorizes the Secretary immediately, without regard to ordinary administrative procedure, to order restrictions and prohibitions to abate an emergency situation."
