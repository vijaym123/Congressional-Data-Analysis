Requires states receiving grants under this Act to use the National Incident-Based Reporting System to report crimes against children. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop model training and caseload standards for child guardians in child abuse and neglect cases. Mynisha's Law - Authorizes a local or tribal government to apply to the Attorney General for designation as a high intensity gang activity area. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish criteria for reviewing such applications; and (2) establish an Interagency Gang Prevention Task Force to coordinate federal assistance to such high intensity gang activity areas. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow the use of school security grants for: (1) the placement of surveillance equipment in schools; and (2) the establishment of hotlines or tiplines for reporting potentially dangerous students and situations. Establishes an interagency task force to develop advisory school safety guidelines."
