  <summary>3/22/2010--Reported to Senate amended.
Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act of 2010 - Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to states, local and territorial governments, or Indian tribes to: (1) analyze and improve the cost-effectiveness of spending on prisons, jails, and community corrections; and (2) implement policies, programs, or practices to help control growth in spending on corrections and increase public safety. Requires the Inspector General of the Department of Justice (DOJ), beginning in FY2012, to conduct annual audits of not less than 10% of all grantees receiving funds under this Act to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Denies continued funding to a grant recipient who has an unresolved audit. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) report to the Judiciary Committees of Congress on November 1 of each year concerning the development and implementation of grants and strategies developed under this Act; (2) establish an information clearinghouse for data collected and best practices developed by grant recipients; and (3) ensure equitable distribution of grants among geographical regions and between urban and rural populations, including Indian tribes. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015. Limits expenditures for salaries and DOJ administrative expenses to 5% of funds authorized.</summary>
