Defines \"serious human rights offenses\" to include genocide, torture, war crimes, and the use or recruitment of child soldiers. Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) to punish a conspiracy to commit genocide in the same manner as completed act of genocide; (2) eliminate the limitation period for prosecuting crimes of genocide; and (3) include genocide and recruitment of child soldiers as predicates for the crime of providing material support to terrorists. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to broaden the basis for rendering aliens participating in genocide inadmissible."
