  <summary>3/23/2010--Introduced.
No Pay Raise for Congress Until the Budget is Balanced Act - Eliminates automatic cost of living adjustments (COLAs) for Members of Congress during FY2011 or any succeeding fiscal year, until the fiscal year following the first fiscal year that the annual federal budget deficit is $0. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) determine whether or not the annual federal budget deficit was $0 for that fiscal year, and if so, report that determination to Congress; and (2) report that determination also to the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, as well as whether or not such COLA restriction shall apply to the succeeding fiscal year. Rescinds $100 million in unobligated balances of funds made available under the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2010, except for any Capitol Police account. Prohibits the availability of such funds for any pilot program for mailings of postal patron postcards by Senators to provide notice of a town meeting by a Senator in a county or local government at which he or she will personally attend. Rescinds $9.2 billion in discretionary, unexpired funds out of all available unobligated federal funds. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) identify the accounts and amounts rescinded to implement this Act; and (2) report to the Secretary of the Treasury and Congress on them.</summary>
