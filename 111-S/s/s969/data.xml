  <summary>5/5/2009--Introduced.
Women's Health Insurance Fairness Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit health insurance issuers offering individual health insurance coverage from: (1) considering the gender of an enrollee when determining premium; (2) imposing any preexisting condition exclusion relating to pregnancy; or (3) otherwise discriminating against women on the basis of a current or past pregnancy, past or future method of delivery, and past pregnancy outcome. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) develop a minimum benefit standard for the provision of comprehensive maternity coverage under an individual health plan, which shall require coverage for the full scope of maternity services from preconception through postpartum; and (2) require health insurance issuers to provide data to the Secretary to monitor compliance. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the appropriate congressional committees on health insurance coverage offered on the individual insurance market and on problems remaining for women after the enactment of this Act.</summary>
