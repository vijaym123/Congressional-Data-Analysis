Prohibits any person from entering into a federal oil or gas lease or contract after enactment of this Act unless the person pays into the Fund, or posts a bond, in an amount equal to the difference between: (1) the total of the outstanding liability of the person under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and any removal costs incurred by or on behalf of the person, with respect to any incident for which the person has outstanding liability; and (2) the outstanding balance in the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that is attributable to the person. Requires repayment of unexpended funds (plus interest) upon the earlier of either five years after amounts were paid by the person into the Fund or the date on which the Secretary determines that all federal and state natural resource damage assessments and all outstanding civil claims relating to the incident for which the amounts were paid have been satisfied. Establishes as a separate item, for purposes of the President's budget submission, a statement that includes the estimated amount of Fund deposits, obligations, and outlays."
