    "text": "Justice for Sergei Magnitsky Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of State to publish a list of each individual the Secretary believes: (1) is responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky; (2) conspired to defraud the Russian Federation of taxes on corporate profits through fraudulent transactions and lawsuits against the foreign investment company known as Hermitage and to misappropriate Hermitage-owned entities; or (3) participated in efforts to conceal Mr. Magnitsky's detention, abuse, or death, or the existence of such conspiracy. Makes an alien on such list or a family member ineligible to enter or be admitted to the United States. Revokes any visa issued for such person. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such prohibition if in the U.S. national interest. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) instruct domestic financial institutions and agencies to take specified measures if the Secretary makes a money laundering determination relating to such conspiracy; and (2) freeze and prohibit U.S. property transactions of an individual who is on such list or acts as an agent for an individual on the list. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such actions if in the U.S. national interest. States that this Act shall cease to be effective when the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury certify to Congress that: (1) the government of the Russian Federation has conducted a thorough and transparent investigation into Mr. Magnitsky's detention and death, and the related conspiracy: (2) the responsible individuals have been brought to justice according to the Russian Federation's laws and pursuant to its international legal obligations; and (3) the government of the Russian Federation has taken steps to bring its criminal justice and penal systems into compliance with international legal standards, has strengthened statutory protections for individuals who disclose evidence of illegal government activities, and has recognized Sergei Magnitsky's contribution to the fight against corruption and for the rule of law."
