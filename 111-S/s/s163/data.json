Amends the PROTECT Act to terminate the Child Safety Pilot Program on the date the program established under this Act is operating and able to enroll any organization using that Program.Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish an applicant processing center to streamline the process of obtaining nationwide background checks; (2) enter into an agreement with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to establish a criminal history resource center to provide child-serving organizations with reliable and accurate information for interpreting criminal histories; and (3) assess annually the compliance of state criminal background check programs with requirements of this Act.Sets forth the duties of applicant processing centers, procedures for requesting a nationwide criminal background check, and fee schedules for background checks. Grants individuals who are the subject of a background check the right to request full criminal history reports and to challenge the accuracy and completeness of such reports.Grants limited immunity to child-serving organizations and NCMEC for acts and omissions in obtaining or using criminal history background information. Prohibits unauthorized disclosure or use of criminal history records."
