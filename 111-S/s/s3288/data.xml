Requires wholesalers of tobacco products to obtain permits for selling or exporting tobacco products. Establishes new criminal offenses relating to the distribution of tobacco products. Increases the civil penalty for tobacco-related infractions from $1,000 to $10,000. Establishes in the Treasury the Anti-Contraband Tobacco Trafficking Fund to finance the enforcement provisions of this Act and other laws relating to contraband or illegal tobacco products using the increased civil and criminal fines provided by this Act.
