    "text": "United States Information and Communications Enhancement Act of 2009 or the U.S. ICE Act of 2009 - Replaces two subchapters of federal law on information security with provisions to establish in the Executive Office of the President the National Office for Cyberspace (Office) to serve as the principal office for coordinating an assured, reliable, secure, and survivable global information and communications infrastructure and related capabilities. Requires the Office's director to develop and implement a comprehensive national cyberspace strategy. Authorizes the Office, not withstanding any provision of law or policy, to direct the sponsorship of security clearances for federal officers and employees whose responsibilities involve critical national security infrastructure. Requires the Office to: (1) oversee the implementation of policies, standards, and guidelines on information security; and (2) require agencies to identify and provide appropriate information security protections. Makes the head of each agency responsible for providing appropriate information security protections. Requires each agency to have an annual independent information security effectiveness evaluation. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to prescribe guidelines and compulsory standards for information systems, including national security systems. Allows the President to disapprove or change the guidelines and standards. Allows the Office and the head of an agency to use more stringent standards. Requires each agency to coordinate with the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Allows US-CERT's director, notwithstanding any law or policy, to direct the sponsorship of the security clearances for federal officers and employees whose responsibilities involve critical national security infrastructure. Requires the components of each executive branch department or agency (except the Department of Defense or any such component performing any national security function) to establish an automated reporting mechanism allowing its chief information security officer and security operations center at the agency level to implement and monitor the component's security policies, procedures, and controls."
