    "text": "Federal Tobacco Act of 2009 - Establishes the Tobacco Regulatory Agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but not as part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sets forth criteria by which tobacco products are deemed adulterated or misbranded. Establishes limits on tobacco product advertising, promotion, and marketing related to youth, including: (1) prohibiting the use of any cartoon; (2) restricting the use of any human image; (3) prohibiting sponsorship of certain athletic events; and (4) limiting the sale of small packages of cigarettes. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to reduce federal substance abuse grants for states that: (1) do not have in effect a statute setting forth specific provisions to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors; or (2) spend less than the recommended amount of tobacco settlement agreement funds on tobacco control programs. Prohibits the use of certain descriptors in the packaging and advertising of cigarettes. Requires an approved application under this Act for any reduced-exposure or reduced-risk claim. Directs the Administrator of the Agency to establish standards and procedures for ranking tobacco products and nicotine-containing products based on the relative risks of serious or chronic tobacco-related diseases and adverse health conditions. Requires tobacco product manufacturers to publicly disclose a list of the ingredients in each of their tobacco products. Establishes testing and reporting requirements for tobacco products to determine nicotine and tar yields. Sets forth provisions governing disclosures on tobacco product packaging. Directs the Administrator to assess an annual user fee on each tobacco product manufacturer."
