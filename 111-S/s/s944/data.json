Requires each Secretary to retain on active duty (for pay and allowances purposes) a reserve member who incurs an injury or illness while on active duty, is being discharged or separated from the Armed Forces, or is being released from active duty, and is not being evaluated in connection with such discharge, separation, or release, until the member is: (1) retired or placed on the temporary disability retired or inactive status list; or (2) determined ineligible for such care or benefits based solely upon the injury or illness. Requires military human resources commands to return to active duty during their evaluation period reserve members who request such option. Encourages the use of local residences by reserve members during such transition periods. Authorizes the use of Defense Health Program funds for reserve members who become ill or injured while on active duty and separate as a result of such illness or injury. Provides for the assignment of Judge Advocate General personnel to assist members of the Armed Forces (members) in connection with the medical discharge process and disability evaluations. Expresses support for access of veterans service organizations to military facilities to provide counseling and services to members."
