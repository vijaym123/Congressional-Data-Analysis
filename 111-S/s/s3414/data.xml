  <summary>5/25/2010--Introduced.
Dietary Supplement Full Implementation and Enforcement Act of 2010 - Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2014 to carry out the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) and other provisions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) that apply to dietary supplements. Requires the allocation of funds appropriated to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for FY2010 for the purpose of enhancing food safety to be expended to effectively and fully implement and enforce DSHEA and other FFDCA provisions that apply to dietary supplements. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2014 for expanded research and development of consumer information on dietary supplements by the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to report to Congress annually on the implementation and enforcement of DSHEA and its amendments. Amends the FFDCA to require the Secretary to publish guidance that clarifies when a dietary supplement ingredient is a new dietary ingredient, when the manufacturer or distributor of a dietary ingredient or dietary supplement should provide the Secretary with safety information, the evidence needed to document the safety of new dietary ingredients, and appropriate methods for establishing the identity of a new dietary ingredient. Requires the Secretary to notify the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) if information in a new dietary ingredient notification is inadequate to establish that a dietary supplement containing such ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe because the ingredient may be, or may contain, an anabolic steroid or an analogue of an anabolic steroid.</summary>
