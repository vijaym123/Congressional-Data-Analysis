Requires the continuation of such coverage for the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on the earlier of September 30, 2011, or the effective date of the extension of dependent coverage under TRICARE to individuals up to the age of 26. Provides for the reenrollment of individuals whose eligibility ceased during the period beginning on June 1, 2010, and ending on the date of enactment of this Act by reason of exceeding such age limit."
