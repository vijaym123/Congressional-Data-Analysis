Child Protection Improvements Act of 2009 - Amends the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to direct the Attorney General to: (1) establish policies and procedures for a program for national criminal history background checks for child-serving organizations; (2) assist such organizations in obtaining access to nationwide background checks; (3) establish procedures for insuring the accuracy of criminal history records; (4) identify individuals convicted of serious misdemeanors or felonies involving children; and (5) collect demographic data relating to individuals and organizations covered by this Act and make reports to Congress on such data. Limits the liability of a child-serving organization for failure to conduct criminal background checks or to take adverse action against employees with a criminal history. Imposes limitations on the disclosure or use of criminal history records. Amends the PROTECT Act to provide for an extension of the Child Safety Pilot Program.</summary>
