Authorizes appropriations to USAID: (1) for labor and environmental capacity building activities relating to the implementation of trade promotion agreements; (2) for programs in the Americas to reduce global warming; (3) to support activities in the Region involving adaptation to, and reduction in the negative impact of, environmental changes brought about by global warming and activities promoting sustainable forest management and reduction of deforestation.
