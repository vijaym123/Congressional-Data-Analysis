    "text": "Division A: Preventing Mortgage Foreclosures - Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 - Title I: Prevention of Mortgage Foreclosures - (Sec. 101) Amends the Housing Act of 1949 with respect to guaranteed rural housing loans to require mortgagees, upon either actual or imminent default of a guaranteed mortgage, to engage in loss mitigation actions as an alternative to foreclosure (including special forbearance, loan modification, pre-foreclosure sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure, support for borrower housing counseling, subordinate lien resolution, and borrower relocation). Permits the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) (Secretary for purposes of this section), for mortgages either in default or facing imminent default, to: (1) authorize the modification of such mortgages; and (2) establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee who agrees to apply the claim amount to payment of a mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence. Permits the Secretary to: (1) authorize compensation to the mortgagee for lost income on monthly mortgage payments due to interest rate reduction; (2) reimburse the mortgagee from a guaranty fund in connection with activities that the mortgagee is required to undertake concerning repayment by the mortgagor of the amount owed to HUD; (3) authorize payments to the mortgagee on behalf of the borrower, under terms defined by HUD; and (4) authorize mortgage modification with terms extended up to 40 years from the modification date. Grants the Secretary authority, upon mortgagee request, to establish a program for assignment to HUD of a guaranteed mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence in or facing imminent default. Prescribes procedures for HUD payment of guarantee, disposition, and loan servicing. Requires the mortgagee already to have modified the mortgage, or to have qualified it for modification sufficient to cure the default and provide for mortgage payments the mortgagor is reasonably able to pay, at interest rates not exceeding current market rates. Authorizes the Secretary to pay the mortgage guaranty, without reduction for any amounts modified, but only upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary of all rights, interest, claims, evidence, and records with respect to the mortgage. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee; (2) act as a Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) issuer, or contract with an entity for such purpose, in order to pool the mortgage into a Ginnie Mae security; or (3) resell the mortgage in accordance with any program established for purchase by the federal government of insured mortgages. (Sec. 102) Revises the requirement that the maturity of any housing loan guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) not be more than 30 years and 32 days. Specifies the maturity of a housing loan at the time of origination. (Sec. 103) Authorizes additional appropriations for FY2010-FY2011 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for: (1) advertising to increase public awareness of mortgage scams and counseling assistance; (2) the Housing Counseling Assistance Program; and (3) personnel at the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. (Sec. 104) Requires the Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) to report jointly to certain congressional committees on the volume of mortgage modifications reported to their agencies. (Sec. 105) Amends the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, with respect to emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes (neighborhood stabilization), to authorize each state that has received certain minimum allocations and has fulfilled certain requirements, to distribute any remaining amounts to areas with homeowners at risk of foreclosure or in foreclosure without regard to the percentage of home foreclosures in such areas.

Requires that the mortgagor has not provided false information (as under current law), but also has not been convicted of fraud under federal or state law during the 10-year period ending upon the insurance of the mortgage. Requires the mortgagor to agree in writing to be liable to repay to the Secretary any direct financial benefit achieved from the reduction of indebtedness on the existing mortgage or mortgages on the refinanced residence which is derived from misrepresentations in required mortgagor certifications and documentation. States that the duty of the mortgagee to ensure that mortgagor is in compliance with the NHA shall be satisfied if the mortgagee makes a good faith effort to determine that the mortgagor has not been convicted of fraud during the specified 10-year period. Prohibits a mortgagor from having a net worth exceeding $1 million as of the date of applying for mortgage insurance.

Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) pay insurance benefits to the mortgagee for loss mitigation actions that provide an alternative to foreclosure of a mortgage that faces imminent default, including support for borrower housing counseling, partial claims, borrower incentives, and preforeclosure sale; and (2) establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee that agrees to apply the claim amount to payment of a mortgage on a one- to four-family residence that is in default or faces imminent default. Authorizes the Secretary to encourage loan modifications for either delinquent mortgages or those facing imminent default through the payment of insurance benefits and assignment of the mortgage to HUD and subsequent mortgage modification approved by the mortgagee. Authorizes the Secretary to provide mortgage insurance following mortgage modification, and subsequently: (1) reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee; (2) act as a Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) issuer in order to pool the mortgage into a GNMA security; or (3) resell the mortgage in accordance with certain federal programs established to purchase insured mortgages; and (4) coordinate standards for interest rate reductions available for loan modification.
