Authorizes the President to waive such requirement upon a certification to Congress that North Korea has taken certain actions regarding: (1) nuclear program and proliferation disclosures; (2) the illegal transfer of missile or nuclear technology; (3) support of international terrorist groups; and (4) prisoner release. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea should be present at all negotiating sessions between the governments of the United States and North Korea."
