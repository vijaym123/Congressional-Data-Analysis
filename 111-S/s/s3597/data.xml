Securing Health for Ocean Resources and Environment Act or the SHORE Act - Title I: Improving National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oil Spill Response, Prevention, and Restoration Capacity - (Sec. 101) Requires the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere to review and report to Congress on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) capacity to respond to oil spills. Requires such review to include: (1) a comparison of oil spill modeling requirements with the state-of-the-art oil spill modeling with respect to near shore and offshore areas; (2) the development of recommendations on priorities for improving forecasting of oil spill trajectories and impacts; (3) an inventory of NOAA's products and tools that can aid in assessing the potential risks and impacts of oil spills; (4) an identification of the baseline oceanographic and climate data required to support state-of-the-art modeling; (5) an assessment of Administration's ability to respond to the effects of an oil spill on its trust resources; (6) an assessment of NOAA's capacity to monitor and test seafood for oil contamination resulting from an oil spill; and (7) an identification of resources available to NOAA through partnerships with the private sector and academic institutions that can aid in risk assessment and impacts of oil spills. Requires the Under Secretary to: (1) be responsible for developing and maintaining oil spill trajectory modeling capabilities; (2) create and update once every five years NOAA's environmental sensitivity index products for each coastal area of the United States and for each offshore area that is leased or under consideration for leasing for offshore energy production; (3) submit to Congress, within 270 days and every five years thereafter, a report that, for regions that are leased or are under consideration for leasing for offshore energy production, characterizes ecological baselines, identifies important ecological areas, critical habitats, and migratory behaviors, and identifies potential risks posed by hydrocarbon development on regional, state, and local economies; and (4) review the current state of NOAA's capacity to observe, monitor, map, and track subsea hydrocarbons, including the effect of subsea hyrdocarbons and dispersants at varying concentrations on living marine resources. Requires the Under Secretary to establish a national information center on oil spills that: (1) includes scientific information and research on oil spill preparedness, response, and restoration; (2) serves as a single access point for emergency responders for such scientific data; (3) provides outreach and utilizes communication mechanisms to inform partners, the public, and local communities about the availability of oil spill preparedness, prevention, response, and restoration information and services and improves public understanding and minimizes impacts of oil spills; and (4) applies the data interoperability standards developed by the Integrated Coastal Ocean Observing System to allow for free and open access to all relevant data using the existing infrastructure of the regional information coordinating entities developed as part of the System as a portal for accessing nonfederal data. Requires the Under Secretary to establish an initiative to: (1) determine the significance, response, frequency, size, potential fate, and potential effects, including on sensitive habitats, of oil spills resulting from aging and abandoned oil infrastructure; and (2) formulate recommendations on how best to address such spills. Requires the Under Secretary to develop an inventory of offshore abandoned or sunken vessels in the U.S. exclusive economic zone and identify priorities for potential preemptive removal of oil or other actions that may be effective to mitigate the risk of oil spills from such vessels. (Sec. 102) Amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to revise provisions concerning the uses of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. (Sec. 104) Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to eligible coastal states to: (1) revise management programs and National Estuarine Research Reserves approved under such Act to identify and implement new enforceable policies and procedures to ensure sufficient response capabilities at the state level to address the environmental, economic, and social impacts of oil spills or other accidents resulting from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) energy activities with the potential to affect land or water use or natural resources of the coastal zone; and (2) review and revise enforceable policies within approved coastal state management programs affecting coastal energy activities and energy to ensure that these policies are consistent with such policies and procedures and with emergency response plans and policies developed under federal or state law. Prohibits the Secretary, after an initial grant is made, from making a subsequent grant unless the coastal state is satisfactorily developing revisions to address offshore energy impacts. Provides that no coastal state is eligible to receive grants for more than two fiscal years. Requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance to the coastal states to prepare revisions to approved management programs. (Sec. 105) Requires the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Under Secretary, to: (1) establish and report to Congress on a long-term marine environmental monitoring and research program for the marine and coastal environment of the Gulf of Mexico to ensure that the government has data and information to assess impacts of the oil spill caused by Deepwater Horizon on trust resources (defined as natural resources belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or otherwise controlled by the United States, any state, an Indian Tribe, or a local government); (2) carry out such program during a 10-year period; and (3) make such data and information accessible to the public. Requires the program to include: (1) monitoring and research of the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the affected marine, coastal, and estuarine areas; (2) the fate, transport, and persistence of oil released during the spill and spatial distribution throughout the water column; (3) identification of lethal and sub-lethal impacts to shellfish, fish, and wildlife resources that utilize habitats located within the affected region; and (4) impacts to regional, state, and local economies that depend on the natural resources of the affected area, including commercial and recreational fisheries, tourism, and other wildlife-dependent recreation. (Sec. 106) Requires the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Under Secretary, to direct research to improve the ability of the United States to conduct oil spill prevention, response, observing, and recovery in Arctic waters. Requires such research, observation, and action to include the prioritization of resources to: (1) address ecological baselines and environmental sensitivity indexes, identification of ecological important areas, sensitive habitats, and migratory behaviors, the development of oil spill trajectory models in Arctic marine conditions, the collection of observational data essential for response strategies in the event of an oil spill during both open water and ice-covered seasons, the development of a robust operational monitoring program during such seasons, improvements in technologies and understanding of cold water oil recovery planning and restoration implementation, and the integration of local and traditional knowledge into oil recovery research studies; and (2) establish a robust geospacial framework for safe navigation and oil spill response through increased hydrographic and bathymetic surveying, mapping, and navigational charting, geodetic positioning, and monitoring of tides, sea levels, and currents in the Arctic. (Sec. 107) Requires the Under Secretary to: (1) review the current state of NOAA and NOAA's capacity to monitor, map, and track subsea hydrocarbons; and (2) establish a hydrocarbon monitoring and assessment program that is based on such review. Sets forth provisions concerning transferring funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to the Secretary of Commerce to carry out such review and program. Title II: Improving Coast Guard Response and Inspection Capacity - (Sec. 202) Requires the Commandant of the Coast Guard to assess and take action to reduce the risk of, and improve the capability of the United States to respond to, a maritime disaster in the U.S. Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Requires such assessment and actions to include the prioritization of resources to address: (1) oil spill prevention and response capabilities and infrastructure; (2) the coordination of contingency plans and agreements with other U.S. agencies, industry, and foreign governments to respond to an Arctic oil spill; (3) the expansion of search and rescue capabilities, infrastructure, and logistics; (4) the provisional designation of places of refuge; (5) the evaluation and enhancement of navigational infrastructure, vessel monitoring, tracking, and automated identification systems, and navigational aids and communications infrastructure for safe navigation and marine accident prevention in the Arctic; (6) shipping traffic risk assessments for the Bering Strait and the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas; and (7) the integration of local and traditional knowledge and concerns into prevention and response strategies. (Sec. 203) Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to require response plans approved by the Coast Guard under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to be updated at least once every five years and to utilize the best commercially available technology and methods to contain and remove a worst case discharge and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such discharge. Authorizes the Coast Guard to establish requirements and guidance for utilizing such technology and methods. Considers each update to be a significant change that must be resubmitted for approval by the Coast Guard. Directs the Secretary to require that all vessel response plans prepared pursuant to National Response System for vessels and other structures which are capable of exploring for, drilling for, developing, or producing oil or gas include plans for responding to a worst case discharge and to a threat of such discharge. (Sec. 204) Amends the Clean Water Act to require: (1) each Area Committee to assure advance planning with respect to the closing and reopening of fishing grounds following an oil spill; (2) each Area Contingency Plan to develop a framework for such planning; and (3) the President, acting through the Commandant of the Coast Guard, to issue guidance for Area Committees to use in developing such framework. (Sec. 205) Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a program for the formal evaluation and validation of oil pollution containment and removal methods and technologies; and (2) consider whether a validated method or technology meets a performance capability warranting designation of a new standard for best available technology or methods.
