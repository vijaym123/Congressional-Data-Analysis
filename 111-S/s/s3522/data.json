Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) require DHS detention facilities to implement procedures to ensure that child custody and family interests can be considered in any immigration detention action; (2) develop memoranda of understanding with child welfare agencies and community organizations that protect the best interests of children of detained individuals; and (3) provide DHS personnel with appropriate training."
