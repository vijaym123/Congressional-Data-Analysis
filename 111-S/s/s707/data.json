    "text": "Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 - (Sec. 3) Requires each executive agency to establish a telework policy, determine and notify eligible employees, provide an interactive telework training program for eligible employees and their managers, and ensure that teleworkers and nonteleworkers are treated the same for purposes of performance appraisals, training, retention, work requirements, or other acts involving managerial discretion. Requires such policy to: (1) ensure that telework does not diminish employee performance or agency operations; (2) require a written agreement between the agency manager and the employee; (3) exclude employees whose performance does not comply with the terms of such agreement or whose official duties require daily direct handling of secure materials or on-site activity that cannot be handled remotely or at an alternate worksite, except in emergency situations; and (4) be incorporated as part of the agency's continuity of operations plans. (Sec. 5) Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to: (1) provide policy and policy guidance for telework; (2) assist each agency in establishing qualitative and quantitative measures and teleworking goals; (3) maintain a central telework website; and (4) report to specified congressional committees annually on each agency's telework programs. (Sec. 6) Directs each agency to: (1) designate a Telework Managing Officer; and (2) report to the Chief Human Capital Officers Council on agency management efforts to promote telework. (Sec. 7) Requires the Comptroller General to: (1) report on the telework program of the Government Accountability Office (GAO); and (2) review OPM's first report on each agency's telework programs and report on the agency's progress in meeting its teleworking goals. (Sec. 8) Sets forth provisions regarding authority for agency test programs for paying travel expenses for teleworking employees. (Sec. 9) Reauthorizes and modifies the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) travel expenses test program. Authorizes USPTO to pay any travel expenses of an employee for travel to and from a USPTO worksite if: (1) the employee is employed at a USPTO worksite and enters into an approved telework arrangement; (2) the employee requests to telework from a location beyond the local commuting area of that worksite; and (3) USPTO approves the requested arrangement for reasons of employee convenience instead of an agency need for the employee to relocate in order to perform duties specific to the new location. Requires USPTO to establish an oversight committee to develop operating procedures to provide for the effective and appropriate functioning of the program and to ensure that: (1) reasonable technological or other alternatives to employee travel are used before requiring employee travel, including teleconferencing, videoconferencing, or Internet-based technologies; (2) the program is applied consistently and equitably throughout USPTO; and (3) an optimal operating standard is developed and implemented for maximizing the use of the telework arrangement while minimizing agency travel expenses and employee travel requirements. Requires the USPTO Director to: (1) prepare an analysis of the expected costs and benefits and a set of criteria for evaluating program effectiveness; and (2) report on program results at specified intervals to the Administrator of General Services (GSA) and to specified congressional committees."
