    "text": "Safe Drug Disposal Act of 2009 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to direct the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to: (1) authorize an ultimate user or care taker (a person responsible for taking care of one or more individuals or animals) to dispose of a controlled substance in accordance with a prescribed state program; (2) include five model state programs providing for such disposal through delivery to a designated facility; and (3) allow a state to work with the Attorney General to devise an alternative disposal program that is consistent with this Act. Requires each such program to: (1) require a state to enact legislation as a prerequisite to its adoption and implementation; (2) protect the public safety; (3) allow disposal of controlled substances through persons other than law enforcement personnel; (4) incorporate environmentally sound practices for disposal; (5) be cost-effective; (6) include convenient take-back options for urban and rural locations; and (6) not restrict the funding a state may use to implement it. Allows such a program to apply similarly to a drug or biological product other than a controlled substance. Directs the Comptroller General to collect data on state take-back disposal programs and periodically report to Congress. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services: (1) in approving drug applications and in licensing biological products, to ensure that the drug or product labeling does not include any recommendation or direction to dispose of the drug by means of a wastewater treatment system, such as by flushing it down the toilet; and (2) to review the labeling of existing drugs and products and order revision of any labeling that includes such a recommendation or direction. Deems any drug or product whose labeling is in violation of such an order to be misbranded."
