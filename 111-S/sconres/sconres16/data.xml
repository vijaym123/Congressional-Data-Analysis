  <summary>4/1/2009--Introduced.
Calls for the President to grant a pardon, posthumously, to Jack Johnson (the first African-American professional boxer to hold the title of Heavyweight Champion of the World) to expunge from the annals of American criminal justice a racially motivated abuse of the federal government's prosecutorial authority and to recognize his athletic and cultural contributions to society.</summary>
