  <summary>6/9/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Sentate that: (1) all individuals should have the choice of a community health center as their health care home; (2) every health center should be appropriately reimbursed for the high-value preventive and primary care they provide; (3) health care reform should include measures to expand community health centers; (4) the current payment mechanisms for federally qualified health centers through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP, formerly known as SCHIP) are essential to ensuring access to affordable and high-quality preventive and primary care services for program beneficiaries; (5) any expansion of private insurance must include mechanisms to ensure the full participation of, and appropriate reimbursement to, federally qualified health centers and other safety net providers; and (6) ensuring access to all safety net providers is vital to ensuring that health care reform is successful in expanding access, improving quality, and reducing cost.</summary>
