(Sec. 315) Makes it out of order to consider a budget resolution in the Senate unless it: (1) contains a specified \"Truth in Debt Disclosure\" section; and (2) includes a table that contains, for each of the previous 12 fiscal years, specified information based on the budget resolution for each such fiscal year. Declares that, if any portion of the Social Security surplus is projected to be spent and/or the gross federal debt in the 5th year of the budget window is greater than the debt projected in the current year, then the report, print, or statement of managers accompanying the budget resolution shall contain a section that: (1) details the circumstances making it in the national interest to allow federal debt to increase rather than taking steps to reduce it; and (2) provides a justification for allowing the surpluses in the Social Security Trust Fund to be spent on other federal functions even as the baby boom generation retires, program costs are projected to rise dramatically, the debt owed to Social Security is about to come due, and the Trust Fund is projected to go insolvent.
