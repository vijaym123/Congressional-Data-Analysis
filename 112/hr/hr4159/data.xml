  <summary>3/7/2012--Introduced.
American Jobs in American Forests Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of Labor, as a component of the H-2B (temporary nonagricultural workers) labor certification process, to take specified actions to recruit U.S. workers before petitioning to hire H-2B workers. Requires a prospective H-2B employer to submit a separate petition for each state in which the employer plans to employ H-2B non-immigrants for a period of at least seven days. Prohibits the Secretary from granting a temporary labor certification to a prospective H-2B employer until the Director of the state workforce agency has determined that: (1) employer recruitment requirements have been met, and (2) U.S. nationals are not qualified or available to fill such employment opportunities.</summary>
