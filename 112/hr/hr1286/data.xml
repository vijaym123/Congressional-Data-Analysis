  <summary>3/31/2011--Introduced.
Healthcare Fiscal Accountability Act of 2011 - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to convert specified funding under such Act from a direct appropriation to an authorization of appropriations or from a transfer to an authorization of such transfer, including funding for: (1) the establishment of a temporary high-risk pool for uninsured individuals with preexisting conditions, (2) the establishment of a temporary reinsurance program for early retirees, (3) health insurance exchanges, and (4) the Prevention and Public Health Fund. Rescinds or restores the unobligated balances of funds available pursuant to such direct appropriations or transfers, respectively. Repeals provisions of PPACA, as if such provisions had not been enacted, that appropriate funds to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP, formerly known as SCHIP) for allotments to states, the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund, and outreach and enrollment grants. Repeals provisions of PPACA appropriating funds, except with respect to FY2010 or FY2011, for: (1) allotments to states for abstinence education, (2) special projects of regional and national significance for the development and support of family-to-family health information centers for families of children with disabilities or special health care needs, and (3) the National Clearinghouse for Long-Term Care Information. Rescinds the unobligated portion of funds available pursuant to such provisions for FY2010-FY2011.</summary>
