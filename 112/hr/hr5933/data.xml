  <summary>6/8/2012--Introduced.
Amends the school improvement program under part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to modify the requirement that state and local funds be used to provide services to schools receiving school improvement funds that are comparable to services received by schools not receiving such funds. Conditions a local educational agency's (LEA's) receipt of school improvement funds, beginning with the 2015-2016 school year, on the LEA showing its state that combined state and local per-pupil expenditures in each of its schools served under the school improvement program are not less than the average combined state and local per-pupil expenditures for each of its schools not served under that program. Requires an LEA that serves all of its schools under the school improvement program to show its state that the average combined state and local per-pupil expenditures for its high-poverty schools were not less than those expenditures for its low-poverty schools. Allows LEAs to meet these requirements on a grade-span by grade-span or school-by-school basis. Requires LEAs to exclude from these calculations state and local funds expended in any school for capital expenditures or the excess costs of providing services to English learners or disabled children.</summary>
