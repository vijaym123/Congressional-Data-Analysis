Prohibits certain unobligated funds from being made available under HAMP. Restricts the use of such funds solely to federal budget deficit reduction.

(Sec. 343) Amends the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (FDPA) to authorize the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to suspend temporarily the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement for areas designated as having special flood hazards, if they meet certain eligibility requirements. Requires a lender or servicer who receives confirmation of a borrower's existing flood insurance coverage to terminate force-placed insurance and to refund all force-placed insurance premiums and related fees. Requires each federal entity for lending regulation to direct regulated lending institutions to accept private flood insurance if it meets federal flood insurance requirements. (Sec. 344) Amends NFIA to prescribe minimum annual flood insurance deductibles for subsidized and actuarial rate properties. Sets forth a formula for indexing maximum coverage limits. Authorizes optional coverage of loss of use of personal residence and business interruption. Requires flood insurance regulations to allow payment of flood insurance premiums in installments. Requires a new flood insurance policy on a property affected by a flood in progress during the 30-day waiting period before the policy's effective date to cover damage caused by the flood, but only if: (1) the damage occurs after expiration of the waiting period, and (2) the property has not suffered damage or loss from the flood before expiration of the period. (Sec. 345) Raises the annual limitation on premium increases from 10% to 20% of the average of the risk premium rates for any properties within any single risk classification. Schedules a 5-year phase-in of chargeable risk premium rates for: (1) an area that has been upgraded to a special flood hazard area, and (2) preferred risk rate areas.

Prohibits extension of subsidized rates for policies lapsed as a result of the policy holder's deliberate choice. Makes communities making adequate progress at reconstruction or improvement to 100-year frequency flood protection systems eligible for premium flood insurance rates that would apply if the reconstruction or improvement were completed. Revises requirements for special flood hazard rates for a community in the process of restoring flood protection afforded by a system previously accredited as providing 100-year frequency flood protection but no longer does so. (Sec. 346) Establishes the Technical Mapping Advisory Council to develop proposed new mapping standards for 100-year flood insurance rate maps used under the Program.

Exempts temporarily from mandatory flood insurance purchase and compliance requirements certain property located in a special flood hazard area. (Sec. 349) Requires the FEMA Administrator and the Comptroller General each to study options for privatizing the Program. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) carry out private risk-management initiatives to determine the capacity of private insurers, reinsurers, and financial markets to assist communities, on a voluntary basis only, in managing the full range of financial risks associated with flooding; and (2) secure flood reinsurance coverage from private market insurance, reinsurance, and capital market sources. Requires the Administrator to: (1) assess annually the Program's claims-paying ability, including its utilization of private sector reinsurance; and (2) report annually to Congress on the financial status of the Program and the National Flood Insurance Fund. (Sec. 351) Revises requirements for the mitigation assistance grant program. Repeals authority for planning assistance grants. Changes from flood risk mitigation to multi-hazard risk mitigation the plan a state or community is required to develop to be eligible for mitigation assistance.
