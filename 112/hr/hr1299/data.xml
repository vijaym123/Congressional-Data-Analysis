  <summary>5/30/2012--Passed House amended.
Secure Border Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a comprehensive strategy for gaining, within five years, operational control of the international borders between U.S. ports of entry. Requires such strategy to include an analysis of: (1) staffing requirements; (2) infrastructure needs; (3) the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, camera technology, sensors, and other innovative technology; (4) cooperative agreements with international, state, local, tribal, and other federal law enforcement agencies; (5) other means designed to respond to unlawful cross-border activity and to reduce the level of violence; (6) a schedule for implementing security measures; (7) a plan for major surveillance and detection technology programs; and (8) the recommendations made in the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report "Enhanced DHS Oversight and Assessment of Interagency Coordination is Needed for the Northern Border." Directs the Secretary to develop metrics to measure security effectiveness at ports of entry which shall consider: (1) the number of infractions related to personnel and cargo committed by major violators; (2) the required number of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers, Agricultural Specialists, and Canine Enforcement Officers necessary to achieve operational control; (3) infrastructure improvements; (4) resource deployment; and (5) the recommendations made in such GAO report. Sets forth reporting requirements.</summary>
