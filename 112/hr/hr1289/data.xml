  <summary>3/31/2011--Introduced.
Share America's Diverse History in the Capitol Act - Increases from two to three the number of statues a state may provide for placement in Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol honoring deceased citizens of the state. Expresses the sense of Congress that, in light of the fact that statues of women and members of racial and ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in the U.S. Capitol, each state should use the opportunity provided by this Act to furnish a statue depicting such an individual who is a notable figure in the state's history.</summary>
