Amends the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 to repeal provisions prohibiting the use of appropriated funds: (1) to implement a national instant criminal background check system that does not require the destruction of identifying information within 24 hours after the system determines and advises a federal firearms licensee that a person's possession or receipt of a firearm would not violate federal or state law, or (2) to promulgate or implement any rule requiring a physical inventory of a licensed firearms dealer."
