  <summary>5/18/2012--Introduced.
Veterans and Service Members Educational Benefits Safety Act - Makes institutions of higher education that have a cohort default rate equal to or greater than 30% for each of the three most recent fiscal years ineligible to participate in military and veterans' educational assistance programs. (The cohort default rate represents the percentage of a school's current and former students who begin to repay Federal Family Education Loans [FFELs] in a fiscal year, but default on those loans before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year they began repaying them.) Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require proprietary institutions of higher education to derive not less than 10% of their revenue from sources other than veterans' education benefits or, as under current law, title IV, or become ineligible for title IV funding (90/10 rule).</summary>
