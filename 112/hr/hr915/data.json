Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish BEST units in jurisdictions in which such units can contribute to BEST missions, after considering: (1) whether the area in which the unit would be established is significantly impacted by cross-border threats; (2) the availability of federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law enforcement resources to participate in the unit; (3) the extent to which border security threats are having a significant harmful impact in the area and in other U.S. jurisdictions; and (4) whether an Integrated Border Enforcement Team already exists in the area. Directs the Secretary, in determining whether to establish or expand a BEST unit in a given jurisdiction, to ensure that the unit under consideration does not duplicate the efforts of other existing interagency task forces or centers within that jurisdiction. Authorizes the Secretary, after determining the jurisdictions in which to establish BEST units and in order to provide federal assistance to such jurisdictions, to: (1) direct the assignment of federal personnel to BEST; and (2) take other actions to assist federal, state, local, and tribal entities to participate in BEST, including providing financial assistance for operational, administrative, and technological costs associated with such participation. Directs the Secretary to report annually on the effectiveness of the program in enhancing border security and reducing the drug trafficking, arms smuggling, illegal alien trafficking and smuggling, violence, and kidnapping along and across U.S. borders."
