  <summary>9/21/2012--Introduced.
Care Coordination for Older Americans Act of 2012 - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to make it a duty and function of the Administration on Aging (AOA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide technical assistance to, and share best practices with, states, area agencies on aging, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and service providers to carry out outreach and coordinate activities with health care entities in order to assure better care coordination for individuals with multiple chronic illnesses. Requires AOA also to coordinate activities with other federal agencies working to improve care coordination and developing new models and best practices. Requires the designated state agency to promote the development and implementation of a state system to: (1) address the care coordination needs of older individuals with multiple chronic illnesses; and (2) work with acute care providers, area agencies on aging, service providers, and federal agencies to ensure that the system uses best practices. Requires area and state plans to provide assurances that the area agencies on aging will facilitate the area-wide development and implementation of an area-wide system to address the care coordination needs of older individuals with multiple chronic illnesses.</summary>
