Directs the Secretary to allocate grant funds based on each state's: (1) population of individuals aged 5 through 17 relative to all other states, and (2) total population relative to all other states. Sets forth application requirements, including assurances with respect to maintenance of state support for early childhood, elementary, and secondary education at no less than FY2011 levels. Requires a state to: (1) reserve 10% of grant funds for awards to state-funded early learning programs; and (2) allocate remaining funds to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on each LEA's enrollment, and the amount of funds received by the LEA for basic programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, relative to the enrollment of and amounts received by all other LEAs in the state. Requires early learning programs and LEAs to use such funds only to pay compensation, benefits, and other expenses necessary to retain existing employees, recall or rehire former employees, or hire new employees to provide early childhood, elementary, or secondary educational and related services. Directs: (1) the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to make competitive grants to hire, rehire, and retain firefighters pursuant to the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 and to maintain resources for fire departments; and (2) the Attorney General to make competitive grants to hire, rehire, and retain career law enforcement officers pursuant to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Authorizes additional appropriations for FY2012-FY2013 for such grants."
