Lowell National Historical Park Land Exchange Act of 2012 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to exchange any land or interest within the boundaries of Lowell National Historical Park in Massachusetts for any land or interest owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the city of Lowell, or the University of Massachusetts Building Authority. Subjects, except as provided below, an exchange under this Act to the laws, regulations, and policies applicable to land exchanges administered by the National Park Service (NPS) and any other terms and conditions that are determined to be necessary to protect U.S. interests. Requires, where facilities or infrastructure required for the management and operation of the Park exists on the federal land to be exchanged and the non-federal land or interest to be exchanged is not of equal value, the values to be equalized by a cash payment to the Secretary. Bars the Secretary from being required to equalize the values of any exchange conducted under this Act if the land or interest received by the federal government exceeds the value of the federal land or interest exchanged.</summary>
