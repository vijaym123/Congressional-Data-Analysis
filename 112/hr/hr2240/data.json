Subjects, except as provided below, an exchange under this Act to the laws, regulations, and policies applicable to land exchanges administered by the National Park Service (NPS) and any other terms and conditions that are determined to be necessary to protect U.S. interests. Requires, where facilities or infrastructure required for the management and operation of the Park exists on the federal land to be exchanged and the non-federal land or interest to be exchanged is not of equal value, the values to be equalized by a cash payment to the Secretary. Bars the Secretary from being required to equalize the values of any exchange conducted under this Act if the land or interest received by the federal government exceeds the value of the federal land or interest exchanged."
