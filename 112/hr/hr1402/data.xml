  <summary>8/16/2012--Public Law.
Makes funds appropriated to the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) for the Capitol power plant in any fiscal year available to construct, operate, and maintain on a reimbursable basis battery recharging stations in parking areas under the jurisdiction of the House of Representatives on Capitol grounds for use by privately owned vehicles used by: (1) Members of the House, or (2) employees whose pay is disbursed by the Chief Administrative Officer of the House or any other individuals authorized to park in any parking area under House jurisdiction on Capitol grounds (covered employees). Requires the Architect to charge Members and covered employees fees for the electricity sufficient to cover costs, including those to any vendors or other costs associated with maintaining the battery recharging stations. Requires the AOC to report triennially to the Committee on House Administration on whether or not individuals using the battery charging stations receive a subsidy from the taxpayers, and, if so, to submit a plan to the Committee to update the program to ensure that no subsidy is being received. Requires the AOC, if the Committee fails to act on the plan within 60 days, to take appropriate steps to increase rates or fees to ensure reimbursement for the cost of the program.</summary>
