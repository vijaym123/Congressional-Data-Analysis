  <summary>9/19/2012--Passed House amended.
Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2012 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) U.S. ability to attract inbound investment (particularly net new investment) is directly linked to U.S. long-term economic prosperity, competitiveness, and security; (2) Congress and federal departments and agencies should be mindful of the potential impact upon U.S. ability to attract foreign direct investment when evaluating proposed legislation or regulatory policy; (3) it is a top national priority to enhance U.S. competitiveness, prosperity, and security by removing unnecessary barriers to inward global investment and the U.S. jobs it creates and promoting policies to ensure the United States remains the premier destination for global companies to invest, hire, innovate, and manufacture their products; and (4) U.S. policies regarding foreign direct investment should reflect national security interests. Amends the Foreign Direct Investment and International Financial Data Improvements Act of 1990 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to conduct an interagency review of U.S. laws and policies on foreign direct investment in the United States and develop recommendations to make the United States more competitive in attracting and retaining strong investment flows from abroad.</summary>
