  <summary>9/20/2012--Introduced.
Military CDL Act of 2012 - Revises certain commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements with which a state must comply in order to avoid the administrative penalty of a withholding by the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) of a percentage of the state's apportionment of certain federal-aid highway program funds. Permits a state to issue a CDL to an individual who operates or will operate a commercial motor vehicle and who: (1) is an active duty member of the Armed Forces, including the military reserves, National Guard, U.S. Coast Guard, or Coast Guard Auxiliary; and (2) is not domiciled in the state, but whose temporary or permanent duty station is located there.</summary>
