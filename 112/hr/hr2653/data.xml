  <summary>7/26/2011--Introduced.
Stop Pay for Members Act - Prohibits the liquidation of the obligation to pay basic pay of Members of Congress, if the U.S. public debt reaches the public debt limit, until: (1) all other obligations of the U.S. government then due have been liquidated; or (2) if earlier, the ability of the U.S. Treasury to liquidate the such obligations in timely manner is restored, whether by an increase in the public debt limit or otherwise. Declares that each Member of Congress consents and agrees that payment of basic pay in accordance with this Act shall constitute a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands for service as such a Member during the period covered by the payment.</summary>
