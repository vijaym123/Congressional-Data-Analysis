(Current law terminates such authority one year after enactment of such Act.) Requires the Secretary to: (1) supply an institution whose application to receive a capital investment from the Fund is rejected with the reason for such rejection, (2) establish an appeal process, and (3) issue regulations allowing a rejected institution to reapply for such an investment."
