  <summary>10/11/2011--Introduced.
Small Business Lending Extension Act - Amends the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 to extend, for an additional year, the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury under the Small Business Lending Fund Program to make capital investments in eligible institutions (eligible insured depository institutions, bank holding companies, and savings and loan companies) in order to increase the availability of credit for small businesses. (Current law terminates such authority one year after enactment of such Act.) Requires the Secretary to: (1) supply an institution whose application to receive a capital investment from the Fund is rejected with the reason for such rejection, (2) establish an appeal process, and (3) issue regulations allowing a rejected institution to reapply for such an investment.</summary>
