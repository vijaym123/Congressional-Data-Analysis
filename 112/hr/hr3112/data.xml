Trade Law Enforcement Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in cases where a complaint is received from an interested person that a foreign country is engaging in an act, policy, or practice that acts as a nontariff barrier to U.S. commerce, and the Secretary is unable to resolve the complaint within 180 days, to issue an opinion as to whether: (1) the rights of the United States under any trade agreement are being denied because of such act, policy, or practice; or (2) the act, policy, or practice violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce. Requires the Secretary, in cases of an affirmative determination, to refer such matter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) for investigation.</summary>
