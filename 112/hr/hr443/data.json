Shields the Maniilaq Association from liability for soil, surface water, groundwater, or other contamination resulting from the disposal, release, or presence of environmental contamination, including oil or petroleum products, or hazardous substances on any of the property on or before the date on which all of the properties were conveyed by quitclaim deed. Accords to the Secretary any easement or access to the conveyed property as may be necessary to satisfy any retained obligations and liability. Requires the Secretary to be in compliance with requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) respecting certain deeds for the transfer of U.S. owned real property on which any hazardous substance was stored for one year or more, disposed of, or known to have been released."
