Servicemembers' Telemedicine and E-Health Portability Act of 2011 or STEP Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to allow certain licensed health-care professionals to provide care to members of the Armed Forces at any location and regardless of where the professional or patient are located, so long as the practice is within the scope of authorized federal duties. Includes among authorized health-care professionals civilian DOD employees, DOD personal service contractors, or other health-care professionals credentialed and privileged at a federal health care institution or location specially designated by the Secretary for such purpose. Requires a report from the Secretary to Congress on plans to develop and expand programs to use new Internet and communication technologies, including telemedicine, telehealth care services, and telebehavioral health programs, to improve patient access to care and resources.</summary>
