Authorizes the Secretary to collect and set fee amounts. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to admit into the United States a qualifying Canadian citizen over 50 years old and spouse for a period not to exceed 240 days if the person maintains a Canadian residence and owns a U.S. residence or has rented a U.S. accommodation for the duration of such stay. Directs the Secretary to make publicly available each month data for the previous two years regarding visa appointment availability for each visa processing post to allow applicants to identify periods of low demand. Revises the visa waiver program to: (1) authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate any country as a program country, (2) adjust visa refusal rate criteria, including addition of a 3% maximum overstay rate, and (3) revise probationary and termination provisions. Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to include in the Global Entry Trusted Traveler Network individuals who meet security requirements and are employed and sponsored by an international organization which maintains a strong working relationship with the United States. Prohibits enrollment in the Network of a person who is a citizen of a state sponsor of terror as defined in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010. Directs the Secretary to require U.S. diplomatic and consular missions to: (1) conduct nonimmigrant visa application interviews expeditiously, consistent with national security requirements and in recognition of resource allocation considerations; (2) set a goal of interviewing 80% of all nonimmigrant visa applicants, worldwide, within three weeks of application receipt; and (3) explore expanding visa processing capacity in China and Brazil with the goal of maintaining interview wait times under 15 work days, recognizing that the first priority of U.S. missions abroad is U.S. citizen protection."
