Considers only a degree from a degree-granting institution that is accredited by such an accreditor to be acceptable in situations when a degree from an institution of higher education (IHE) is required or taken into consideration for the purpose of appointing, promoting, or improving the pay of a federal employee. Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to define as an unfair and deceptive act or practice: (1) certain offerings of academic, professional, or occupational degrees by entities that are not IHEs or are not accredited by an accreditor recognized by the Secretary of Education, any other appropriate federal agency, or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation; or (2) the issuing of any accreditation to a degree-granting institution by an accreditor that lacks such recognition."
