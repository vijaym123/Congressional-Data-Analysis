  <summary>5/31/2011--Introduced.
Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act of 2011 - Prohibits a state or local government from receiving federal financial assistance for a minimum of one year if such jurisdiction restricts or prohibits a government entity or official from: (1) sending to or receiving from the responsible federal immigration agency information regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status, or (2) maintaining or exchanging information about an individual's status. Restores assistance eligibility upon a determination by the Attorney General (DOJ) that the jurisdiction no longer restricts or prohibits such actions. Directs the Attorney General to report each year to Congress regarding state or local jurisdictions that restrict or prohibit such actions.</summary>
