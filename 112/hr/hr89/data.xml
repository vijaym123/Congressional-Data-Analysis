American Child Support Enforcement Immigration Act of 2011 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) from approving a family-based immigration petition or fiance/fiancee nonimmigrant petition by a petitioner certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) as owing child support arrearages. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Services to revoke a previously-approved petition (if a visa has not been issued or a status adjustment has not been effected) if such petition would not have been approved had the provisions of this Act been in effect.</summary>
