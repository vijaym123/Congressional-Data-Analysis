  <summary>7/7/2011--Introduced.
American Traveller Dignity Act of 2011 - Prohibits any law of the United States from being construed to confer immunity for a federal employee or agency, or any individual or entity that receives federal funds, who subjects an individual to any physical contact, x-rays, or millimeter waves, or aids in the creation of or views a representation of any part of an individual's body covered by clothing, as a condition for such individual to be in an airport or to fly in an aircraft. Makes this provision applicable even if the individual or the individual's parent, guardian, or any other individual gives consent.</summary>
