  <summary>9/21/2012--Introduced.
Amends the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), from any appropriations for a fiscal year containing a qualifying winter season, to allot to each qualifying state, at least 25% of whose households use heating oil as the primary heating fuel, an amount that is at least the same as that allotted to the state for FY2010. Requires that allotments to states that do not qualify under this Act be ratably reduced if necessary to ensure the allotments to qualifying states. Defines a "qualifying winter season" as one occurring after enactment of this Act for which the projected average price of heating oil is greater than the average price for the winter of 2011-2012.</summary>
