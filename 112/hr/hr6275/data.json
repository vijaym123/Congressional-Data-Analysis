Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to extend through 2014 the grant program for investment in alternative and renewable energy property in lieu of tax credits for such property. Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) establish a voluntary voucher program, through 2015, for the purchase of plug-in electric vehicles; and (2) provide grants to state, local, and tribal governments for the installation and operation of public charging stations for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to extend through FY2022 loan guarantees for renewable energy systems, electronic power transmission systems, and certain biofuel projects. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue Clean Energy Victory Bonds to pay for the extension of the energy-related tax expenditures in this Act."
