Prohibits the furnishing of such casket or urn in the case of a veteran convicted of a federal or state capital crime. Requires the Secretary, in the case of a deceased veteran with no next of kin and without sufficient resources to cover funeral and burial expenses, to ensure that the entity responsible for transporting the body to a national cemetery for burial notifies the VA as to whether such veteran was cremated and steps taken to ensure that such veteran has no next of kin. Directs the Secretary to report to the congressional veterans committees on VA compliance with industry standards for caskets and urns."
