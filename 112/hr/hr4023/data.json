Requires the Secretary to modify the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation system to: (1) provide incentives for the use of teleconsultation, teleretinal imaging, telemedicine, and telehealth coordination services; and (2) require the inclusion of all telemedicine visits in the calculation of facility workload.
