  <summary>5/18/2012--Introduced.
Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2012 - Prohibits the McCarran-Ferguson Act from being construed to permit issuers of health or medical malpractice insurance to engage in any form of price fixing, bid rigging, or market allocations in connection with the conduct of the business of providing health insurance coverage or coverage of medical malpractice claims or actions. Amends such Act to provide that nothing in it shall modify, impair, or supersede the operation of any of the antitrust laws with respect to the business of health insurance. Applies prohibitions against using unfair methods of competition to the business of health insurance without regard to whether such business is carried on for profit.</summary>
