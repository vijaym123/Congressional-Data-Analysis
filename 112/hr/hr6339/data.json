    "text": "Electronic Communications Privacy Act Modernization Act of 2012 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise rules for requiring disclosure by a governmental entity of wire or electronic communications and for delaying notification of the issuance of a warrant requiring such disclosure. Extends such disclosure requirements to providers of a remote computing service. Permits disclosure by a service provider only pursuant to: (1) a warrant complying with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and issued by a court with jurisdiction over the offense under investigation or equivalent state warrant, or (2) a court under title I or title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to make rules regarding the content and form of reports required under this Act. Requires the Attorney General to study trends relating to the frequency and effectiveness of the use of mobile tracking devices. Revises reporting requirements for orders for pen registers and trap and trace devices to require issuing or denying judges to report specified information about such orders to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and to require the Director of such Office to report to Congress on such orders. Amends the federal criminal code to allow individuals aggrieved by the interception of an electronic communication to move in court to suppress the content of any such communication (currently, allowed for wire or oral communications only)."
