Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2011- Prohibits any person who has a seriously delinquent tax debt from obtaining a federal government contract or grant. Requires federal agency heads to require prospective recipients of a contract or grant in excess of an amount equal to the simplified acquisition threshold to: (1) certify that they do not have such a debt; and (2) authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose information describing whether they have such a debt. Defines "seriously delinquent tax debt" as an outstanding tax debt for which a notice of lien has been filed in public records.</summary>
