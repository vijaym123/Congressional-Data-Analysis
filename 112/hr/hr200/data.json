Requires the survey to include an analysis of: (1) the delineation of the aquifers in the Basin; (2) the availability of groundwater resources for human use; (3) the salinity of groundwater resources; (4) the identification of a recent surge in perchlorate concentrations in groundwater, whether significant sources are being flushed through the vadose zone, or if perchlorate is being remobilized; (5) the identification of impacts and extents of all source areas that contribute to the regional plume to be fully characterized; (6) the potential of the groundwater resources to recharge; (7) the interaction between groundwater and surface water; and (8) the susceptibility of the aquifers to contamination."
