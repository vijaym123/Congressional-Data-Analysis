Juvenile Justice Accountability and Improvement Act of 2011- Requires states to: (1) enact laws and adopt policies to grant child offenders who are serving a life sentence a meaningful opportunity for parole or supervised release at least once during their first 15 years of incarceration and at least once every 3 years thereafter, and (2) provide notice of such laws and policies to the public and to victims of child offenders. Defines "child offender who is serving a life sentence" as an individual who is convicted of one or more offenses where any act or acts in furtherance of the offense or offenses was committed before the individual attained the age of 18 and who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life or a term exceeding 15 years. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish and implement a system of early release for each child offender who is under a life sentence in a federal prison, and (2) award grants to states to improve legal representation and other services for child defendants charged with or convicted of an offense carrying a possible sentence of life in prison.</summary>
