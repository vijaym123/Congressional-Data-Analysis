  <summary>5/16/2012--Introduced.
Amends provisions of federal law relating to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and its employees to: (1) require the transfer of any surplus government contributions to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) in FY2012-FY2014 for postal employees to USPS for repayment of debt obligations and to make required payments to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund and to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, and (2) authorize USPS to provide nonpostal services. Expresses the sense of Congress that if USPS is permitted to offer its employees health benefits under a program separate from the Federal Employees Health Benefits&#160; Program, the Postmaster General shall work with employee representatives in exclusive bargaining units to establish such a program.</summary>
