Requires that such background check include: (1) a search of the national Sex Offender Registry, the National Crime Information Center, state criminal registries, and state-based abuse and neglect registries and databases; and (2) a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check. Makes a child care provider ineligible for Program funds if the criminal background check reveals an adult felony conviction of any such individual for: (1) child abuse or neglect; (2) spousal abuse; (3) a crime against children (including child pornography); (4) a violent crime; or (5) distribution, possession with intent to distribute, or importation of a controlled substance committed within the previous five years. Allows: (1) a child care provider or an individual subject to a background check to appeal the results to the appropriate designated state agency, and (2) a state to collect a fee from providers for such background checks to defray costs."
