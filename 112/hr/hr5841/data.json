Sets forth permitted uses of grant funds, including to: (1) adapt and implement evidence-based parenting skills training programs for caregivers from all backgrounds who use the health center for health care and child well-visits; (2) adapt instruments and screen caregivers for child maltreatment risk factors such as depression, substance abuse, and intimate partner violence; and (3) provide access to mental health services to caregivers screened positive for child maltreatment risk factors. Requires the Secretary to award a contract for the provision of technical assistance, project coordination, and training for health care professionals for grantees under this Act."
