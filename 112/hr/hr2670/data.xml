Jobs for Americans Act of 2011 - Authorizes states and their political subdivisions to enact and enforce laws that help identify illegal aliens, deter illegal aliens from entering the United States, apprehend illegal aliens, or encourage or cause illegal aliens to leave the United States. Prohibits states and their political subdivisions from enacting or enforcing laws that are inconsistent with federal statutes that define the lawful status of persons who are in the United States. Prohibits any law from preempting any state or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions upon persons who knowingly aid or abet, in any way, the presence of an illegal alien within the borders of the United States. Exempts from civil and criminal liability any person or entity for taking an action or failing to take an action that was undertaken in good faith to comply with the law. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding the unlawful employment of aliens to prohibit any law from preempting any state or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions upon persons who knowingly employ, recruit, or refer for a fee an unauthorized alien.</summary>
