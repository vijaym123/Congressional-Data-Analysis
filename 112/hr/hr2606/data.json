Requires such permit to be: (1) consistent with the laws and regulations generally applicable to utility rights-of-way within units of the National Park System (NPS), and (2) subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate. Requires the Secretary to: (1) charge a fee for any such permit based upon fair market value; (2) provide for recovery of costs incurred by the NPS for permit processing, issuance, and monitoring; and (3) retain any fees associated with the recovery of costs. Limits such permit to a term of 10 years, subject to renewal at the Secretary's discretion. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a noncompetitive lease with Transco to allow the occupancy and use of buildings and associated property at Floyd Bennett Field within the GNRA to house meter and regulating equipment and other equipment necessary to the operation of the natural gas pipeline facilities. Requires such lease to: (1) comply with NPS leasing regulations, but permits the proceeds from rental payments to be used for infrastructure needs, resource protection and restoration, and visitor services at GNRA; and (2) provide for building and property restoration and maintenance, including regulations and programmatic agreements, in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary to impose citations or fines, or to suspend or revoke any authority under a permit or lease, for either noncompliance or for a violation of any term or condition."
