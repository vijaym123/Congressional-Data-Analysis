Defines \"qualified small business\" under the Act as any business concern having 50 or fewer employees, whether or not: (1) the credit card account is in the name of an individual or a business entity, and (2) any credit transaction involving such account is for business or personal purposes. Permits a qualified small business to elect to opt out of coverage by the Act. Exempts from coverage by the Act any credit transaction in which the total amount financed exceeds $50,000 (currently $25,000). Requires certain creditor disclosures before opening any account under an open end consumer credit plan for a qualified small business. Prohibits a creditor from: (1) discriminating against any business concern having 50 or fewer employees in connection with any credit card account under an open end credit plan; or (2) requiring any qualified small business to make an opt-out election as a condition for opening a credit card account, or for providing more advantageous terms for such an account."
