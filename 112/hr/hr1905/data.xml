  <summary>8/10/2012--Public Law.
Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 - Title I: Expansion of Multilateral Sanctions Regime with Respect to Iran - (Sec. 101) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the goal of compelling Iran to abandon efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons capability and other threatening activities can be achieved through a policy that includes economic sanctions, diplomacy, and military planning; and (2) this objective is consistent with the one stated by President Obama in the 2012 State of the Union Address. (Sec. 102) Urges the President to initiate diplomatic efforts to expand the multilateral sanctions regime regarding Iran. Title II: Expansion of Sanctions Relating to the Energy Sector of Iran and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction by Iran - Subtitle A: Expansion of Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 - (Sec. 201) Amends the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Act) to increase from three to five the minimum number of sanctions that the President is required to impose for violations relating to: (1) development of Iran's petroleum resources, (2) production of refined petroleum products, (3) exportation of refined petroleum products to Iran, and (4) development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Directs the President to impose five or more specified sanctions on a person that knowingly participates in certain petroleum resource development joint ventures outside of Iran if the Iranian government is a substantial partner or investor in the joint venture, or if Iran could, through such joint venture, receive new technology or equipment that could significantly contribute to its development of petroleum resources in Iran. Exempts from such sanctions a person withdrawing from the joint venture within 180 days after enactment of this Act. Directs the President to impose five or more specified sanctions on a person that knowingly sells, leases, or provides to Iran certain petroleum and infrastructure development-related resources goods, services, technology, or support: (1) any of which has a fair market value of $1 million or more; or (2) that, during a 12-month period, have an aggregate fair market value of $5 million or more. Directs the President to impose five or more specified sanctions on a person that knowingly sells, leases, or provides to Iran certain petrochemical development-related goods, services, technology, or support: (1) any of which has a fair market value of $250,000 or more; or (2) that, during a 12-month period, have an aggregate fair market value of $1 million or more. (Sec. 202) Directs the President, if there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products produced in countries other than Iran to permit purchasers of Iranian petroleum and petroleum products to reduce significantly their purchases from Iran, to impose five or more specified sanctions on a person that: (1) is a controlling beneficial owner of a vessel, or otherwise owns, operates, or insures a vessel that was used to transport crude oil from Iran to another country; or (2) if a controlling beneficial owner, had actual knowledge of the vessel's use, or if an owner, operator, or insurer, knew or should have known of the vessel's use. Exempts from such sanctions a country that is exempt from National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 sanctions because it is significantly reducing Iranian purchases. Directs the President to impose five or more specified sanctions on a person: (1) that is a controlling beneficial owner of a vessel, or otherwise owns, operates, or insures a vessel that was used to transport crude oil from Iran to another country; and (2) if a controlling beneficial owner, had actual knowledge of the vessel's use, or if an owner, operator, or insurer, knew or should have known of the vessel's use. Directs the President to impose five or more specified sanctions on a person that is a controlling beneficial owner or otherwise owns, operates, or controls a vessel that conceals the Iranian origin of transported crude oil or refined petroleum products, including by: (1) permitting the vessel's operator to suspend the vessel's satellite tracking device; or (2) concealing the ownership, operation, or control of the vessel by the government of Iran, the National Iranian Tanker Company or the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, or any other Iranian-owned or-controlled entity. Authorizes the President to ban such ships from entering a port in the United States for up to two years. Prohibits the President from imposing sanctions pursuant to this section on a person that provides underwriting services or insurance or reinsurance if such person has exercised due diligence in establishing policies and controls to ensure that the person does not provide underwriting services or insurance or reinsurance for the transportation of Iranian crude oil or refined petroleum products in a manner for which sanctions may be imposed. (Sec. 203) Directs the President to impose five or more specified sanctions on a person that exported, transferred, or otherwise facilitated the transshipment of goods, services, or technology to any other person and: (1) knew or should have known that such action would likely result in another person providing the goods, services, or technology to Iran; and (2) the export, transfer, transshipment, or other provision of such goods, services, or technology would contribute materially to Iran's ability to acquire or develop chemical, biological, nuclear, or advanced conventional weapons. Directs the President to impose five or more specified sanctions on a person that knowingly participated in certain joint ventures with Iran's government, Iranian entities, or persons acting for or on behalf of Iran in the mining, production, or transportation of uranium. Exempts from such sanctions a person that withdraws from the joint venture within 180 days after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 204) Authorizes the President to: (1) prohibit any U.S. person from investing in or purchasing significant amounts of equity or debt instruments of a sanctioned person; (2) direct the Secretary of State to exclude from the United States an alien who is a corporate officer, principal, or controlling shareholder in a sanctioned firm; and (3) impose sanctions against the principal executive officer or other principal executive officers of a sanctioned firm. (Sec. 205) Authorizes the President to: (1) waive energy sector sanctions on a case-by-case basis for not more than one year if essential to U.S. national security interests, (2) waive WMD/military-related sanctions on a case-by-case basis for not more than one year if vital to U.S. national security interests, and (3) extend such waivers for additional one-year periods. (Sec. 206) Directs the Secretary to brief Congress every 120 days on efforts to implement the Act. (Sec. 207) Defines specified terms. (Sec. 208) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) Iran's energy sector remains a zone of proliferation concern since Iran continues to divert substantial petroleum revenues to finance its illicit nuclear and missile activities, and (2) the President should apply the full range of sanctions to address the Iranian threat. Subtitle B: Additional Measures Relating to Sanctions Against Iran - (Sec. 211) Directs the President to block the property and property interests in the United States or under the control of a U.S. person of a person that knowingly provides ships, insurance or reinsurance, or other shipping services for transportation of goods that materially contribute to Iran's proliferation of WMD program or its terrorism-related activities. Authorizes the President to waive such provisions if vital to U.S. national security interests. (Sec. 212) Directs the President to impose five or more specified sanctions on a person that provides underwriting services or insurance or reinsurance for the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), or a successor entity.
