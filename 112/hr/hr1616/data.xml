  <summary>4/15/2011--Introduced.
Workforce Investments through Local Libraries Act or WILL Act - Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to revise requirements for member composition of state and local workforce investment boards to include individuals and organizations representing public libraries. Requires state workforce investment plans to include a description of the procedures states will take to assure coordination of and avoid duplication among employment, training, and literacy services carried out by public libraries. Requires local workforce investment plans similarly to describe how local boards will coordinate investment activities carried out in the local area with such services carried out by public libraries. Allows a human resource program operated by a one-stop partner to include employment, training, and literacy services carried out by public libraries. Allows public libraries, among other appropriate entities, to contract with the one-stop delivery system to deliver intensive services for employment and training for adults and dislocated workers supported by workforce investment funds. Allows demonstration and pilot, multiservice, research, and multistate projects of the Department of Labor for providing employment opportunities and training services to individuals to include the establishment of employment resource centers in public libraries to provide unemployed and underemployed individuals access to such opportunities and services.</summary>
