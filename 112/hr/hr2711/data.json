Defines a non-COLA year as a 12-month period for which: (1) a cost-of-living adjustment is generally provided under the pertinent program in relation to an index; but (2) such an adjustment does not take effect by reason of the performance of that index. Makes $250 the payment for any non-COLA year: (1) ending with or during 2011 or 2011, and (2) any non-COLA year not immediately preceded by another non-COLA year. Makes the payment for any non-COLA year ending after 2011 which is immediately preceded by another non-COLA year the same as the payment for that immediately preceding non-COLA year, plus $50."
