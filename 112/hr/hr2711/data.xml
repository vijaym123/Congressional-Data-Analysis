  <summary>7/29/2011--Introduced.
Seniors Protection Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, for each non-cost-of-living (non-COLA) year, to disburse a cash payment to recipients of Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) under title XVI of the Social Security Act, railroad retirement benefits, and veterans disability compensation or pension benefits. Defines a non-COLA year as a 12-month period for which: (1) a cost-of-living adjustment is generally provided under the pertinent program in relation to an index; but (2) such an adjustment does not take effect by reason of the performance of that index. Makes $250 the payment for any non-COLA year: (1) ending with or during 2011 or 2011, and (2) any non-COLA year not immediately preceded by another non-COLA year. Makes the payment for any non-COLA year ending after 2011 which is immediately preceded by another non-COLA year the same as the payment for that immediately preceding non-COLA year, plus $50.</summary>
