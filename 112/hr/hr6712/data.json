    "text": "Elgin Stafford Mental Illness Information Disclosure Act of 2012 or Elgin's Law - Requires a health care professional to disclose to a parent of a covered individual being treated for a mental illness any information regarding the mental illness and treatment which may be useful for the parent's appropriate involvement with the treatment. Excludes exceptional circumstances where parental involvement would be counter-productive to treatment. Makes such a disclosure permissible under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as not requiring consent of the covered individual. Applies this Act to a minor child, an uninsured adult under age 26, or an adult under age 26 who is included as a dependent under the parent's health benefits coverage."
