    "text": "Next Generation 9-1-1 Advancement Act of 2011 - Revises the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to provide for matching grants (with a federal share of up to 80%), through October 1, 2017, to eligible state or local governments or tribal organizations for: (1) implementing and operating 9-1-1 and E9-1-1 services, migrating to an IP-enabled emergency network, and adopting and operating Next Generation 9-1-1 services and applications; (2) implementing IP-enabled emergency services and applications enabled by Next Generation 9-1-1 services, including IP backbone networks and application layer software infrastructure needed to interconnect emergency response organizations; and (3) training public safety personnel. Directs the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce and the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to establish a 9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office. Defines \"E9-1-1 services\" as both phase I and II enhanced 9-1-1 services as described in specified Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. Defines \"Next Generation 9-1-1 services\" to mean an IP-based system comprised of hardware, software, data, and operational policies and procedures that: (1) provides standardized interfaces from emergency call and message services to support emergency communications; (2) processes all types of emergency calls, including voice, data, and multimedia information; (3) acquires and integrates additional emergency call data useful to call routing and handling; (4) delivers the emergency calls, messages, and data to the appropriate public safety answering point and other appropriate emergency entities; (5) supports data or video communications needs for coordinated incident response and management; or (6) provides broadband service to public safety answering points or other first responder entities. Provides immunity and liability protection, to the extent consistent with specified provisions of the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999, to a provider or user of Next Generation 9-1-1 services, a public safety answering point, and the officers, directors, employees, vendors, agents, and any authorizing government entity for: (1) releasing subscriber information related to emergency calls or services; and (2) other matters pertaining to 9-1-1, E9-1-1, or Next Generation 9-1-1 services, including the use or provision of such services. Directs the FCC to: (1) initiate a proceeding to create a specialized Do-Not-Call registry for public safety answering points, and (2) establish penalties and fines for autodialing (robocalls) and related violations."
