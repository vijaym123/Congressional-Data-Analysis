Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a program to assess information relating to device recalls and use such information to proactively identify strategies for mitigating health risks presented by defective or unsafe devices, (2) clarify procedures for conducting device recall audit checks to improve the ability of investigators to perform those checks in a consistent manner, (3) develop detailed criteria for assessing whether a person performing a device recall has performed an effective correction or action plan for the recall, and (4) document the basis for each Food and Drug Administration (FDA) termination of a device recall."
