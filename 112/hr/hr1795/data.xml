  <summary>5/6/2011--Introduced.
Providing Gas Price Relief Through Public Transportation Act of 2011 - Authorizes additional FY2011-FY2012 appropriations for formula grants to both urbanized and nonurbanized areas for the operating and capital costs of public transportation (including intercity bus service) equipment and facilities, but only if grant recipients: (1) reduce or do not increase fares, (2) do not reduce service, (3) expand service, (4) acquire clean fuel or alternative fuel vehicle-related equipment or facilities, or (5) establish or expand commuter matching services. Requires a 100% federal share of a grant project involving acquisition of clean fuel or alternative fuel vehicle-related equipment or facilities to comply with the Clean Air Act. Amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to direct the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to issue guidance on nationwide implementation of the transit pass transportation fringe benefits program for federal employees. Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program to carry out vanpool demonstration projects.</summary>
