  <summary>5/15/2012--Introduced.
Military Family Home Protection Act - Amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to allow a court, in an action to enforce an obligation on real or personal property secured by a mortgage against a servicemember on active duty, a totally disabled veteran, or the surviving spouse of a member who died during military service, to either: (1) stay the proceedings for a period of time as justice and equity require, or (2) adjust the obligation to preserve the interests of all parties. Prohibits the sale, foreclosure, or seizure of the subject property for the service period, as well as the 12-month period after: (1) the servicemember is discharged or redeployed from a contingency operation, (2) the veteran is retired, or (3) the death of the servicemember (in the case of a surviving spouse). Increases the civil penalties for violations of the sale or foreclosure prohibitions. Prohibits an individual from being denied or refused credit solely by reason of eligibility for relief under this Act. Requires each lending institution acting as a creditor to such servicemember, veteran, or surviving spouse to designate an employee responsible for ensuring the institution's compliance with the requirements of this Act. Requires any such institution that had prior annual assets of $10 billion or more to maintain on its primary website a toll-free number for information with respect to the protections afforded under this Act.</summary>
