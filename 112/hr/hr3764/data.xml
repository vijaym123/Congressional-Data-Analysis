Ensuring Quality Education for Veterans Act - Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require proprietary institutions of higher education to derive not less than 10% of their revenue from sources other than title IV or the educational assistance programs of the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA), or become ineligible for title IV funding and participation in those programs. (Currently, this 90/10 rule requires these schools to derive not less than 10% of their revenue from sources other than title IV or become ineligible for title IV funding.)</summary>
