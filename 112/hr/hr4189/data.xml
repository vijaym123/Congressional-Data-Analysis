  <summary>3/8/2012--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that programs broadcast by the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) should reflect the values, including equality, freedom, and service, to which members of the Armed Forces and Americans aspire, and that the AFRTS should avoid airing programming that has a history of being contrary to such values. Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to certify annually to Congress that such AFRTS-broadcast programming represents best-faith efforts to communicate the DOD's policies, priorities, programs, goals, and initiatives while avoiding airing programming with values contrary to Armed Forces and U.S. values.</summary>
