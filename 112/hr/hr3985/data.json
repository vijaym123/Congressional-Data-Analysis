(Under current law, the SBA mentor-protege program is limited to small businesses participating in the section 8(a) guaranteed loan program.) Prohibits a federal department or agency from carrying out a mentor-protege program for small businesses unless the head of such department or agency submits a program plan to the Administrator and the Administrator approves it. Requires the Administrator to approve or disapprove a plan based on whether the proposed program: (1) will assist proteges to compete for federal prime contracts and subcontracts, and (2) complies with program regulations as issued by the Administrator under this Act."
