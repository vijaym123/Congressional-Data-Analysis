  <summary>2/8/2012--Introduced.
Building Better Business Partnerships Act of 2012 - Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish a mentor-protege program for all small businesses. (Under current law, the SBA mentor-protege program is limited to small businesses participating in the section 8(a) guaranteed loan program.) Prohibits a federal department or agency from carrying out a mentor-protege program for small businesses unless the head of such department or agency submits a program plan to the Administrator and the Administrator approves it. Requires the Administrator to approve or disapprove a plan based on whether the proposed program: (1) will assist proteges to compete for federal prime contracts and subcontracts, and (2) complies with program regulations as issued by the Administrator under this Act.</summary>
