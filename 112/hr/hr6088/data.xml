Total Repeal of the Unfair Taxes on Healthcare Act of 2012 or the TRUTH Act of 2012 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to health care provisions added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, to repeal: (1) the excise tax on the excess benefit from certain high cost employer-sponsored health coverage plans; (2) the excise tax on net investment income in the Medicare taxable base; (3) the prohibition against payments from health flexible spending arrangements, health savings accounts (HSAs), and Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs) for over-the-counter drugs; (4) the increased penalty on distributions from an HSA or Archer MSA not used for qualified medical expenses; (5) the limitation on annual salary reduction contributions by an employee to a health flexible spending arrangement under a cafeteria plan; (6) the increase in the income threshold for claiming an itemized deduction for medical expenses; (7) the excise tax on indoor tanning services; (8) the requirement that individuals maintain minimal essential health care coverage; and (9) the excise tax on medical devices.
