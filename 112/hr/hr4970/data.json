Authorizes the Secretary to use not more than 20% of funds available under this title for research and evaluation of: (1) grants awarded under this title; and (2) other training for health professionals and effective interventions in the health care setting that prevent domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault across the lifespan, prevent the health effects of such violence, and improve the safety and health of individuals who are currently being victimized. Allows research grant funds to be used to research the impact of adverse childhood experiences on adult experience with domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and adult health outcomes, including how to reduce or prevent the impact of adverse childhood experiences through the health care setting.

Title VI: Safe Homes for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking - (Sec. 601) Amends VAWA with respect to housing rights of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Prohibits denial or termination of housing assistance on the basis of being such a victim under specified federal housing programs (covered programs), including the low-income housing tax credit program, if the applicant or tenant otherwise qualifies for such admission, assistance, participation, or occupancy. Prohibits denial of assistance, tenancy, or occupancy rights to assisted housing based solely on certain criminal activity directly related to domestic violence engaged in by a member of the individual's household or by any guest or other person under the individual's control, if the tenant or an affiliated individual is the victim or threatened victim. Defines \"affiliated individual\" as: (1) a spouse, parent, brother, sister, or child of that individual, or someone to whom such individual stands in loco parentis; or (2) any other individual, tenant, or lawful occupant living in the individual's household. Allows a public housing agency (PHA) or an owner or manager of assisted housing to bifurcate a housing lease in order to evict, remove, or terminate assistance to any tenant or lawful occupant who engages in criminal activity directly relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against an affiliated individual or other individual, without evicting or otherwise penalizing a victim of such criminal activity who is also a tenant or lawful occupant. Requires specified accommodation of any tenants remaining after the eviction of the sole tenant eligible to receive assistance under a covered housing program. Authorizes a PHA or an owner or manager of assisted housing to: (1) require certified documentation from any applicant claiming protection under this Act, or (2) deny or terminate any assistance if such documentation is not produced. Requires each appropriate agency to adopt a model emergency relocation and transfer plan, meeting specified criteria, for PHAs and owners or managers of assisted housing to use voluntarily in allowing tenants who are victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to relocate or transfer to another available and safe dwelling unit of assisted housing. Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish policies and procedures under which a victim requesting such a transfer may receive section 8 (voucher program) assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Makes conforming amendments to the United States Housing Act of 1937. (Sec. 602) Revises eligibility requirements for transitional housing assistance grants for child victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to specify that any victims are eligible. Extends the authorization of appropriations for such grants, but at decreased levels, for FY2013-FY2017. (Sec. 603) Extends the authorization of appropriations, but also at decreased levels, for FY2013-FY2017 for: (1) collaborative grants to increase the long-term stability of victims, and (2) grants to combat violence against women in public and assisted housing. Title VII: Economic Security for Victims of Violence - (Sec. 701) Amends VAWA to extend through FY2017 the authorization of appropriations for the grant program to establish and operate a national resource center on workplace responses to assist victims of domestic and sexual violence. Title VIII: Immigration Provisions - (Sec. 801) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to consider any credible relevant evidence, including evidence submitted by an accused U.S. national or permanent resident, in adjudicating an application for cancellation of removal by an alien who has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty. Provides that: (1) permanent resident self-petitions for a battered spouse, child, or parent shall be adjudicated at local U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services offices and shall include an in-person interview with the petitioning alien; (2) a petition shall not be granted unless it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence; (3) a local office shall determine whether any federal, state, territorial, tribal, or local law enforcement agency has undertaken an investigation or prosecution of the abusive conduct alleged by the self-petitioning alien, and if so, shall obtain and use appropriate information in adjudicating the self-petition; and (4) adjudication of the self-petition shall be stayed pending the conclusion of such an investigation or prosecution. (Sec. 802) Requires that a certification for a nonimmigrant U-visa (victims of certain crimes) confirm under oath that the criminal activity is under investigation or a prosecution has commenced and that the alien seeking a U-visa has provided law enforcement with information that will assist in identifying the responsible criminals (unless their identity is already known). (Sec. 803) Requires a petition filed by a U.S. citizen for a nonimmigrant K-visa (fiancee/fiance) to contain information on whether the petitioner has been convicted of attempting to commit abuse or stalking and whether any permanent protection or restraining orders have been issued against such petitioner. (Sec. 804) Directs the Attorney General to report to Congress regarding the (DOJ component responsible for prosecuting violations of the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005. Amends the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005 to prohibit an international marriage broker from providing any individual or entity with personal contact information about an individual under the age of 18. Requires a broker to obtain, and keep for five years, a valid copy of each foreign national client's birth certificate or other official proof of age documented by the appropriate government entity. (Sec. 805) Requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report to Congress on the approval processes for U-visa petitions and self-petitions for permanent residence filed by battered aliens in order to assess fraud and abuse safeguards. (Sec. 806) Limits authority to adjust U-visa recipients to permanent resident status to circumstances where the criminal perpetrator was an alien, was convicted of the crime that was the basis for the U-visa's issuance, and was removed to the same home country as the victim. (Sec. 807) Requires DHS to report to Congress each year regarding: (1) the U-visa program, the T-visa program (victims of trafficking) and the self-petition process for battered aliens; and (2) each type of criminal activity by reason of which aliens received U-visas. (Sec. 808) Makes the surviving child of an alien who was a VAWA self-petitioner who filed a pending or approved petition for classification or application for status adjustment or other benefit eligible for lawful permanent resident status under such alien's petition. (Sec. 809) Excludes from the public charge bar to admission an alien who is: (1) a VAWA self-petitioner, (2) a U-visa applicant, or (3) a battered spouse or child. (Sec. 810) States that an unmarried alien who seeks to accompany, or follow to join, a parent granted U-visa status who was under 21 years of age on the date on which the parent petitioned for such status shall continue to be classified as a child if the alien attains 21 years of age after the parent's petition was filed but while it was pending. (Sec. 811) Extends the conditions under which the waiver of the two-year waiting period for permanent resident status application may be granted to a battered alien spouse. (Sec. 812) Authorizes DOJ, the Department of State, and DHS to disclose information to national security officials solely for national security use in a manner that protects the confidentiality of such information. (Sec. 813) Requires GAO to report to Congress on the adjudication of U-visa petitions. (Sec. 814) Authorizes DOJ, in determining whether the conviction of an alien on grounds of domestic violence meets the deportation requirement, to consider other evidence such as sentencing reports and police reports in circumstances where the conviction records do not conclusively answer whether such requirement has been met. Title IX: Safety for Indian Women - (Sec. 901) Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include sex trafficking as a target of the grants to Indian tribal governments to combat violent crime against Indian women.
