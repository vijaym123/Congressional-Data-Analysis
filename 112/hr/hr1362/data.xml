  <summary>4/4/2011--Introduced.
Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Secretary of Defense (DOD), and the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) in the case of the Coast Guard, amounts necessary to provide pay and allowances to members of the Armed Forces, including the reserves, who perform active service during any funding gap during FY2011 when interim or full-year appropriations for the military personnel accounts have not been enacted. Requires: (1) such members to continue to be paid even if the debt of the U.S. government reaches its statutory limit, and (2) such pay obligation to take priority over all other government obligations.</summary>
