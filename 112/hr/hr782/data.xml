  <summary>2/17/2011--Introduced.
State Health Care Flexibility Act of 2011 - Authorizes a state to opt out of the application of certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) with respect to health insurance coverage within the state by: (1) enacting a law that expresses the intent of the state to opt out of any or all of such provisions, lists such provisions, and expresses the intent of the state to continue to administer health care coverage-related laws as in effect in the state on March 22, 2010, or provides for the implementation of related state laws enacted after such date; and (2) notifying the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Secretary of the Treasury that such a state law was enacted. Includes among PPACA provisions that may be made inapplicable within a state provisions related to health coverage, essential health benefits, health insurance exchanges, alternative health plans established by states, individual and employer health coverage requirements, interoperable protocols for enrollment in federal and state health and human service programs, and expansion of Medicaid coverage.</summary>
