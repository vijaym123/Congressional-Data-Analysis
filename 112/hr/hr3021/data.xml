  <summary>9/22/2011--Introduced.
Community Transit Promotion Act of 2011 - Revises cost-sharing requirements for Department of Transportation (DOT) grants for job access service projects (designed to transport welfare recipients and eligible low-income individuals to and from jobs and employment-related activities), reverse commute projects (designed to transport residents of urbanized areas and other than urbanized areas to suburban employment opportunities), and new freedom program projects (that assist individuals with disabilities with public transportation services and alternatives, including transportation to and from jobs and employment support services). Increases the maximum operating assistance grant amount for such projects from 50% to 80% of the net operating project costs. Adds fare box revenues and service agreements with a transit provider as sources for the remainder of net project costs.</summary>
