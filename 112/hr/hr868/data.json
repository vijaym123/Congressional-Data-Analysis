Requires such measures to include methods: (1) by which administrative records of a nongovernmental organization may be used to enumerate organization members residing overseas as of the census date if such records satisfy the Secretary's criteria, and (2) under which an international \"Be Counted\" form may be completed at a U.S. embassy by Americans residing overseas."
