    "text": "Sugar Loaf Fire Protection District Land Exchange Act - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), if the Sugar Loaf Fire Protection District of Boulder, Colorado, offers to convey non-federal land in unincorporated Boulder County and the offer is acceptable to the Secretary, to accept the offer and to convey federal land in the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests in Colorado. Applies provisions of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 relating to the exchange of public lands and interests within the National Forest System to the land exchange authorized under this Act, except that: (1) the Secretary may accept a cash equalization payment in excess of 25% of the value of the federal land; and (2) the District shall pay costs relating to any land surveys and appraisals of the federal and non-federal lands and enter into an agreement that allocates any other administrative costs between the Secretary and the District. Expresses the intent of Congress that such land exchange be completed within one year of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to offer to sell the federal land to the District if the exchange is not completed by such deadline. Permits the Secretary to offer to sell such land to the District for its fair market value. Requires the acquired non-federal land to become part of the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests. Revokes any public orders withdrawing the federal land from entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws to the extent necessary to permit the conveyance of the federal land to the District. Withdraws such land on the date of enactment, if it is not already withdrawn or segregated from entry and appropriation under the public land laws and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, until it is conveyed to the District."
