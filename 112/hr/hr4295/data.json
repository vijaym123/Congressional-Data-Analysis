    "text": "Consolidate Heavy-handed and Outdated Programs Act of 2012 - Consolidates the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Department of Energy and the Environment (DEE), with the primary mission of ensuring U.S. security and prosperity by: (1) protecting human health; (2) safeguarding the natural environment; and (3) addressing U.S. energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions. Transfers to the DEE Secretary all of the functions of the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of Energy. Establishes within the Department: (1) an Energy and Environmental Information Administration, (2) an Office of Science, (3) an Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, (4) an Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, and (5) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as an independent regulatory commission. Transfers to the Commission specified functions of the Federal Power Commission (FPC). Preserves the Southeastern Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, and the Bonneville Power Administration as distinct organizational entities within DEE, each headed by an Administrator. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish policy for the National Nuclear Security Administration, (2) assess annually the vulnerability of Department's facilities to terrorist attack, and (3) establish an enterprise-wide strategic sourcing program to improve efficiencies and economies in EPA's acquisition programs. Requires the President to: (1) submit a proposed National Energy Policy Plan to Congress by April 1, 2013, and biennially thereafter; and (2) issue an executive order that provides for administrative cost savings across the federal government. Repeals provisions providing for the weatherization assistance program, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program, sustainable energy resources for consumers grants, the low income community energy efficiency pilot program, the Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional Natural Gas and Other Petroleum Resources Research and Development Program, the fossil energy research and development program, state energy conservation plans, diesel emissions reduction grants, and grants to states for radon programs. Rescinds specified unobligated balances of the amounts made available for energy efficiency and renewable energy. Terminates the state water pollution control revolving funds program, grants for water pollution control programs, nonpoint source management programs, the state drinking water revolving loan funds program, public water system supervision programs, the state underground injection control program, and the diesel emissions reduction grant program. Terminates EPA's grant program for coastal recreation water quality monitoring and notification, Clean Automotive Technology program, targeted watershed grants program, performance partnership grants program, U.S. Mexico border water infrastructure program, tribal assistance grants programs, Chemical Risk Management Fibers program, Environmental Education program, and program to automatically transfer funds from its Hazardous Substance Superfund account to other federal agencies. Limits appropriations available: (1) for activities within DOE's fossil energy research and development account for FY2013, (2) to carry out the Second Line of Defense radiation detection equipment installation activities, and (3) to carry out EPA's Superfund remedial program. Prohibits funds from being made available for the construction of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement facility in FY2013-FY2017. Prohibits the Secretary from providing in FY2013-FY2017: (1) grants to communities to develop plans and implement projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions; (2) targeted airshed grants to California; and (3) grants for the construction of drinking water, wastewater, or storm water infrastructure or for water quality protection. Limits the amount that the Secretary may transfer to the Great Lakes Initiative."
