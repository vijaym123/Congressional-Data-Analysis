Entitles each Senator, House Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, and Resident Representative to nominate three persons each year. Requires nominees to be citizens or nationals of the United States and meet any minimum requirements established by the Secretary of the respective department in which the Coast Guard is operating.
