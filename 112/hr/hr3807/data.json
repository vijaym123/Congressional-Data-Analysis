Establishes the amount of such tax at the lesser of 50 cents per barrel or such amount as the Secretary of the Treasury estimates would result in aggregate revenue for a fiscal year equal to the excess of $5.1 billion over the amount appropriated for such fiscal year for providing assistance under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. Establishes in the Treasury the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program Trust Fund (LIHEAP Trust Fund) to provide assistance under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. Limits the amount of such assistance to $5.1 billion in any fiscal year. Dedicates revenues from the tax on oil under this Act to such Fund."
