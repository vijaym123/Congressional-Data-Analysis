Makes such limitation inapplicable only when the Incident Commander determines: (1) that privately contracted fixed-wing aerial firefighting aircraft are unavailable, (2) it is necessary for military fixed-wing aerial firefighting aircraft including MAFFS units to perform an initial airborne response, or (3) that military fixed-wing aerial firefighting aircraft including MAFFS units are needed to supplement privately contracted fixed-wing aerial firefighting aircraft."
