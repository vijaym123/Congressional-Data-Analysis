Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to direct the Secretary to provide direct loans and loan guarantees for qualified rail projects. Authorizes the Secretary to make secured loans, loan guarantees, or lines of credit for such projects. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance to: (1) states to identify transportation-oriented development opportunities, (2) states and regions outside the Northeast Corridor to establish Regional Advisory Committees and identify stations and potential stations within the region to maximize development and commercial revenue generation to support financially the development of a high performance rail passenger corridor, and (3) states and entities along the Northeast Corridor to establish a Northeast Corridor Transportation-Oriented Development Working Group and identify Northeast Corridor stations and potential stations to maximize development and commercial revenue generation to support financially the creation of a true high-speed rail corridor in the Northeast Corridor."
