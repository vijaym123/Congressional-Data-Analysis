Sets forth the maximum number of eligible veteran participants and the authorized forms of education and training. Requires a joint report from such Secretaries to the congressional veterans committees on such assistance. Title II: Improving the Transition Assistance Program - (Sec. 201) Revises guidelines for stationing Transition Assistance Program (TAP) personnel to require the Secretary to contract with a private entity or entities to provide specified counseling, employment, and training services. (Under current law, the Secretary is required to station such personnel at member transition assistance offices located on military installations.) Requires such contract to be entered into within 24 months after the enactment of this Act. (Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) and the Secretary of the Transportation (DOT) to require participation of all members eligible for employment assistance and other transitional services unless a documented urgent operational requirement prevents attendance or a member declines due to post-service employment or acceptance to an education program. (Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to: (1) report to the veterans committees on TAP, including the number of individuals who participated within 30, 90, and 180 days after separation; and (2) contract with a small business owned and controlled by veterans or service-disabled veterans for a TAP audit at least every three years. Requires audit results to be submitted to the Secretaries of Labor, DOD, and VA, as well as the veterans committees. (Sec. 204) Requires the Secretaries of Labor to develop a method to assess the outcomes of individuals participating in TAP. (Sec. 205) Directs the Comptroller General (CG) to review TAP, and submit review results to Congress.
