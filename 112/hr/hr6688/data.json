    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2012-12-19", 
    "text": "Averting the Fiscal Cliff Act - Title I: Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act - Subtitle A: Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act - Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act of 2012 - Makes permanent: (1) the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, and (2) provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 that reduce tax rates on capital gain and dividend income. Extends through 2013 the estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer provisions of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend through 2013: (1) the increased expensing allowance for depreciable business assets, and (2) the increased alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption amount for individual taxpayers. Subtitle B: Pathway to Job Creation Through a Simpler, Fairer Tax Code Act - Pathway to Job Creation through a Simpler, Fairer Tax Code Act of 2012 - States that the purpose of this Subtitle is to provide for the enactment of comprehensive tax reform in 2013. Defines a \"tax reform bill\" as a bill of the 113th Congress that is introduced in the House of Representatives by the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means not later than April 30, 2013 (or the first legislative day thereafter if the House is not in session on that day), the title of which is \"a bill to provide for comprehensive tax reform.\" Requires the chair of the Joint Committee on Taxation to notify the House and Senate upon determining that such an introduced bill contains proposals to: (1) consolidate the 6 current individual income tax brackets into a maximum of 2 brackets (of 10% and not higher than 25%), (2) reduce the corporate income tax rate to not more than 25%, (3) repeal the alternative minimum tax (AMT), (4) broaden the tax base to maintain revenue between 18% and 19% of the economy, and (5) change from a worldwide to a territorial system of taxation. Provides for expedited consideration of such bill in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Title II: Sequestration Replacement Act - Subtitle A: Agriculture - Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 2012 - Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to terminate the increase in the value of supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP, formerly the food stamp program) benefits for Puerto Rico and American Samoa on the date of enactment of the Averting the Fiscal Cliff Act. Amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to limit categorical SNAP eligibility to households receiving specified other program benefits in cash. Eliminates the requirement that a state agency using a standard utility allowance provide such allowance to a household that receives assistance under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 or other energy assistance program if such household incurs out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses exceeding such assistance. Eliminates: (1) administrative cost sharing to states for certain employment and training programs, (2) state bonus programs for effective SNAP administration, and (3) indexing for the nutrition education and obesity prevention grant program. Reduces FY2013 funding for employment and training programs. Authorizes FY2013 appropriations to carry out the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008. States that this title and the amendments made by this title shall take effect on enactment of this Act, and shall apply only with respect to certification periods that begin on or after such date. Subtitle B: Committee on Energy and Commerce - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to repeal provisions: (1) appropriating funds to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to states for activities (including planning activities) related to establishing an American Health Benefit Exchange (a state health insurance exchange), (2) establishing and appropriating funds to the Prevention and Public Health Fund (a Fund to provide for expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs to improve health and help restrain the rate of growth in private and public sector health care costs), and (3) appropriating funds for the establishment and operation of the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program (designed to foster the creation of qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers to offer qualified health plans in the individual and small group markets). Rescinds any unobligated balance appropriated under such provisions. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) extend the reduction of the threshold level of permissible state taxes on health care providers before federal funding to the state for Medicaid is reduced; (2) reduce the state disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotment for FY2022; and (3) repeal provisions prohibiting states from reducing eligibility levels for Medicaid. Amends SSA title XXI (Children's Health Insurance Program) (CHIP) to repeal provisions prohibiting states from reducing eligibility levels for CHIP. Repeals provisions that increased Medicaid payments to territories though FY2019. Decreases the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. Repeals provisions providing bonus payments to states for enrollment and retention programs for children covered under Medicaid and CHIP. Subtitle C: Financial Services -- Amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) to repeal Title II (Orderly Liquidation Authority), including the Orderly Liquidation Fund, and to restore any federal law amended by it as if title II of Dodd-Frank had not been enacted.
