Expands executive authority to reorganize agencies by allowing: (1) the renaming of an existing executive department, (2) the abolition or transfer of an executive department or independent regulatory agency, or (3) the consolidation of two or more executive departments or two or more independent regulatory agencies. Allows a provision in a reorganization plan to take effect only if such plan is transmitted to Congress within two years of the enactment of this Act and is an efficiency-enhancing plan."
