  <summary>6/15/2011--Introduced.
Home Inspection Act of 2011 - Directs the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) of the Federal Reserve System to prescribe regulations to prohibit any lender from making any federally related mortgage loan under which a home inspection is conducted in connection with settlement of the mortgage loan unless the inspection is conducted by a home inspector licensed, certified, approved, or otherwise regulated by the inspector's home state or the state in which the real property is located. Amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, to direct the CFPB to include home inspection information in settlement forms.</summary>
