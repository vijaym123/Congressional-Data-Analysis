  <summary>11/23/2011--Public Law.
Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to toll, during active-duty service abroad in the Armed Forces, the 90-day periods of time for an alien spouse or petitioning spouse to file a petition and appear for an interview to remove the conditional basis for permanent resident status. States that: (1) at the petitioner's option the petition may be filed during such active-duty service at any time after commencement of the 90-day petition period, and (2) the tolling of the 90-day interview period shall not be construed to prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) from waiving the interview requirement.</summary>
