Requires any sanction to compensate parties injured by the conduct in question. Removes a provision that prohibits filing a motion for sanctions if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days after service or within another time the court sets. Authorizes the court to impose additional sanctions, including striking the pleadings, dismissing the suit, nonmonetary directives, or penalty payments if warranted for effective deterrence. Prohibits this Act from being construed as barring or impeding the assertion or development of new claims, defenses, or remedies under federal, state, or local laws, including civil rights laws, or under the Constitution."
