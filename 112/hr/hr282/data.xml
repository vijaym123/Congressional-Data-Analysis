Amends the the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to require federal contractors and subcontractors to participate in the E-Verify Program. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that the Program is applied to all of the contractor's or subcontractor's employees and not just to those performing the contract or subcontract.</summary>
