  <summary>7/22/2011--Introduced.
Eliminating Disincentives to ROTC Participation Act - Prohibits a four-year institution of higher education (IHE) from being awarded, or continuing to receive funds for performance under, a federal grant or contract unless it offers its students at least six credit hours for the successful completion of courses offered by the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program. Requires an IHE to offer its students such credit hours even if successful completion of the ROTC courses occurs elsewhere.</summary>
