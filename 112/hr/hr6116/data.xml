  <summary>12/28/2012--Public Law.
(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on November 14, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands, with respect to the judicial procedure for appealing from the decisions of courts of the Virgin Islands to courts of the United States, to remove the temporary jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to review by a writ of certiorari the final decisions of the highest court of the Virgin Islands. Authorizes final judgments or decrees rendered by the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands to be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court by writ of certiorari where the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question or where the validity of a statute of the Virgin Islands is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, or where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of, or any commission held or authority exercised under, the United States. Applies such U.S. Supreme Court reviewing authority to cases commenced on or after enactment of this Act.</summary>
