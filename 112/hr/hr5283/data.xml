  <summary>4/27/2012--Introduced.
Revises clinical trial registry data bank provisions of the Public Health Service Act to: (1) include a device or drug clinical trial whether or not it results in a positive or negative outcome, and (2) subject clinical trials funded by the Department of Defense (DOD) to requirements to certify information submissions to the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Restricts funding for a grantee and makes the grantee liable to the United States for repayment of any grant amount provided, if the grantee has not submitted clinical trial information within the 30-day correction period for noncompliance.</summary>
