  <summary>4/7/2011--Introduced.
Grassroots Rural and Small Community Water Systems Assistance Act of 2011 - Calls for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prioritize the type of technical assistance to enable small public water systems to comply with national primary drinking water regulations that small communities find is the most beneficial. Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to: (1) authorize appropriations to the Administrator of EPA for FY2011-FY2016 for such assistance; and (2) authorize the Administrator to provide such assistance to organizations providing onsite technical assistance, circuit-rider technical assistance programs, onsite and regional training, assistance with implementing source water protection plans, and assistance with implementation monitoring plans, rules, regulations, and water security enhancements. Directs the Administrator to give preference to nonprofit organizations that are determined to be the most qualified, experienced, and effective and the most supported by small community water systems.</summary>
