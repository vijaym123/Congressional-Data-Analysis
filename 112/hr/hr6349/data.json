Prohibits the waiver of the trustee fee if an individual debtor is able to pay in installments in chapter 7 cases. Repeals the requirement that, when a trustee is not serving a chapter 7 case involving an employee benefit plan, the debtor continue to perform the obligations required of the plan administrator if at the time of the commencement of the case the debtor (or a designee entity) served as the administrator. Repeals the duty of a trustee, in such a circumstance, to continue to perform such administrative obligations."
