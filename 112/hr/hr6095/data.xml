Morris Soskil Path to the Purple Heart Act - Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned, in the case of an individual who served as a member of the Armed Forces during World War II and whose service records are incomplete because of damage while in the possession of the Department of Defense (DOD), to provide an exception to the standards for awarding the Purple Heart and consider unofficial sources of information, including eyewitness statements, to determine whether the individual is so eligible as a member killed or wounded in action as the result of an enemy act. Directs the Secretary of Defense to make such an award based upon a positive determination by the Secretary concerned. Allows such an award to be made posthumously.</summary>
