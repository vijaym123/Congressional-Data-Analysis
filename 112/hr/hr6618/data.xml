Requires the Committee to: (1) gather views from federal, state, local, and tribal agencies that work to support public safety and justice; (2) recommend to the Attorney General measures to improve the administration of justice and protect the public by promoting practices and technologies for database interoperability and the secure sharing of justice and public safety information between local, state, and tribal governments and the federal government; and (3) report annually on issues considered and recommendations made. Expresses the sense of Congress that state, local, and tribal governments and other relevant entities should use the recommendations developed by the Committee to evaluate, improve, and develop effective strategies and technologies to improve public safety and information sharing. Directs the Attorney General to require any applicant for a funding solicitation from the Department of Justice (DOJ) for the implementation of an information sharing solution to include within the application: (1) how the solution would comply with Committee standards, or (2) the reason for any non-compliance with such standards. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) review the state of information sharing between state, local, and tribal corrections and law enforcement agencies and the federal government; and (2) identify barriers and best practices and assess ways for information sharing to improve the awareness and safety of law enforcement and corrections officials.</summary>
