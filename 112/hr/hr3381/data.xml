  <summary>11/4/2011--Introduced.
Viral Hepatitis Testing Act of 2011 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to carry out surveillance, education, and testing programs with respect to hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections. Requires the Secretary to establish a national system with respect to HBV and HCV to: (1) determine the prevalence of such infections, (2) carry out testing programs to increase the number of individuals who are aware of their infection, (3) disseminate public information and education programs for the detection and control of such infections, (4) provide referrals for counseling and medical treatment and ensure the provision of follow-up services, and (5) improve the training of health professionals in the treatment of such infections. Directs the Secretary to determine the populations that are considered at high risk. Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to complete the revision of CDC guidelines for screening individuals with HCV, taking into account: (1) the effectiveness issues that have been raised with respect to the current CDC guidelines for screening, (2) the importance of responding to the perception that receiving such screening may be stigmatizing, and (3) whether age-based screening would be effective. Requires the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to: (1) develop HCV screening recommendations, taking into account the guidelines established by CDC and new and improved treatments for HCV; and (2) develop HBV screening recommendations, taking into account the guidelines the CDC recommended in 2008.</summary>
