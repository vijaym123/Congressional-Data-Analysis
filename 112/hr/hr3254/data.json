    "text": "Affordable Communities Employment Act of 2011 - Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 with respect to housing and community development programs directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly recipients of government housing assistance. Establishes, in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), an Office of Economic Opportunities to carry out such programs. Prescribes requirements for training and employment programs, conditioning the use of funds by recipient, contractor, and subcontractor on priority to low- and very low-income persons for training and employment opportunities generated by such funds. Specifies among low- and very low-income persons recipients of federal rental assistance, including public housing residents, residents of other federally assisted subsidized properties, and participants in the Section 8 rental housing assistance program. Sets priorities in contracting under such programs for: (1) qualified businesses that are majority owned and controlled by low- and very-low income persons residing in the service area, metropolitan area, or non-metropolitan county where the assistance is being expended; (2) qualified businesses that provide significant training and job opportunities to low- and very low-income persons who reside in such area or county; (3) qualified businesses or to disadvantaged businesses located in distressed communities that provide economic opportunities to low-income residents of such area or county; (4) small and disadvantaged qualified businesses; and (5) other qualified businesses located in such area or county."
