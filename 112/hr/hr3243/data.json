    "text": "Common Sense Deficit Reduction Act of 2011 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to eliminate: (1) health care entitlements for certain individuals who are under age 65, not entitled to or enrolled for benefits under SSA title XVIII (Medicare), and whose income does not exceed 133% of the poverty line; (2) the state option to cover individuals whose income exceeds 133% of the poverty line; (3) the increased federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for medical assistance for newly eligible mandatory individuals; and (4) coverage of former foster care children under age 26. Eliminates requirements that Medicaid benchmark benefits: (1) provide minimum essential coverage, and (2) ensure parity in the financial requirements and treatment limitations in medical and surgical benefits, on the one hand, and mental health or substance use disorder benefits, on the other. Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to eliminate: (1) the extension of the Medicaid premium assistance subsidy to all individuals, regardless of age; and (2) the prohibition against any state requirement, as a condition of Medicaid eligibility, that an individual (or the individual's parent) apply for enrollment in qualified employer-sponsored coverage. Amends SSA titles XIX and XXI (Children's Health Insurance Program) (CHIP) to eliminate the modified adjusted gross income standard for determining Medicaid and CHIP eligibility. Amends SSA title XXI to: (1) eliminate the increased FMAP for CHIP; (2) reduce CHIP appropriations for FY2013 and eliminate them for FY2014-FY2015; (3) repeal the requirement that a state assure exchange coverage for targeted low-income children unable to be provided child health assistance as a result of funding shortfalls; (4) terminate after FY2013 (instead of the current extension through FY2015) the period during which the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) must make grants to improve CHIP outreach and enrollment; and (5) reduce the amount of money for awarding such grants. Reduces the amount of the one-time appropriations to CHIP under the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA). Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the tax credit for premium assistance for coverage under a qualified health plan. Amends PPACA, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Public Health Service Act, and SSA title XIX to repeal mandatory reductions in the maximum limits for out-of-pocket expenses (cost-sharing subsidies) for individuals enrolled in qualified health plans whose incomes are between 100% and 400% of the poverty line. Amends PPACA to require a state's American Health Benefit Exchange to certify that, for purposes of the individual responsibility penalty under the Internal Revenue Code, an individual is exempt from the individual requirement to purchase qualified health care insurance (mandate) or from the penalty imposed by such section because the individual would have qualified for premium assistance under the Internal Revenue Code, medical assistance under Medicaid, child health assistance under CHIP, or reduced costing sharing, but for the enactment of this Act. Repeals the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports program (CLASS Act) under the Public Health Service Act."
