Requires such trust to file with the bankruptcy court quarterly reports, available on the public docket, which describe each demand the trust has received from a claimant and the basis for any payment made to that claimant (excluding any confidential medical record or the claimant's full Social Security number). Requires such reports, upon written request and subject to payment (demanded at the option of the trust) for reasonable costs, to provide any information related to payment from, and demands for payment from, the trust to any party to any action in law or equity if the subject concerns liability for asbestos exposure."
