  <summary>1/19/2011--Introduced.
Military Environmental Responsibility Act - Requires the Department of Defense (DOD) and defense-related agencies (the Department of Energy [DOE], the Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC], the Office of Naval Nuclear Reactors, and any others as designated by the President) to fully comply with designated federal and state environmental laws, including those related to public health and safety, to the same extent as any other entities subject to such laws. Waives any immunity of the United States with respect to such laws as applied to DOD and any defense-related agency. Provides for administrative enforcement actions. Requires the Secretary of Defense, for each weapon system for which congressional budget justification is required, to ensure that all development and procurement decisions comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Repeals prohibitions: (1) on the use of certain military appropriation accounts for the payment of fines and penalties for environmental noncompliance; and (2) forbidding the use of defense funds to conduct treatment, storage, or disposal activities at sites designated under the Formerly Utilized Site Remedial Action Program.</summary>
