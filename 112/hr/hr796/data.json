Excludes Social Security trust fund receipts and disbursements totals from official Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) budget pronouncements. Makes proceeds to the Social Security trust funds from Social Security taxes available solely for OASDI purposes. Prohibits their availability for the establishment or funding of private accounts."
