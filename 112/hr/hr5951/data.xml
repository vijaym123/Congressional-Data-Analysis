  <summary>6/15/2012--Introduced.
Redefines "Member of Congress" under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) with respect to the exclusion from the meaning of "Member" as any Member of the House of Representatives, including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to Congress, who opts out of FERS, but only if he or she served as a Member before the enactment of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2004. Repeals the requirement of service before enactment of such Act. (Thus, allows Members to opt out of FERS benefits regardless of when they have been elected.)</summary>
