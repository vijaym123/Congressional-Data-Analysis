Fire Police Fairness Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include a fire police officer as a public safety officer for purposes of death benefits provisions. Defines a "fire police officer" as an individual who: (1) is serving in accordance with state or local law as a member of a legally organized public safety agency but is not a law enforcement officer, a firefighter, a chaplain, or a member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew; and (2) provides scene security or directs traffic in response to any fire, rescue, or police emergency or at a planned special event.</summary>
