Extends the coverage of the Act to risk retention groups offering commercial property insurance. Applies to commercial property insurance the exemption of purchasing groups from state law. Revises procedures for: (1) submitting financial documents to state insurance commissioners, and (2) mandatory disclosures. Imposes a fiduciary duty upon the board of directors of a risk retention group to operate in the best interests of the group. Redesignates the Act as the Risk Retention Act."
