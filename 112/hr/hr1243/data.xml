  <summary>3/29/2011--Introduced.
Green Taxis Act of 2011 - Allows states or political subdivisions to prescribe requirements for fuel economy for taxicabs and other automobiles if such requirements are at least as stringent as federal requirements and if such vehicles: (1) are automobiles that are capable of transporting not more than 10 individuals, including the driver; (2) are commercially available or are designed and manufactured pursuant to a contract with such state or subdivision; (3) are operated for hire pursuant to a license, permit, or other authorization issued by such state or subdivision; (4) provide local transportation for a fare determined on the basis of the time or distance traveled; and (5) do not exclusively provide transportation to and from airports. Amends the Clean Air Act to allow states or political subdivisions to adopt and enforce standards for the control of emissions from new motor vehicles that are taxicabs and other vehicles if such standards will be at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable federal standards and if such vehicles meet the other criteria specified above.</summary>
