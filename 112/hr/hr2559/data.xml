  <summary>7/15/2011--Introduced.
Helping Homeless Heroes Act of 2011 - Allows grants made by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) for homeless veterans' comprehensive services programs (outreach, rehabilitation, vocational counseling, and transitional housing assistance) to be used for the construction of new facilities. Prohibits the Secretary from denying applications for such grants solely on the basis that the grant entity proposes to use funding from other private or public sources, as long as such entity demonstrates that a private nonprofit organization will provide project oversight and site control. Revises eligibility: (1) under the grant program for entities serving homeless veterans with special needs, and (2) for treatment and rehabilitation of homeless veterans who are not seriously mentally ill. Includes all individuals caring for minor dependents (current law applies only to women caring for minor dependents) within the definition of "homeless veterans with special needs." Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress a comprehensive plan to end homelessness among veterans. Requires the plan to consider circumstances and requirements unique to veterans located in rural areas. Extends provisions concerning: (1) homeless veterans' health care to December 31, 2012; (2) centers for provision of comprehensive services and property transfers for housing assistance to December 31, 2014; and (3) the Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans to December 30, 2013.</summary>
