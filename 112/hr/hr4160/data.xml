  <summary>3/7/2012--Introduced.
State Health Flexibility Act of 2012 - Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to replace the Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program with a program of block grants to states for health care services to indigent individuals. Requires states receiving such block grants to pay for health-care-related items and services provided to a citizen, legal resident, or an alien not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law, if: (1) such health-care-related items and services are necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition; (2) the individual meets all necessary eligibility requirements for health-care-related items and services under the block grant program except for any immigration status requirement; and (3) such items and services are not related to an organ transplant procedure. Repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Health Care and Educational Reconciliation Act of 2010, SSA title XIX (Medicaid), and SSA title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program) (CHIP).</summary>
