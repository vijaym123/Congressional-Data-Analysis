    "text": "Nuclear Power Licensing Reform Act of 2011 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require, for a commercial license for an atomic power production or utilization facility, that: (1) the facility does not pose an unreasonable threat to persons or the environment because of safety or security vulnerabilities (including vulnerability to terrorist attacks), and (2) there exist adequate evacuation plans for emergency events which have been approved by the relevant federal agencies and states within 50 miles of the facility. Conditions renewal of any such license on the same criteria and requirements applicable for an original application for initial construction. Instructs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to ensure that any changes in the size or distribution of the surrounding population, or seismic or other scientific data not available at the time of original licensing, have not resulted in the facility's being located at a site at which a new facility would not be allowed to be built."
