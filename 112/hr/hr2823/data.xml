National Jazz Preservation and Education Act of 2011 - Establishes a National Jazz Preservation Program, to be carried out by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution through the National Museum of American History and in collaboration with other Smithsonian museums, to preserve knowledge and promote education about jazz. Requires the Secretary to: (1) record audio and video interviews with leading jazz artists; (2) acquire, preserve, and interpret jazz artifacts; (3) continue to recognize Jazz Appreciation Month; and (4) establish collaborative agreements with specified entities for the sharing of such artifacts. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to allow certain funds to be made available under the Act for programs to promote jazz education, which may include: (1) a Jazz Artists in the Schools program; (2) a program for the development of lesson plans and other educational materials about jazz, the distribution of such materials, and teacher training on jazz education; and (3) an Ambassadors of Jazz program.</summary>
