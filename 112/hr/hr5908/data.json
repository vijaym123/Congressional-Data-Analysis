Allows an exemption from such requirement: (1) if a department or agency head determines that satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity of such paper or paper products cannot be procured as and when needed at U.S. market prices; (2) for procurements outside the United States in support of combat or contingency operations or by vessels in foreign waters; and (3) for items purchased for resale in commissaries, exchanges, or certain facilities operated by the Department of Defense (DOD)."
