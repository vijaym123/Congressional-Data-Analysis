Directs the Secretary of each military department to ensure that each member of the Armed Forces under their jurisdiction receives an audiometric test at the 8000 Hz frequency (or an equivalent test) to evaluate the hearing of such member during the 90-day period before the member is discharged, separated, or retired."
