  <summary>8/2/2012--Introduced.
Reducing Barriers to Veterans' Benefits Act - Presumes a service connection, for veterans' benefits purposes, for diagnosed hearing loss, tinnitus, or both, for veterans who, during active military service: (1) were assigned to a military occupational specialty in which the veterans were likely to be exposed to a level of acoustic trauma sufficient to result in permanent hearing loss, tinnitus, or both; or (2) served in combat against a hostile force during a period of hostilities. Directs the Secretary of each military department to ensure that each member of the Armed Forces under their jurisdiction receives an audiometric test at the 8000 Hz frequency (or an equivalent test) to evaluate the hearing of such member during the 90-day period before the member is discharged, separated, or retired.</summary>
