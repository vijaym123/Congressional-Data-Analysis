Requires a state to certify that such supplemental food and nutrition assistance will include specified work and benefits use requirements. Authorizes states to: (1) set aside funds to be used during periods of unexpectedly high unemployment or program enrollment, and (2) use up to 30% of funds for other welfare-related programs. Prohibits supplemental food and nutrition assistance from being provided to aliens who are not residing legally in the United States. Requires annual state audits. Sets forth federal program authorities and nondiscrimination provisions. Repeals the: (1) the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program); (2) the emergency food assistance program; (3) community food projects; (4) the commodity supplemental food program; (5) the senior farmers' market nutrition program; and (6) the fresh fruit and vegetable program.</summary>
