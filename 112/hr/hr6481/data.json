Favors loan guarantee applicants that demonstrate a substantial or disproportionate need (as compared with other applicants) for food service infrastructure or durable equipment. Prohibits a loan guarantee from covering more than 90% of a loan's principal. Directs the Secretary to award competitive matching grants to experienced third-party training institutions to provide school food service personnel with the training and technical assistance they need to meet updated school lunch program nutrition standards."
