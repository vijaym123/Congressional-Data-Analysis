  <summary>3/17/2011--Introduced.
Accountability in Immigrant Repatriation Act of 2011 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Secretary of State, upon notice by the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) that a foreign government denies or unreasonably delays accepting the return of an alien who is a citizen, subject, national, or resident of that country, to order consular officers in that foreign country to stop granting immigrant visas or nonimmigrant visas to citizens, subjects, nationals, and residents of that country until the country has accepted the alien. (Under current law the Attorney General provides such notice to the Secretary of State.) Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, upon a determination that a foreign government denies or unreasonably delays accepting an alien who is a citizen, subject, national, or resident of that country after the alien has been ordered removed, to deny admission to any citizen, subject, national, or resident of such country who is seeking or has received a diplomatic nonimmigrant visa.</summary>
