  <summary>12/1/2011--Introduced.
National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011 - Amends the federal criminal code to authorize a person who is carrying a valid, government-issued identification document containing that person's photograph and a valid permit to carry a concealed firearm in one state, and who is not prohibited from possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm under federal law, to possess or carry a concealed handgun (other than a machine gun or destructive device) in another state in accordance with the restrictions of that state. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct an audit of: (1) state laws and regulations that authorize the issuance of a concealed firearm permit or license to a nonresident, including a description of the permitting or licensing requirements; (2) the number of such valid permits or licenses issued or denied (and the basis for such denials) to nonresidents by each state; and (3) the effectiveness of such state laws and regulations in protecting the public safety.</summary>
