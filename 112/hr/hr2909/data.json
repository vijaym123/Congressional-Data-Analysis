Withdraws the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations) from PRC products. Requires the President to: (1) negotiate a balanced trade relationship between the United States and the PRC within four years after enactment of this Act; and (2) submit trade implementing legislation to Congress, which shall be considered on an expedited basis."
