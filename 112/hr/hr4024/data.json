Exempts an application from such prohibition if the natural gas would be exported solely to meet certain requirements of: (1) the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (regarding presidential foreign exchange authorities), (2) Trading with the Enemy Act (regarding transactions in foreign exchange of gold or silver, property transfers, and vested interests), or (3) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (regarding the International Energy Program)."
