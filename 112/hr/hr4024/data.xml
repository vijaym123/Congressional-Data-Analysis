North America Natural Gas Security and Consumer Protection Act - Prohibits the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from approving, before January 1, 2025, any application under the Natural Gas Act: (1) for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of an liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal for activities related to exporting natural gas from the United States to a foreign country; or (2) to amend an existing FERC authorization in order to modify an existing authorized facility to an LNG terminal that will be used for such activities. Exempts an application from such prohibition if the natural gas would be exported solely to meet certain requirements of: (1) the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (regarding presidential foreign exchange authorities), (2) Trading with the Enemy Act (regarding transactions in foreign exchange of gold or silver, property transfers, and vested interests), or (3) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (regarding the International Energy Program).</summary>
