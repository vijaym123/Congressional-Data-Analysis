Directs the Secretary to prescribe standards for the maximum number of hours that a commercial motor vehicle operator transporting property in interstate commerce may be reasonably detained, if not compensated for the time detained, by a shipper or receiver before the loading or unloading of the vehicle.

Prescribes penalties for violation of this prohibition.</summary>
