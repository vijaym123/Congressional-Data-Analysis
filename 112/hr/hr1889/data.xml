  <summary>5/12/2011--Introduced.
Gas Tax Holiday Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to suspend the excise tax on highway motor fuels for 45 days beginning 7 days after the enactment of this Act. Expresses the sense of Congress that consumers should immediately receive the benefit from the suspension of such tax&#160;(i.e., 18.4 cents per gallon tax reduction). Denies or limits for any company that is not a small, independent oil and gas company certain tax benefits for one year, including: (1) amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures; (2) the tax credits for producing oil and gas from marginal wells and for enhanced oil recovery costs; (3) the tax deductions for intangible drilling and development costs for oil and gas wells and for tertiary injectant expenses; (4) the percentage depletion allowance; (5) the exemption from limits on the deductibility of passive activity losses; and (6) the tax deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities relating to oil, natural gas, or any primary product thereof. Prohibits the use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) accounting method by major integrated oil companies. Limits or denies the foreign tax credit and tax deferrals for amounts paid or accrued by a dual capacity taxpayer to a foreign country or U.S. possession for any period with respect to combined foreign oil and gas income. Defines "dual capacity taxpayer" as a person who is subject to a levy of a foreign country or U.S. possession and receives (or will receive) directly or indirectly a specific economic benefit from such county or possession. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to extend the one-year denial of tax benefits to any company that is not a small, independent oil and gas company if revenues raised during that period are&#160;insufficient to cover the cost of suspending the excise taxes on higway motor fuels.</summary>
