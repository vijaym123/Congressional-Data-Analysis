    "text": "Oversight and Accountability in Wartime Contracting Act of 2012 - Directs the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to: (1) limit contracts entered into in connection with an overseas contingency operation (OCO) to three years for competitively bid contracts and one year for non-competitively bid contracts and competitively bid contracts for which only one offer was received; (2) limit any contract for services in connection with an OCO to a single tier of subcontractors; and (3) require contractors, subcontractors, and related entities to consent to personal jurisdiction in covered civil actions (e.g., civil actions alleging rape or serious bodily injury, wrongful death, or breach of contract) involving overseas contracts valued at not less than $1 million. Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to develop a strategy for ensuring that timely, accurate, and complete information on contractor performance is included in past performance databases used by executive agencies for making source selection decisions. Requires the Secretaries of Defense (DOD) and State, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to certify to specified congressional committees that a country for which funds have been appropriated for a capital project with an estimated value in excess of $1 million has the capability (in both financial and human resources) to effectively maintain and utilize the project. Establishes offices to oversee contingency contracting in DOD, the Department of State, and USAID. Requires the Inspectors General of DOD, the Department of State, and USAID to review and evaluate noncompetitive contracts and one-offer contracts and to submit annual reports on such contracts to specified committees of Congress. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) exclude from the gross income of DOD civilian employees compensation for active service in a combat zone, and (2) allow such employees a reduced estate tax rate and an exemption from the excise tax on local and toll telephone service. Directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with certain federal officials, to submit to specified congressional committees a report on the success of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. Extends through FY2013 the annual reporting requirement of the Secretary of Defense on the plan for sustaining Afghanistan security forces."
