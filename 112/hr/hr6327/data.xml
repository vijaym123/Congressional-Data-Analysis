PCIP Improvement Act of 2012 - Amends the Public Health Service Act with respect to immediate access to insurance under the Preexisting Condition Insurance Program (PCIP) for uninsured individuals with a preexisting condition. Revises the eligibility requirement for the temporary high risk health insurance pool under the PCIP that individuals be without creditable coverage for six months before applying for coverage through the high risk pool. Adds the condition that an individual has not had creditable coverage terminated in order to become eligible through such pool. Defines &#8220;creditable coverage&#8221; to exclude any coverage (commonly referred to as mini-med coverage) that limits the annual benefits payable to an amount less than $250,000.</summary>
