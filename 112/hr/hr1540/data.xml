  <summary>12/31/2011--Public Law.
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 - Division A: Department of Defense Authorizations - Title I: Procurement - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - (Sec. 101) Authorizes appropriations for FY2012 for the Department of Defense (DOD) for procurement for the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, Air Force, and defense-wide activities, in amounts specified in the funding table in Division D of this Act. Subtitle B: Army Programs - (Sec. 111) Prohibits the Secretary of the Army from procuring more than 100 Stryker combat vehicles. Allows such Secretary to waive such limitation after a specified certification to the congressional defense and appropriations committees, including that there are validated Army needs requiring the waiver. (Sec. 112) Directs the Secretary of the Army, upon determining to retire a C-23 aircraft for which there has been no agreed-upon transfer, to first offer it to the chief executive officer of the state in which the aircraft is based. Requires the state to assume all costs of the aircraft following its transfer. Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to study, and report to the defense and appropriations committees on, the number of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft required to support Air Force missions at low, medium, moderate, high, and very-high levels of operational risk. Requires the Comptroller General (CG) to conduct a sufficiency review of such study, and report review results to such committees. (Sec. 113) Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to enter into one or more multiyear contracts, beginning with the FY2012 program year, for the procurement of airframes for UH-60M/HH-60M and MH-60R/S helicopters. Subtitle C: Navy Programs - (Sec. 121) Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to enter into one or more multiyear contracts, beginning with the FY2012 program year, for the procurement of mission avionics and common cockpits for MH-60R/S helicopters. (Sec. 122) Directs the Secretary of Defense (Secretary), in budget materials submitted to the President in connection with the budget for FY2013 and thereafter, to ensure that a separate, dedicated procurement line item is designated for each surface warfare, mine countermeasures, and anti-submarine warfare littoral combat ship (LCS) module. (Sec. 123) Requires the Secretary of the Navy to: (1) conduct a life-cycle cost-benefit analysis comparing alternative maintenance and sustainability plans for the LCS program, and (2) report analysis results to the defense and appropriations committees. (Sec. 124) Amends the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Warner Act) to allow the Secretary of the Navy to fund construction of the Ford-class aircraft carriers designated CVN-79 and CVN-80 over a five-year period. Subtitle D: Air Force Programs - (Sec. 131) Directs the Secretary of the Air Force, as of October 1, 2011, to maintain a total inventory of strategic airlift aircraft of not less than 301. (Sec. 132) Prohibits this Act's funds from being obligated or expended to retire any B-1 bomber aircraft before the date on which the Secretary of the Air Force submits to the defense and appropriations committee a plan for retiring such aircraft. Authorizes such Secretary, after such date, to retire more than six of such aircraft through FY2016. (Sec. 133) Prohibits the Secretary of the Air Force from taking any action to prevent maintaining the U-2 aircraft fleet in its current configuration and capability beyond FY2016 until: (1) the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (Under Secretary) certifies to the defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees that the operating and sustainment costs for the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle are less than comparable costs for the U-2 on a flight-hour basis; and (2) the Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) certifies to such committees that the capability to be fielded before or at the same time of U-2 aircraft retirement would result in equal or greater capability available to the commanders of the combatant commands. (Sec. 134) Authorizes the use of specified FY2011 B-2 bomber aircraft funds for: (1) research, development, test, and evaluation on a conventional mixed load capability for such aircraft, and (2) supporting alternative options for the extremely high frequency terminal Increment 1 program of record. Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to submit to the defense and appropriations committees a plan to provide an extremely high frequency terminal for secure protected communications for the B-2 and other aircraft. (Sec. 136) Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to procure two advanced extremely high frequency satellites through a fixed-price contract. Allows such Secretary to use incremental funding for up to six fiscal years in connection with the procurement. Makes such procurement subject to the availability of appropriations. Prohibits the total procurement amount, after certain exclusions, from exceeding $3.1 billion. Allows such Secretary to adjust such limitation by specified amounts, including increases or decreases after FY2011 attributable to inflation or to compliance with changes in federal, state, and local laws. Requires such Secretary to notify the defense and appropriations committees of any such adjustment.
