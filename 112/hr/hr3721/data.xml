Servicemember Assistance for Lawful Understanding, Treatment, and Education Act or the SALUTE Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Attorney General to make grants for veterans' treatment courts and programs for continuing judicial supervision over offenders who are veterans. Requires such grants to be used for: (1) developing, implementing, or enhancing veterans' treatment courts or expanding operational mental health or drug courts to serve veterans to ensure that such courts effectively integrate substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment, sanctions and incentives, and transitional services in a judicially supervised court setting with jurisdiction over offenders that have served in the U.S. military; and (2) programs that involve continuing judicial supervision over offenders with substance abuse or mental health problems who have served in the U.S. military and the integrated administration of other sanctions and services, which shall include substance abuse and mental health treatment for each participant and diversion, probation, or other supervised release involving the possibility of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration based on noncompliance with program requirements or failure to show satisfactory progress. Requires an evaluation report submited by a state, Indian tribal government, or local government that receives funds under such Act to include data on and an evaluation of the effectiveness of veterans' treatment courts and programs.</summary>
