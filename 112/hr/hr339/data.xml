End the Lame Duck Act - Considers the House of Representatives to be adjourned sine die if it stands adjourned on the date of the regularly scheduled general election for federal office during a Congress (beginning with the 112th Congress) pursuant to a concurrent resolution providing for the adjournment of the House. Authorizes the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate, or their respective designees, acting jointly and with the written agreement of the Minority Leaders of both chambers, to notify the Members of the House and Senate to reassemble if each determines that it is in the interest of the United States to do so. Provides for automatic continuing appropriations if a regular appropriation bill for a fiscal year does not become law before the date of the regularly scheduled general election for federal office held during such fiscal year.</summary>
