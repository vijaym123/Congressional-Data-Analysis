  <summary>1/20/2011--Introduced.
End the Stimulus Advertisement Act - Prohibits the use of funds appropriated or otherwise made available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) for physical signage indicating that a project is funded by such Act. States that under appropriations Acts providing funds for each of FY2012 and FY2013, the total amount available for obligation for administrative expenses of an affected agency shall be the amount that would otherwise be available, reduced by 50% of the amount reported to have been expended before the enactment of this Act for such signage. Requires the head of each affected agency to report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a determination of such amount. Requires OMB to determine the allocation of such reduction among the accounts, and programs, projects, and activities within the accounts, of each affected agency. Requires the head of each affected agency to deposit such reduction amount in the general fund of the Treasury for purposes of deficit reduction.</summary>
