  <summary>2/16/2012--Introduced.
Automatic IRA Act of 2012 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) require certain employers who do not maintain qualifying retirement plans or arrangements to make available to their eligible employees a payroll deposit individual retirement account (IRA) arrangement (automatic IRA arrangement) which grants such employees the right to opt-out of participation; (2) require the Secretary of the Treasury to provide employers with a model notice for notifying employees of their opportunity to participate in such an arrangement and to provide participants with an annual statement setting forth arrangement payments, earnings, value, and other specified information; (3) impose a penalty on employers who fail to provide eligible employees access to such an arrangement; (4) establish an Automatic IRA Advisory Group to make recommendations regarding investment options; and (5) allow employers who do not have more than 100 employees a tax credit for costs associated with establishing an automatic IRA arrangement. Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Labor to jointly conduct feasibility studies on: (1) extending spousal consent requirements to automatic IRA arrangements; (2) promoting the use of low-cost lifetime income arrangements, (3) automatically transferring amounts saved by employees in retirement bonds into alternative, private sector, diversified investments when employees' automatic IRA balances reach a certain dollar level; (4) using investment data to notify individuals with multiple small balance retirement accounts of consolidation options; and (5) using investment arrangements associated with automatic IRAs to assist in addressing the problem of abandoned accounts.</summary>
