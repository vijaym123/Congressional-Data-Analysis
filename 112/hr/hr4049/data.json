Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Labor to jointly conduct feasibility studies on: (1) extending spousal consent requirements to automatic IRA arrangements; (2) promoting the use of low-cost lifetime income arrangements, (3) automatically transferring amounts saved by employees in retirement bonds into alternative, private sector, diversified investments when employees' automatic IRA balances reach a certain dollar level; (4) using investment data to notify individuals with multiple small balance retirement accounts of consolidation options; and (5) using investment arrangements associated with automatic IRAs to assist in addressing the problem of abandoned accounts."
