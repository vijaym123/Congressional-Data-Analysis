  <summary>3/1/2011--Introduced.
Kelsey Smith Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require telecommunication carriers to provide, at the request of a law enforcement agency, call location information of users of a commercial mobile service or an IP-enabled voice service (e.g., cell phones) to such agencies and other public safety agencies to respond to emergency situations. Directs the Attorney General (DOJ), under the Byrne Law Enforcement Grant Program, to: (1) provide education and training to state and local law enforcement agencies and officials to collect and use call location information in emergency situations, and (2) develop and disseminate procedures to ensure that such agencies and officials have the necessary contact information to request and obtain call location information.</summary>
