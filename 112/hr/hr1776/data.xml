  <summary>5/5/2011--Introduced.
Older Driver and Pedestrian Safety and Roadway Enhancement Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to implement a roadway safety enhancement program for older drivers and pedestrians to: (1) improve roadway safety infrastructure in states that is consistent with recommendations of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in the "Highway Design Handbook for Older Drivers and Pedestrians," and (2) achieve significant reductions in roadway fatalities and serious injuries among drivers and pedestrians 65 years old or older on all public roads. Sets forth project eligibility requirements and project identification and selection priorities. Requires the Secretary to finalize revision of the Handbook for publication. Amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to repeal its program for roadway safety improvements for older drivers and pedestrians. Requires the Secretary to: (1) appoint a Special Assistant for Older Driver and Pedestrian Safety within the Office of the Secretary; and (2) establish national goals for increasing driver, passenger, and pedestrian safety for persons 65 years old or older. Requires the Secretary to revise the manual on uniform traffic control devices to include a standard for a minimum level of retroreflectivity for pavement markings on all public roads.</summary>
