Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to permit states to collect tolls on highways, bridges, or tunnels for reconstructing and rehabilitating IS highway corridors only if the state has solicited, received, and published on its website public comments approving or disapproving the toll facility, including comments on its economic and environmental impact. Directs the Secretary, upon a state's application for a facility, to meet monthly with local transportation representatives and consumer advocacy groups to discuss their views and recommendations for any modifications to a state's plan for a proposed toll facility. Requires a state to hold at least one public meeting to review the specifics of its final facility management plan and solicit public comment. Requires the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to: (1) publish on its website all comments and suggestions received by the state regarding the proposed toll facility, and (2) consider them before making a final determination on a state's application."
