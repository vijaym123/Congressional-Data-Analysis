Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) revise income tax rates for individual taxpayers whose taxable income is at or below the $400,000 threshold amount ($450,000 for married couples filing a joint return) and increase the rate to 39.6% for taxpayers whose taxable income exceeds the threshold, (2) set the threshold for the phaseout of personal tax exemptions and itemized deductions at $250,000 for individual taxpayers ($300,000 for married couples filing a joint return), and (3) increase the top marginal estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. (Sec. 102) Makes permanent for individual taxpayers whose taxable income is at or below a $400,000 threshold ($450,000 for married couples filing a joint return) provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 that reduce tax rates for capital gain and dividend income. Increases the capital gains tax rate from 15% to 20% for taxpayers whose taxable income exceeds the $400,000 threshold amount. (Sec. 103) Extends through 2017: (1) the American Opportunity tax credit, (2) the child tax credit, and (3) the increased earned income tax credit. Makes permanent the disregard of tax refunds for determining eligibility for benefits or assistance under any federal program or state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds. (Sec. 104) Establishes a permanent $78,750 exemption from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for married taxpayers filing a joint tax return ($50,600 for individual taxpayers). Provides for an annual inflation adjustment to such exemption amounts for calendar years after 2012. Title II: Individual Tax Extenders - (Sec. 201) Extends through 2013 expiring tax provisions relating to individual taxpayers, including: the tax deduction for certain expenses of elementary and secondary school teachers; the exclusion from gross income of amounts attributable to the discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness; the equalization of the exclusion from gross income of employer-provided commuter transit and parking benefits; the tax deduction for mortgage insurance premiums; the election to deduct state and local general sales taxes in lieu of state and local income taxes; the tax deduction for contributions of capital gain real property made for conservation purposes; the tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses; and the exemption from tax of distributions from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) made for charitable purposes. (Sec. 209) Makes permanent the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose tax returns and other information to federal and state prison officials for inmates who may have filed or facilitated the filing of false or fraudulent tax returns. Allows disclosures of such information to contractors responsible for the operation of a federal or state prison and to the legal representatives of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a state agency, a contractor charged with the responsibility for administration of prisons, or the incarcerated individual accused of filing the false or fraudulent return. Title III: Business Tax Extenders - (Sec. 301) Extends through 2013 expiring tax provisions relating to business taxpayers, including: the tax credit for increasing research activities; the 9% low-income housing tax credit rate for newly constructed non-federally subsidized buildings; the exemption of the basic military housing allowance from the income test for programs financed by tax-exempt housing bonds; the Indian employment tax credit; the new markets tax credit; the tax credit for qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures; the tax credit for mine rescue team training expenses; the tax credit for differential wage payments to employees who are active duty members of the Uniformed Services; the work opportunity tax credit; the authority for issuing qualified zone academy bonds; accelerated depreciation for qualified leasehold, restaurant, and retail improvements, for motorsports entertainment complexes, and for business property on Indian reservations; the deduction for contributions of food inventory by taxpayers other than C corporations; increased expensing allowances for depreciable business property; the election to expense advanced mine safety equipment and expensing of film and television production expenses; the deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities in Puerto Rico; tax rules relating to payments between related foreign corporations; rules for the tax treatment of certain dividends of regulated investment companies (RICs); the subpart F income exemption for income derived in the active conduct of a banking, finance, or insurance business; the 100% exclusion from gross income of gain from the sale or exchange of certain small business stock; the rule for adjusting stock of an S corporation making charitable contributions of property; the reduction of the recognition period for the built-in gains of S corporations; tax incentives for investment in empowerment zones; the authority for issuing New York Liberty Zone bonds; the increased limitation for payments of excise taxes on distilled spirits into the treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; the tax credit for investment in American Samoan economic development activities; and the additional depreciation allowance (bonus depreciation) for business assets and the election to accelerate the AMT in lieu of bonus depreciation.

(Sec. 404) Extends through 2013 the cellulosic biofuel producer tax credit. Modifies the definition of "cellulosic biofuel" for purposes of such credit to mean any liquid fuel which is derived by, or from, qualified feedstocks. Defines "qualified feedstocks" as any lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter that is available on a renewable or recurring basis and any cultivated algae, cyanobacteria, or lemna.
