  <summary>3/28/2012--Introduced.
Student Loan Grace Period Extension Act - Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend the grace period before payment must begin on Direct Stafford Loans from 6 months to 12 months after borrowers cease to carry at least one-half the normal full-time academic workload. Extends the federal interest subsidy on Direct Stafford Loans to all of the interest accrued on such loans before the loan repayment period begins. (Currently, the subsidy applies to all of the interest accrued before a borrower ceases to carry at least one-half the normal full-time academic workload.)</summary>
