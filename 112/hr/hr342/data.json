Requires the Secretary to make specified adjustments to the Medicare DSH payment system, including an additional payment to hospitals based on the amount of uncompensated care they have provided, if there is a significant decrease in the national rate of uninsurance as a result of corrected PPACA. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA), as amended by PPACA and HCERA, to eliminate certain current requirements for adjustments to Medicare DSH payments. Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid), as amended by PPACA and HCERA, to postpone specified Medicaid DSH reductions scheduled for FY2014-FY2020 until FY2018-FY2024."
