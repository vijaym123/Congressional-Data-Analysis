Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act for the construction of a covered levee from being conditioned on its dismantlement, except as provided for in a status certificate. Requires the Chief of Engineers to provide a status certificate for each levee constructed with federal assistance provided under that Act. Defines \"covered levee\" to mean a levee or similar structure constructed: (1) in response to a major disaster or emergency; and (2) in an area in which at least one other such structure was constructed in response to such a disaster or emergency, and subsequently dismantled, during the 10-year period preceding the date on which the President declares the major disaster or emergency. Defines \"status certificate\" to mean a written determination by the Chief of Engineers that a levee or similar structure: (1) is constructed in a manner that satisfies standards applicable to a permanent levee or similar structure, is not constructed in a manner that satisfies such standards but there is an adequate plan for improvements to ensure that such standards will be satisfied, or is not constructed in a manner that satisfies such standards and there is no adequate plan for improvements; and (2) may safely remain in place subject to specified conditions and for a specified period."
