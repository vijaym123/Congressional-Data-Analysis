  <summary>12/17/2012--Reported to House amended, Part I.
North American Energy Access Act - (Sec. 2) Prohibits construction, operation, or maintenance of the oil pipeline and related facilities described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Keystone XL Pipeline Project issued by the Department of State on August 26, 2011, unless it is in compliance with the terms of a permit prescribed under this Act (including any modified version of that pipeline and related facilities). (Sec. 3) Instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to issue a permit without additional conditions within 30 days after receipt of an application for the pipeline and related facilities, to be implemented in accordance with such Final EIS. States that FERC shall not be required to prepare a specified Record of Decision under of the Code of Federal Regulations with respect to issuance of such permit. Deems a permit to have been issued if FERC has not acted upon a permit application within 30 days after its receipt. Requires a permit applicant to first obtain FERC approval before making any substantial modifications to either the pipeline route or any other term of the Final EIS. Directs FERC to expedite consideration of any such proposal to modify. Directs FERC, within 30 days after enactment of this Act, to: (1) enter into a memorandum of understanding with the state of Nebraska for review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 of any modification to the proposed pipeline route in Nebraska, and (2) complete consideration and to approve such modification within 30 days after receiving the governor's approval. Deems approval to have been issued if FERC has not acted within 30 days after receiving an application to approve a modification. Authorizes the permit holder, while modification of the proposed pipeline route in Nebraska is under consideration, to commence or continue construction of any portion of the pipeline and related facilities that are not located within Nebraska. (Sec. 4) Declares that no presidential permit shall be required for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the pipeline and related facilities. Declares that nothing in this Act shall affect application to the pipeline and related facilities of: (1) federal pipeline safety requirements of the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011; and (2) FERC authority to regulate oil pipeline rates and services.</summary>
