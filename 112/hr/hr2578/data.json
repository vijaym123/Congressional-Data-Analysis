Title VI: North Cascades National Park Access - (Sec. 602) Amends the Washington Park Wilderness Act of 1988 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to adjust the boundaries of the North Cascades National Park and the Stephen Mather Wilderness in Washington state in order to provide a corridor of not more than 100-feet in width along which the Stehekin Valley Road may be rebuilt: (1) outside of the floodplain between mileposts 12.9 and 22.8, (2) within one mile of the route for such Road, (3) within the boundaries of the Park, and (4) outside of the boundaries of the Wilderness. Requires that the boundary adjustments be such that equal federally owned acreage amounts are exchanged between the Wilderness and the Park. Requires lands in the newly designated wilderness to include lands along the route of the Stehekin Valley Road that are replaced by the reconstruction. Authorizes the Secretary, if such lands contain fewer acres than the corridor, to designate additional federal lands in the Park as wilderness, but bars such designation from exceeding the acreage amount needed to equalize the exchange. Instructs that these additional lands must be selected from lands that qualify as wilderness. Prohibits anything in this Act from: (1) authorizing the sale or acquisition of any land or interest in land, and (2) being construed as requiring the Secretary to give this project precedence over the construction or repair of other similarly damaged roads in units of the National Park System. Title VII: Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act - Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act - (Sec. 703) Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to authorize the Secretary of the department in which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is operating to issue one-year permits to Washington, Oregon, Idaho, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, and the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission for the lethal taking on the waters of the Columbia River or its tributaries of sea lions that are part of a healthy population that is not listed as an endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 in order to protect endangered and threatened species of salmon and other nonlisted fish species. Authorizes the Secretary to renew such permits. Prohibits such a permit from authorizing the lethal taking of more than 10 sea lions. Limits the cumulative annual taking of sea lions each year under all such permits to 1% of the annual potential biological removal level.

Bars the imposition of any additional restrictions on pedestrian or motorized vehicular access to any part of the Recreation Area for species protection beyond those in the Interim Management Strategy, other than as specifically authorized pursuant to this title. (Sec. 1003) Allows the Secretary if, based on peer-reviewed science and after public comment, it is determined that additional restrictions on access to a part of the Recreation Area are necessary to protect endangered species, to only restrict pedestrian and vehicular access for recreational activities for the shortest possible time and on the smallest possible portions of such area. (Sec. 1004) Prohibits the final rule titled \"Special Regulations, Areas of the National Park System, Cape Hatteras National Seashore-Off-Road Vehicle Management\" from having any force or effect.

Allows the issuance of such permits and leases where the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) respecting lands within National Forests in the 16 contiguous Western states (the Secretary concerned) determines that the initial environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) regarding a grazing allotment, permit, or lease has not been completed. (Sec. 1103) Directs that grazing permits or leases issued by the Secretary of the Interior respecting lands under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior and grazing permits issued by the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) respecting National Forest System lands that expire, are transferred, or are waived after this Act's enactment be renewed or reissued under, as appropriate, the Act, Granger-Thye Act, Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, or California Desert Protection Act of 1994. Continues the terms and conditions (except the termination date) that is contained in such an expired, transferred, or waived permit or lease in effect under a renewed or reissued permit or lease until the Secretary concerned completes the processing of the permit or lease that is the subject of the expired, transferred, or waived permit or lease. (Permits the cancellation, suspension, or modification of such an expired, transferred, or waived permit or lease in accordance with applicable law.) Authorizes the Secretary concerned to renew or reissue such permit or lease that is the subject of the expired, transferred, or waived permit or lease for a 20-year term when the processing has been completed. Allows exclusion of the renewal, reissuance, or transfer of a grazing permit or lease by the Secretary concerned from the NEPA requirement to prepare an environmental analysis if: (1) such decision continues current grazing management of the allotment; (2) monitoring of the allotment has indicated that the current grazing management has met, or has satisfactorily progressed towards meeting, objectives contained in the land use and resource management plan of such allotment; or (3) such decision is consistent with the concerned Department's policy with regard to extraordinary circumstances. Gives Secretary concerned the sole discretion to determine the priority and timing for the completion of each required environmental analysis regarding any grazing allotment, permit, or lease based on its environmental significance and on the funding available for such purpose.
