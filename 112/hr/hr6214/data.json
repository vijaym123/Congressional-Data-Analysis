Prohibits more than 5% of the total number of HHS employees from serving as special consultants or fellowship recipients. Limits, with exceptions determined by the HHS Secretary, the compensation payable to such an individual for a 12-month period to 150% of the annual rate payable under level 1 of the Executive Schedule, prorated for shorter periods. Requires an annual report to Congress concerning the employment of such individuals."
