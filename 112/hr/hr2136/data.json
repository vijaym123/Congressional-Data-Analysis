Sets forth the crimes under federal law that are covered by this Act. Exempts an authorized intelligence activity that is carried out by or on behalf of any element of the intelligence community and conducted in accordance with law. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) assign personnel and resources through task forces to investigate allegations of criminal offenses by federal contractors and employees overseas, and (2) report to Congress annually on the number of prosecutions and actions taken. Grants the Attorney General principal authority for the enforcement of this Act. Provides for an optional venue for offenses under this Act involving federal employees and contractors overseas in the district in which is headquartered the U.S. agency that: (1) employs the offender, or any one of two or more joint offenders; or (2) the offender is accompanying, or that any one of two or more joint offenders is accompanying. Requires the statute of limitations for an offense under this Act to be computed without regard to any time the alleged offender is outside the United States."
