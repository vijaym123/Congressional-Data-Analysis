  <summary>5/18/2012--Introduced.
Housing for Heroes Act - Prohibits grants made by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) under homeless veterans' comprehensive services programs (outreach, rehabilitation, vocational counseling and training, and transitional housing assistance) from exceeding 65% of the estimated cost of the project concerned. Prohibits the Secretary from denying applications for such grants solely on the basis that the grant entity proposes to use funding from other private or public sources, as long as such entity demonstrates that a private nonprofit organization will provide project oversight and site control.</summary>
