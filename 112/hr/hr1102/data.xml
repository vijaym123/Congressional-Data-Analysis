  <summary>3/15/2011--Introduced.
Affordable Gas Price Act - Declares without force or effect all provisions of existing federal law that prohibit spending appropriated funds to conduct oil or natural gas leasing and preleasing activities for any area of the Outer Continental Shelf. Revokes all existing withdrawals by the President under the authority of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to repeal: (1) the withdrawal of public lands within the Coastal Plain from entry or appropriation under federal mining or mineral leasing laws; and (2) the prohibition against the production, leasing, and development of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to shield from judicial review mandatory statements by certain federal officials regarding the environmental impact of federal actions upon the quality of the human environment. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) set forth additional incentives for investment in oil refineries; (2) suspend the tax on highway motor fuels when retail gasoline exceeds a certain benchmark; and (3) increase mileage reimbursement rates. Authorizes the President to extend normal trade relations treatment to the products of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.</summary>
