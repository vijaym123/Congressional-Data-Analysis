    "text": "Fulfilling U.S. Energy Leadership Act or FUEL Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to direct the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to conduct a seismic inventory of oil and natural gas resources for waters of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Atlantic Region, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the Alaska Region. Amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, Division C of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, to repeal the moratorium upon oil and gas leasing in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Deems to be final and in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and all other federal laws the 2012-2017 oil and gas leasing program issued by the Secretary of the Interior on March 31, 2010. Sets forth a scheme for the disposition of bonuses, rents, and royalties received by the United States for OCS oil and gas leases. Establishes: (1) the Institute for Ocean Energy Safety, (2) the Federal Onshore Energy Development Task Force, and (3) the Next Generation Energy and Efficiency Fund. Expresses the sense of Congress that industry should be encouraged to voluntarily disclose and publicize the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require the Secretary of the Interior, as part of the Federal Permit Streamlining Pilot Project, to designate one field office of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in each of specified states to serve as a Renewable Energy Permit Coordination Office. Requires deposit of the federal share of payments from wind or solar development on BLM land in a special BLM Wind and Solar Energy Permit Processing Improvement Fund. Extends funding for the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 through FY2022. Instructs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the BLM, with respect to BLM lands, and the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to National Forest System (NFS) lands, to complete programmatic environmental impact statements to analyze the potential impacts of a program to develop solar, wind, and geothermal energy on such lands. Instructs such Secretary to: (1) arrange with the National Academy of Sciences to study the siting, development, and management of projects for the production of wind, solar, and geothermal energy on all such lands available for energy development. Directs the DOE Secretary to provide technical assistance to designated stakeholders to expedite renewable energy production from certain brownfield sites. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a wind and solar leasing pilot program on BLM and NFS lands. Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to count each gallon of renewable fuel produced from algae in a specified manner. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to: (1) make eligible for loan guarantees specified substitute natural gas production facilities; and (2) extend the authorization for programs of civilian nuclear energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application. Expands nuclear energy research programs to replace the Nuclear Power 2010 Program, the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative, and research in designs for high-temperature reactors capable of producing large-scale quantities of hydrogen with research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs for: (1) advanced reactor designs and nuclear technologies, (2) small modular reactors, (3) steam-side improvements to nuclear power plants, and (4) certain fuel cycle options. Directs the Secretary of Energy to support the integration of activities that target nuclear energy enabling technologies. Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) report to Congress on the quantitative risks associated with the potential of a severe accident arising from the use of civilian nuclear energy technology, (3) arrange with the National Academies to evaluate scientific and technological challenges to the long-term maintenance and safe operation of currently deployed nuclear power reactors, and (3) prepare a database of non-federal user facilities receiving federal funds that may be used for unclassified nuclear energy research. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal the requirement that the prototype nuclear reactor and associated plant for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant project be sited at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho. Requires the plant to be constructed at a location determined by the consortium of appropriate industrial partners through an open and transparent competitive selection process. Instructs the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish a nuclear energy standards committee. Confers responsibility upon DOE for disposal of high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel generated under this Act. Amends the Federal Power Act to: (1) declare U.S. policy regarding the national interstate electricity transmission system, (2) direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to coordinate regional planning for integration of an Interconnection-wide transmission plan, (3 ) authorize FERC to permit construction of a high-priority national transmission project, and (4) designate the Secretary of the Interior as the lead agency for coordinating federal authorizations."
