Requires the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking to\u00a0monitor all\u00a0known cases and activities involving trafficking in persons that are reported to\u00a0certain officials of the\u00a0Department of Defense (DOD).\u00a0Prohibits the head of an executive agency from entering into a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement valued at $1 million or more if performance will predominantly be conducted overseas unless a representative of the recipient of such grant, contract, or cooperative agreement certifies that the recipient has implemented a plan and procedures to prevent trafficking in persons. Requires a contracting or grant officer of an executive agency who receives credible evidence that a recipient of a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement has engaged in trafficking in persons or other prohibited activities to request the agency's Inspector General to investigate allegations of trafficking and to take remedial actions, including the suspension of payments under the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. Amends the federal criminal code to impose a fine and/or prison term of up to five years on any individual who knowingly and with intent to defraud recruits, solicits, or hires a person outside the United States, or attempts to do so,\u00a0to work on on a government contract performed on government facilities\u00a0outside the United States\u00a0by means of materially false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises regarding such employment."
