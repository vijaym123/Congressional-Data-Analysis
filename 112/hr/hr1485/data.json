Requires the Secretaries to prepare an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for each proposed eligible project and evaluate and consider an alternative recommendation if a project is or may be inconsistent with its community wildfire protection plan.
