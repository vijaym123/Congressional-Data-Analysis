  <summary>7/14/2011--Introduced.
Voter Protection Hotline Act of 2011 - Directs the Attorney General (AG) to establish and operate a toll-free telephone service, using a telephone number accessible throughout the United States using easily identifiable numerals, through which individuals may: (1) obtain information on voting in elections for federal office, including how to register to vote, the hours of operation of polling places, and how to obtain absentee ballots; and (2) report problems encountered in registering to vote or voting, including incidences of voter intimidation or suppression. Requires the AG to: (1) appoint individuals to a Voter Hotline Task Force, giving special consideration to individuals representing civil rights organizations, for ongoing analysis and assessment of the telephone service's operation; and (2) submit a report to Congress each odd-numbered year concerning voter intimidation or suppression reports made to the hotline and assessing the availability of the service to all U.S. households with telephone service.</summary>
