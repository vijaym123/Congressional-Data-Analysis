  <summary>6/19/2012--Passed House amended.
Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands Replacement Clarification Act - Amends the Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands Replacement Act to prohibit class II or III gaming activities on lands located north of latitude 33 degrees, 4 minutes north that the Tohono O'odham Nation was authorized to purchase in Arizona in exchange for granting the federal government all right, title, and interest to the Gila Bend Indian Reservation. Prohibits this gaming restriction from having any effect on any decision as to whether any lands located south of latitude 33 degrees, 4 minutes north and taken into trust pursuant to this Act qualify as lands taken into trust as part of a land claim settlement for purposes of determining whether gaming may be conducted on such lands.</summary>
