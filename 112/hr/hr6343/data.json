Requires the Secretary, before carrying out such conveyance, to assure compliance with all applicable requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and any other law applicable to the property conveyed. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress if such conveyance isn't completed within two years after such requirements are met. Terminates, on the date of such conveyance: (1) U.S. interest in and responsibility for the project and liability relating to the conveyed property; (2) a specified repayment contract between the United States and the District dated November 5, 1948; and (3) a specified payment obligation of the United States under the contract between the United States and the District for the forbearance of exercising priority water rights, dated August 21, 2009. Provides that all other terms of such forbearance agreement shall remain in effect for not less than 10 years after this Act's enactment. Provides that after conveyance of title under this Act: (1) the conveyed property shall not be considered to be a part of a federal reclamation project; and (2) the entity to which the property is conveyed shall not be eligible to receive any benefits, including federal project power, with respect to the conveyed property, except for benefits that would be available to a similarly situated entity with respect to property that is not part of a federal reclamation project."
