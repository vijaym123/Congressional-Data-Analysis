Lobbyist Disclosure Enhancement Act&#160; - Requires the Attorney General to establish the Lobbying Disclosure Act Enforcement Task Force.&#160; Grants such Task Force primary&#160;responsibility&#160;for investigating and prosecuting each case referred to the Attorney General under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995.&#160; Requires such Task Force to:&#160;(1) collect and disseminate information on the enforcement of such Act; (2) audit at least annually the extent of compliance with such Act; and (3) establish, publicize, and operate a toll-free telephone hotline for members of the public to report noncompliance with lobbyist disclosure requirements. Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to: (1) require notifications of noncompliance of lobbyist diclosure requirements to the&#160;Attorney General (instead of&#160; the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia); (2) amend the definition of "lobbyist" under such Act to eliminate the exemption from such Act of certain lobbyists who work for a client on a part-time basis; (3) require lobbyists to register with the Senate and House of Representatives within 5 days after a lobbying contact (currently, 45 days);&#160;and (4) expand disclosure requirements relating to contacts with executive&#160;and legislative branch officials and political contributions.</summary>
