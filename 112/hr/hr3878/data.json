Requires the Secretary to hold that property in trust for nine federally recognized Indian tribes in Oregon. Requires the tribes to agree to use the Chemawa Indian School property only for their educational or cultural benefit, or for other purposes that are authorized by the Chemawa Indian School Board of Trustees (Board) and approved by the Secretary. Prohibits gaming on such lands. Directs the Secretary to establish the Board, which is to be composed of nine trustees appointed by the tribes and two adjunct trustee advisors appointed by the Secretary. Authorizes the Board to assume operation of the Chemawa Indian School or use the trust land for purposes authorized by this Act if it enters into a self-determination or self-governance agreement with the Secretary regarding such assumption or use. Requires the Board to use land occupied by the Chemawa Indian School for the collective benefit of the Oregon tribes, if the Secretary certifies that it is no longer needed for Indian education."
