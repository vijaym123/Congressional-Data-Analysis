Makes it the duty of the Office to: (1) receive and assess comments from all interested parties with respect to project applications before FERC; (2) submit such comments to FERC, together with findings and recommendations, regarding the outcome, terms, and conditions of an application for approval; (3) review and assess applicant compliance with FERC orders; (4) seek full compliance with an order through the FERC or a court if the applicant fails to comply and such noncompliance is harmful to the health, safety, and welfare of affected parties; and (5) undertake appeal of any FERC order it deems harmful to the heath, safety, or welfare of affected parties.</summary>
