Medical Checklist Act of 2011 - Requires the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, acting through the Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety, to conduct research and a study regarding the development and efficacy of medical checklists, including regarding: (1) the testing of different models of medical checklists; (2) an examination of checklist development and use in other industries; and (3) a measurement of the effects of the use of medical checklists on patient safety and health outcomes. Requires dissemination of the results of such study to patient safety organizations. Defines "medical checklist" as a predetermined, evidence-based, well-defined set of steps that should be completed during a designated medical clinical encounter or medical procedure. Requires the HIT Policy Committee to develop policy recommendations regarding: (1) the extent to which the use of medical checklists should be incorporated into health information technology systems; and (2) measures to determine the effectiveness of such use. Requires the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Engineering of the National Academies to conduct a study on medical checklists that includes: (1) a review of available medical checklists and similar quality improvement techniques; (2) an identification of areas of research needed to improve medical checklists; (3) an analysis of organizational impediments to the adoption and use of medical checklists; and (4) a determination of whether the availability of an increased number of medical checklists would improve patient safety and health outcomes.</summary>
