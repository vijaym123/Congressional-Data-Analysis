  <summary>4/13/2011--Introduced.
Renewable Fuel Pipeline Act of 2011 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to allow federally-guaranteed loans for renewable fuel pipelines in amounts equal to 80% of the project cost as estimated at the time the guarantee is issued. Defines "renewable fuel" as fuel that: (1) is produced from renewable biomass and that is used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a transportation fuel; and (2) includes all types of ethanol and biodiesel. Prohibits&#160;the Secretary of Energy (DOE) from requiring a demonstration of existing contractual obligations for a specific minimum capacity of pipeline usage in determining whether there is a reasonable prospect of repayment with respect to a renewable fuel pipeline project. Authorizes the Secretary to make guarantees for projects that commence construction not later than September 30, 2013, for the installation of sufficient infrastructure to allow for the cost-effective deployment of clean energy technologies appropriate to each region of the United States, including renewable fuel pipelines.</summary>
