    "text": "Small Business Contracting Opportunities Expansion Act of 2012 - Amends the Small Business Act to raise from 23% to 26% the governmentwide prime contract award goal for participation by small business concerns and make the governmentwide subcontract participation award goal 40% for such businesses. Increases percentage goals for awards to qualified HUBZone [historically underutilized business zone] small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Requires such latter procurement goals, as well as goals for small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans and by women (collectively, the targeted groups), as established annually by the head of each federal agency participating in federal procurement contracts, to: (1) be at least the average percentage of participation that occurred over the last three fiscal years, (2) be in the same format as the goals established by the President, (3) address both prime contract and subcontract awards, and (4) meet or exceed the government-wide goals for each small business category. Requires each agency head to: (1) consult with the Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator in establishing agency goals, and (2) develop a plan for achieving agency goals. Prohibits the carrying out or establishing of any SBA pilot program if the Administrator does not issue a required annual report which compiles and analyzes each agency's performance with respect to procurement contract participation by small businesses. Requires the Comptroller General to study, and report to Congress on: (1) improving internal processes of federal procurement contracting agencies and increasing outreach to those groups that make up the small business categories, (2) legislative actions to improve participation in contracting by such groups, and (3) the feasibility of creating a governmentwide contract participation goal for small businesses owned and controlled by veterans. Increases, as of FY2017, the governmentwide small business participation goal as well as the goals for targeted groups."
