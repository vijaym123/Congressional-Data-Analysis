  <summary>12/4/2012--Introduced.
Virgin Islands Energy Crisis Relief Act - Amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), through the Rural Utilities Service, to make a grant to the Water and Power Authority of the U.S. Virgin Islands for energy generation, transmission, and distribution in rural communities with extremely high energy costs. Provides related funding through FY2015. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to the Authority to convert base power production in the Virgin Islands from fuel oil to liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas. Authorizes appropriations through FY2017. Increases, through FY2018, the number of Virgin Islands households eligible for low-income energy assistance.</summary>
