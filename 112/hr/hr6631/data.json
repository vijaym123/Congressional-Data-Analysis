Provides related funding through FY2015. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to the Authority to convert base power production in the Virgin Islands from fuel oil to liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas. Authorizes appropriations through FY2017. Increases, through FY2018, the number of Virgin Islands households eligible for low-income energy assistance."
