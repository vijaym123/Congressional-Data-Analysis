    "text": "Immigration and Naturalization Investment Ventures for Engineering, Science, and Technology in America Act of 2011 or INVEST in America Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide conditional permanent resident status for an alien entrepreneur (and spouse and children) who: (1) is in the process of completing, or has completed, a graduate level degree in science, technology, engineering, math or a related academic discipline from an accredited U.S. institute of higher education; (2) establishes a new commercial enterprise related to such study that meets specified employment and wage requirements; and (3) is admissible as an immigrant. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate such alien's status for fraud or failure to meet status requirements during the 60-month period after obtaining such status. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Education to submit a recruitment, retainment, and investment strategic plan to Congress to attract skilled and talented foreign nationals to immigrate to the United States to create jobs and grow the economy."
