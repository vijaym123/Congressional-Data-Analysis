Modifies limitations placed upon the allocation of such surface mining reclamation funds to provide for payments for filling voids and sealing tunnels and entryways of noncoal mines as well as coal mines. (\"Uncertified states and Indian tribes\" are those which have not certified to the Secretary of the Interior completion of their abandoned coal mine reclamation work.)"
