Authorizes the use of grant funds: (1) to establish or maintain and carry out a program to train public housing residents to provide covered home-based health care services to elderly and disabled public housing residents and to elderly and disabled residents of federally-assisted rental housing, (2) for the transportation and child care expenses of public housing residents in training, and (3) for the administrative expenses of carrying out such a program.Provides that for any resident of public housing who is trained as a home health aide or as a provider of home-based health services under the program, any income received for providing covered home-based health services shall apply towards eligibility for benefits under federal housing programs as specified, based on length of time following completion of the training.</summary>
