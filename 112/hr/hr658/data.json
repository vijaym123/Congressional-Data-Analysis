    "text": "FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 - Title I: Authorizations - Subtitle A: Funding of FAA Programs - (Sec. 101) Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) out of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for FY2012-FY2015 for: (1) airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning programs, (2) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air navigation facilities and equipment, and (3) FAA operations. (Sec. 103) Requires the Secretary, in cases where appropriations are insufficient to meet FAA operations, to reduce nonsafety-related FAA activity expenses to a level to meet such appropriations. (Sec. 104) Authorizes additional appropriations from the general fund of the Treasury for aviation programs through FY2015. (Sec. 105) Requires the FAA Administrator to include in the Airway Capital Investment Plan a list of capital projects that are part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). Subtitle B: Passenger Facility Charges - (Sec. 111) Converts to permanent the pilot program for passenger facility charges (PFCs) at nonhub airports. (Sec. 112) Requires the Comptroller General to study alternative means of collecting PFCs without their being included in the airline ticket price. (Sec. 113) Expresses the sense of Congress that airports should consider the use of qualifications-based selection in carrying out capital improvement projects funded using PFCs. Subtitle C: Fees for FAA Services - (Sec. 121) Revises requirements for establishment and adjustment of user overflight fees for FAA services. (Sec. 122) Directs the FAA Administrator to prescribe certain registration, certification, and other specified fees. Subtitle D: Airport Improvement Program Modifications - (Sec. 131) Revises airport improvement program (AIP) requirements. Directs the Secretary to encourage airport sponsors and state and local officials, in the development of their airport master plans, to consider as additional goals passenger convenience, airport ground access, and access to airport facilities. (Sec. 132) Extends the meaning of \"airport development,\" for AIP project grant purposes, to: (1) construction of mobile refueler parking within a fuel farm at a nonprimary airport meeting specified requirements; (2) terminal development; and (3) acquisition and installation of facilities and equipment to provide air conditioning, heating, or electric power from terminal-based, nonexclusive use facilities to aircraft parked at a public use airport. (Sec. 133) Requires an airport's master plan to address issues relating to solid waste recycling at the airport as a condition to the approval of an AIP project. (Sec. 134) Repeals the requirements that competition plans include patterns of air service and airfare levels. (Sec. 135) Revises requirements for written assurances on AIPs for acquiring land for a noise compatibility or airport purpose to allow for reinvestment in another specified kind of AIP of proceeds from disposition of the land proportional to the government's share of the cost of acquiring it.

(Sec. 137) Prescribes special rules for the federal share of allowable costs for AIP projects for: (1) transition from a small hub to medium hub airport status (90% share), and (2) economically distressed communities (95% share). (Sec. 138) Revises or adds new justifications for allowable AIP project costs, including costs incurred: (1) before execution of the grant agreement because the airport has a shortened construction season due to climactic conditions in the airport vicinity, or (2) on a measure to improve the efficiency of an airport building. Prescribes requirements for allowing the costs of relocating or replacing an airport-owned facility. Directs the FAA Administrator, upon the conclusion of all planned research regarding avian (bird) radar systems, to: (1) update Advisory Circular No. 150/5220-25 to specify which systems have been studied, and (2) issue a final report on their use in the national airspace system.

(Sec. 141) Authorizes the Secretary to apportion to an airport sponsor in a fiscal year an amount equal to the minimum amount apportioned to that sponsor in the previous fiscal year if: (1) the airport received scheduled or unscheduled air service from a large certificated air carrier, and (2) the airport had more than 10,000 passenger boardings in the preceding calendar year used to calculate the apportionment. Prescribes a special rule for FY2012-FY2013. Allows an airport sponsor apportionment in FY2012 or FY2013 equal to the amount apportioned to that sponsor in FY2009 for an airport: (1) that had more than 10,000 passenger boardings and scheduled passenger aircraft service in calendar year 2007; but (2) in either calendar years 2009 or 2010, or both years, the number of passenger boardings at the airport decreased to below 10,000 per year. (Sec. 142) Requires the Secretary to make minimum supplemental apportionments to Puerto Rico and all other U.S. territories for AIP projects. Declares that nothing in this section shall prohibit the Secretary from making discretionary fund grants for such projects. (Sec. 143) Revises the formula for reducing the amount apportioned for an AIP in a fiscal year to the sponsor of an airport having at least .25% of the total number of boardings each year in the United States and for which a passenger facility fee is imposed.

(Sec. 144) Extends through FY2015 the eligibility of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau for AIP grants. (Sec. 145) Revises requirements for special apportionments for airport noise compatibility planning and program grants to limit the dollar amount of the minimum 35% apportionment to a maximum of $300 million. Applies the same apportionment, also, to water quality mitigation projects approved in an environmental record of decision for an AIP project. (Sec. 146) Makes current or former military airports that preserve or enhance minimum airfield infrastructure facilities to support emergency diversionary operations for transoceanic flights eligible for certain discretionary grant funding used to develop current or former such airports. (Sec. 147) Prescribes a special rule that, if the Secretary determines that a contract air traffic control tower already operating under the low activity (Visual Flight Rules) Level I contract program has a benefit-to-cost ratio of less than 1.0, the airport sponsor or state or local government with jurisdiction over the airport shall not be required to pay the portion of the costs that exceeds the benefit for a period of 18 months. Establishes funding levels for FY2012-FY2015 for the air traffic control contract tower program. Increases the federal share of the cost of construction of a nonapproach control tower under the program. Directs the Secretary to establish uniform standards and requirements for safety assessments of air traffic control towers that receive funding under such program. (Sec. 148) Applies to foreign air carriers (under current law, applies only to domestic air carriers) requirements for resolution of airport fee disputes. (Sec. 149) Revises exceptions to the prohibition against use of local taxes on aviation fuel or the revenues generated by an airport for any purpose (revenue diversion) other than the capital or operating costs of the airport, the local airport system, or any other local facility owned or operated by the airport owner or operator that is directly and substantially related to the air transportation of passengers or property. Excepts from such prohibition any proceeds from the sale of a privately owned airport to a public sponsor that meets specified criteria, including repayment by the private owner to the Secretary of the remaining unamortized portion of any AIP grant to that airport. (Sec. 150) Repeals the prohibition against approval of any Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority application: (1) for an airport development project grant; or (2) to impose a PFC.

(Sec. 152) Limits the amount of discretionary funds the Secretary may distribute for terminal development projects at nonhub or small hub airports to $20 million. Revises reporting requirements of the Secretary's annual AIP report to Congress, moving its deadline from April 1 to June 1. (Sec. 153) Extends through FY2015 the authority for grants to state and local governments for compatible land use planning and projects.
