Teacher Exchange Act of 2011 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to authorize states to use their grant under part A (Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund) of title II of the ESEA to carry out a teacher exchange sending highly qualified teachers with at least three years of teaching experience to another state in a different region for a school year. Requires: (1) at least one of the states involved in an exchange to serve a high-need local educational agency (LEA), or (2) the states to be exchanging teachers in subjects that have a high need for qualified teachers. Requires states to maintain the employment terms of teachers participating in the exchange, cover their expenses, and provide them with training. Requires the teachers to return to their state following their participation in the exchange. Authorizes LEAs to use their subgrant under part A of title II of the ESEA to carry out a teacher exchange (regardless of whether or not their states are participating in the exchange) sending highly qualified teachers with at least three years of teaching experience to another LEA in a different region for a school year. Requires: (1) at least one of the LEAs involved in an exchange to be a high-need LEA, or (2) the LEAs to be exchanging teachers in subjects that have a high need for qualified teachers. Requires LEAs to maintain the employment terms of teachers participating in the exchange, cover their expenses, and provide them with training. Requires the teachers to return to their LEA following their participation in the exchange.</summary>
