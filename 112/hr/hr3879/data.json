    "text": "Refinery Streamlined Permitting Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to offer assistance to states to enable them to assign responsibilities delegated to them under federal law regarding coordinated and expeditious construction or expansion of a petroleum refining facility. Requires all federal agencies and state agencies responsible for approving federal authorization for the construction or expansion of such a facility to: (1) enter into a memorandum of understanding that clearly defines all actions required to be taken for federal permit review and approval; (2) take final action to approve or disapprove the application within one year after receipt of a completed application; (3) give high priority to expediting an application for a refining facility that would allow for production of cleaner burning fuel or result in increased refining capacity; and (4) submit a Statement of Energy Effects to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), for each proposed significant energy action. Requires the President to designate at least three closed military installations (or portions of them) appropriate for siting a refinery for gasoline or other fuel. Designates DOE as the lead agency for coordinating applicable federal refinery authorizations and related environmental reviews with respect to a designated refinery. Gives the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions relating to federal refinery authorizations."
