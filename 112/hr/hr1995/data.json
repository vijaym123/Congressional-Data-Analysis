Replaces references to pupil services and pupil services personnel with references to specialized instructional support services and specialized instructional support personnel. Defines such services as those provided by school counselors, social workers, psychologists, and other qualified professionals that provide assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs."
