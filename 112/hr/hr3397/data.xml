  <summary>9/10/2012--Passed House amended.
Cabin Fee Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to set an annual fee for, and requires the payment of such fee to the United States by, an authorized owner of a privately built and owned recreational cabin located on National Forest System land. Reduces such fee to $100 annually if access to a cabin is significantly impaired, either by natural causes or governmental actions. Requires payment of a transfer fee to the United States upon the transfer of a cabin between private parties for consideration. Requires the Secretary to grant a cabin owner the right to administrative appeal of a cabin fee decision, which may be reviewed by bringing a civil action in U.S. district court.</summary>
