    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) treat income and gains from the use, sale, or exchange of infrastructure property as qualifying income for purposes of the tax treatment of publicly-traded partnerships; (2) exempt publicly-traded partnerships from the limitation on the tax deduction for income attributable to oil-related qualified production activities; (3) allow accelerated depreciation of infrastructure property (i.e., classify such property as five-year property); and (4) treat exchanges of infrastructure property as like-kind exchanges (thus exempting gain from such exchanges from tax). Defines \"infrastructure property\" as property which is part of: (1) roads and related improvements; (2) train tracks and related improvements; (3) airports; (4) docks and wharves; (5) facilities for sewage, solid waste disposal, the furnishing of water, the transmission and distribution of natural gas, or the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity; or (6) communications facilities."
