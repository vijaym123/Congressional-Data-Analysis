  <summary>5/5/2011--Introduced.
Fix Gun Checks Act of 2011 - Amends the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NICS Act) to increase the amount of a state's allocation under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program that the Attorney General shall withhold to: (1) 15% for a period of 5 fiscal years if the state provides less than 75% of the records required to be provided under the NICS Act's requirements for making data electronically available to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (System), and (2) 25% thereafter if the state provides less than 90% of the records required. Authorizes the Attorney General to reduce the amount withheld to a specified percentage if a state provides substantial evidence that it is making a reasonable effort to comply. Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady Act) to: (1) require each federal agency to submit to the Attorney General a semiannual written certification indicating whether it has provided the pertinent information in any record in its possession identifying persons prohibited from purchasing or receiving firearms or ammunition, and (2) make federal court information available for inclusion in the System. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require each college, university, or postsecondary institution that receives federal funds or financial assistance to develop and implement a mental health assessment plan to address the risks posed by students who pose a safety risk to themselves or others and to make such plan available to students, faculty, and staff. Extends Brady Act background check procedures to unlicensed transferors and transferees of firearms. Specifies exceptions. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study to determine: (1) the effects that the NICS Act has had on state reporting to the System, (2) which states are in compliance and which are not, (3) any challenges or obstacles that states or local governments face in complying with the NICS Act's reporting requirements, and (4) states' compliance with NICS Act provisions regarding relief from the disabilities program required as a condition for participation in grant programs.</summary>
