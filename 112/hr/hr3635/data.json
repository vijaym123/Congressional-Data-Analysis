Defines \"small business loan program\" as a program in which a community development financial institution offers loans to small businesses that: (1) are made in amounts up to $25,000, (2) have no prepayment penalty, and (3) meet any affordability requirements established by Administrator of the Fund. Requires a community development financial institution to provide non-federal matching funds equal to 50% of the amount of any grant received. Prohibits the use of such grants to make direct loans to small businesses. Permits a community development financial institution to use such a grant to: (1) help recapture a portion or all of a defaulted loan made under its small business loan program, and (2) designate and utilize a fiscal agent for services the agent normally provides. Requires the Fund to make technical assistance grants to community development financial institutions to create, support, or maintain such a program."
