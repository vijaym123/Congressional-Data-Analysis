  <summary>10/27/2011--Introduced.
National Windstorm Impact Reduction Reauthorization Act of 2011 - Amends the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 to revise provisions governing the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. Designates the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the entity with primary responsibility for Program planning and coordination. Replaces provisions establishing an Interagency Working Group with provisions establishing the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction. Directs the Committee to submit a Strategic Plan for the Program that includes: (1) prioritized goals that will mitigate against the loss of life and property from future windstorms; (2) research objectives to achieve those goals; (3) a description of the role of each Program agency in achieving such goals; (4) the methods by which progress will be assessed; and (5) an explanation of how the Program will foster the transfer of research results into outcomes, such as improved model building codes. Requires the Committee to submit a progress report and to develop a coordinated budget for the Program, to be submitted at the time of the President's annual budget submission. Revises provisions providing for the establishment of an Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction (currently, the National Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction) to offer assessments of the Program, including assessments of the priorities of the Strategic Plan. Terminates the Committee on September 30, 2014. Authorizes appropriations to the agencies carrying out the Program for FY2012-FY2014.</summary>
