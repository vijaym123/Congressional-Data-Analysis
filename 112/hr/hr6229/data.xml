  <summary>7/30/2012--Introduced.
United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2012 - Amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to: (1) authorize the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) Administrator to appoint a Deputy Administrator (current law requires the Deputy Administrator to be appointed by the President), (2) authorize the USFA Administrator to take such steps as the Administrator considers appropriate to educate the public and overcome public indifference as to individual preparedness (as well as to fire and fire prevention), and (3) authorize appropriations to carry out such Act through FY2017. Repeals a provision that placed a cap on amounts made available to update the National Fire Incident Reporting System during FY2009-FY2011.</summary>
