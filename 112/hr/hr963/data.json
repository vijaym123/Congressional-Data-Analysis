Grants an authorized official who observes, or receives a report of, such activity and takes reasonable action in good faith to respond qualified immunity from civil liability for such action. Provides that an authorized official not entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity shall nonetheless be immune from civil immunity if that official takes reasonable action, in good faith, to respond to the reported activity. Entitles any authorized official or other person found to be immune from civil liability under this Act to recover all reasonable costs and attorney fees in any action against such official."
