(A CAH is a hospital certified to receive cost-based reimbursement from Medicare.) Prohibits a state from designating a facility as a CAH unless: (1) it was assigned a Medicare provider number as an acute inpatient hospital before enactment of this Act, and (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) determines that such designation would not result in the total number of facilities so designated in all states on or after enactment of this Act being greater than 10% of the total number of acute inpatient hospitals designated as CAHs in all states as of March 31, 2011."
