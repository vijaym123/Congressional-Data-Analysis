Provides that the requirement that state national pollutant discharge elimination system programs ensure that any board or body that approves permits excludes as a member any person who receives or has received during the previous two years a significant portion of income from permit holders or applicants shall have no force or effect after the earlier of the date on which such rule is issued or 120 days after this Act's enactment."
