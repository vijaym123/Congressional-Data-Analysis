  <summary>7/18/2012--Public Law.
District of Columbia Special Election Reform Act - Amends the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to require the Board of Elections and Ethics, in filling the following vacancies, to hold a special election in the District on the first Tuesday occurring between 70 and 174 days (currently, the first Tuesday occurring more than 114 days) after the vacancy occurs which the Board determines, based on a totality of the circumstances, taking into account, inter alia, cultural and religious holidays and the administrability of the election, will provide the greatest level of voter participation. Eliminates the specific alternative of a special election on the same day as the next general election (without eliminating the option of a special election on the same day as the next general election). Applies this revised special election requirement to: (1) the Office of the Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, (2) a Council member elected from a ward or elected at large, (3) the Office of the Mayor of the District, and (4) the Office of the Attorney General of the District.</summary>
