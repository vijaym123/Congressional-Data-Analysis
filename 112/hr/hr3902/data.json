Eliminates the specific alternative of a special election on the same day as the next general election (without eliminating the option of a special election on the same day as the next general election). Applies this revised special election requirement to: (1) the Office of the Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, (2) a Council member elected from a ward or elected at large, (3) the Office of the Mayor of the District, and (4) the Office of the Attorney General of the District."
