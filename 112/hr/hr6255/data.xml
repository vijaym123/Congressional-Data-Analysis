  <summary>8/1/2012--Introduced.
Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2012 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) implementation of the United States National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security (NAP) is paramount in improving the lives of women around the world and increasing global stability and prosperity; (2) Congress is committed to advancing the goals of NAP; and (3) the President should designate a person on the staff of the National Security Council (NSC) to be responsible for promoting NAP. States that: (1) it is U.S. policy to implement NAP; (2) the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) should integrate gender into diplomatic and strategic and planning processes; and (3) federal agencies shall ensure that the tenets of NAP are incorporated into programs for conflict prevention, humanitarian and disaster response, peacekeeping, and democracy promotion. Urges the Secretary, the Administrator, the Secretary of Defense (DOD), and representatives of other federal agencies to: (1) implement NAP and ensure relevant personnel training; and (2) facilitate partner government efforts to improve women's inclusion in peace and security processes, conflict prevention, peace-building, and decision-making institutions in conflict-affected environments.</summary>
