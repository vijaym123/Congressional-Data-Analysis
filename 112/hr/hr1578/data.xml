Reauthorizes and revises a program to provide training to health care professionals on domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, including by: (1) placing the program in the Office of Women's Health; (2) including public health staff and allied health professionals in such program; (3) expanding the types of entities eligible for grants; (4) expanding the use of the grants to include developing training for psychology and social work students or providers; and (5) eliminating the matching requirement.
