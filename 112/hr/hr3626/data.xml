  <summary>12/8/2011--Introduced.
LIHEAP Protection Act - Makes appropriations for FY2012 for the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Expresses the sense of Congress that this Act should be implemented in a manner consistent with the Budget Control Act of 2011, and that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) should: (1) continue and expedite efforts to identify best practices used by LIHEAP grant recipients; (2) provide training and technical assistance to such grant recipients; (3) recommend policy changes, and assess and mitigate risk at governmental levels in order to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse; and (4) strengthen the Program so all funds reach the households who need them the most.</summary>
