  <summary>1/5/2011--Introduced.
Border Security, Cooperation, and Act Now Drug War Prevention Act of 2011 - Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Attorney General to provide to a state on a U.S. border up to 500 additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) agents to patrol and defend the border, combat drug trafficking, and combat smuggling of firearms, explosives, alcohol, and tobacco if the state's governor declares an international border security emergency and requests such agents. Directs the Secretary&#160; to: (1) increase the number of U.S. Border Patrol helicopters and power boats; (2) establish a fleet of motor vehicles appropriate for use by the Border Patrol; (3) equip such motor vehicles with portable computers with access to law enforcement databases; (4) augment existing radio communication systems in areas in which the Border Patrol operates; and (5) provide Border Patrol agents with global positioning system devices, night vision equipment, high-quality body armor, reliable and effective weapons, and uniforms. Establishes the ATF, DEA, and Border Patrol Task Force to monitor and report to Congress and the President on the trade and sale of drugs, alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives along U.S. borders. Authorizes the Attorney General to make border security grants to sheriffs' offices and police departments in counties within 25 miles of the southern U.S. border.</summary>
