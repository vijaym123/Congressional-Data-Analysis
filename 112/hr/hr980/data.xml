District of Columbia Local Funds Continuation Act - Amends the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to appropriate, out of any moneys of the District of Columbia government not otherwise appropriated, and out of applicable corporate or other revenues, receipts, and funds, the amount provided for any project or activity for which funds are provided in the local budget act for such fiscal year, if the regular District of Columbia appropriation bill for a fiscal year does not become law before the beginning of such fiscal year. Declares that an appropriation and funds made available or authority granted for a project or activity for a fiscal year under this Act shall be at the rate of operations provided for it under the local budget act for the fiscal year. Makes such an appropriation and funds available for the period: (1) beginning with the first day of the fiscal year, and (2) ending with the enactment of the regular District of Columbia appropriation bill for such fiscal year. Specifies restrictions on programs or activities subject to other appropriations Acts. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to effect obligations of the District government mandated by other law.</summary>
