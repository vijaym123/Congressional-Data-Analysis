  <summary>10/5/2012--Public Law.
(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on September 11, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 to specify that ownership of a valid federal registration of a mark is a complete bar to an action with respect to the mark that: (1) is brought by another person under the common law or a statute of a state; and (2) seeks to prevent dilution (by blurring or by tarnishment) or asserts any claim of actual or likely damage or harm to the distinctiveness or reputation of a mark, label, or form of advertisement. (Removes any such federal-registration defense with respect to dilution claims under federal law and specifies that such a defense is only available in response to dilution claims under state law.)</summary>
