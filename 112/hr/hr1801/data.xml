  <summary>1/3/2012--Public Law.
Risk-Based Security Screening for Members of the Armed Forces Act - Directs the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration [TSA]) to develop and implement a plan for expedited security screening services for a uniformed Armed Forces member, and, to the extent possible, accompanying family, if the member, while in uniform, presents documentation indicating official orders for air transportation departing from a primary airport. Requires the Assistant Secretary to consider certain protocols in developing the plan. Declares that nothing in this Act shall affect the Assistant Secretary's authority to require additional screening of an Armed Forces member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that it is necessary.</summary>
