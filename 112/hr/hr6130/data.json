Requires consular officers, in issuing visas to applicants seeking to visit the United States temporarily for pleasure, to give priority to those intending to visit a national heritage area or national park. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to support infrastructure projects: (1) in communities hosting such heritage areas or parks, (2) that have been prioritized for completion by an applicable metropolitan planning organization, and (3) that are determined beneficial to the upkeep of roads or bridges used by international visitors to these regions."
