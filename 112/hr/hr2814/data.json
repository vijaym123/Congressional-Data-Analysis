Ratifies and approves all actions taken by federal employees, contractors, and grantees to maintain the essential level of government operations, services, and activities to protect life and property and to bring about orderly termination of government functions during such lapse, if otherwise in accord with the provisions of the Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2011, Part IV. Requires funds used by the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to compensate such employees to be: (1) derived from funds previously authorized out of the Airport and Airway Fund and made available or limited to DOT by the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011; and (2) subject to the obligation limitations established in such Act."
