Limits the non-federal share of the cost of carrying out a levee system evaluation and certification to 35% of the total cost, but requires the Secretary to adjust the non-federal share to zero if: (1) the non-federal interest is located in an area with a population of 10,000 or fewer individuals, or (2) the division of the non-federal interest with responsibility for the applicable levee is staffed by individuals operating on a volunteer basis."
