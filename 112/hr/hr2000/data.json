Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to check against terrorist watchlists those persons suspected of alien smuggling and smuggled individuals who are interdicted at U.S. borders. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act and specified maritime law sections to revise alien smuggling provisions. Sets forth provisions respecting border security on certain federal lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) or the Secretary of the Interior. Amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to make the E-verify program permanent. Sets forth conditions for the mandatory use of the E-verify system. Requires: (1) employer/employee notification of social security number mismatches and multiple uses, and related information sharing with DHS; and (2) establishment of electronic birth and death registration systems. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) penalize specified employers for failure to correct information returns; and (2) prohibit employers from deducting from gross income wages paid to unauthorized aliens, with an exception for an employer participating in the basic employment eligibility confirmation program. Increases criminal alien program (CAP) personnel. Authorizes border relief grants for local law enforcement agencies within 25 miles of the southern U.S. border. Establishes within DHS a rewards program to assist in the elimination of commercial operations to produce or sell fraudulent immigration-related documents and to assist in the investigation, prosecution, or disruption of commercial alien smuggling operations. Provides for: (1) increased alien detention facilities, (2) additional immigration court judgeships, and (3) a media campaign to inform the public of changes made by this Act including a multilingual media campaign explaining noncompliance penalties."
