  <summary>5/18/2012--Introduced.
Amends the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act to permit a valid voter registration and absentee ballot request submitted by an absent U.S. military or civilian overseas voter with respect to an election for a U.S. federal office to be treated as a request for each subsequent election held in that person's normal state of residence through the next regularly scheduled general election. Provides an exception for voters changing their state of registration. Prohibits a state from refusing to accept or process an otherwise valid absentee registration or ballot application from such voters on the grounds that it was submitted before the date on which such state accepts or processes such applications from domestic voters.</summary>
