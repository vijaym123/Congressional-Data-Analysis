  <summary>8/2/2012--Introduced.
American Energy Independence and Domestic Refining Capacity Act - Establishes the Commission on Energy Independence and Domestic Refining Capacity, which shall, at the request of the President, conduct a study to determine whether the consolidation or closing of a refinery will result in an adverse decline in the nation's domestic refining capacity. Requires that such study examine: (1) the state of the domestic refining industry, including the effect of the consolidation or refinery closure on overall production, domestic economic growth, and national gas prices; (2) the possibilities for the federal government to form public-private partnerships that would lead to increased domestic refining capacity; (3) the potential positive and adverse consequences of federal partnerships and incentives on growth within the industry; (4) the potential benefits of reinvesting a portion of revenues from public-private partnerships into energy related science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education, and seeding future federally funded energy research; and (5) the types of federal incentives that could be used to maintain domestic refining capacity. Requires the Commission to report the results of such study within three months after it is requested. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy (DOE), if the study finds that a plant consolidation or closure will have an adverse effect on the nation's domestic refining capacity, to offer federal incentives to prevent the diminishment of refining capacity.</summary>
