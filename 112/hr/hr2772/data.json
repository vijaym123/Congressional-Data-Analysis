Sets forth procedures for: (1) certifying a fishery management plan (or amendment) requested by a percentage of eligible fisherman to establish a limited access privilege program to harvest in fisheries under the authority of the New England, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, or Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council; (2) terminating such a program established after enactment of this Act for a fishery under the authority of such Councils on the first date the number of eligible fishermen in the fishery in a year is at least 15% less than in the year preceding the program's establishment; and (3) collecting fees, including observer costs, pursuant to modified fee-setting requirements for such programs."
