    "text": "Repeals provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 related to: (1) the disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotment for Tennessee and Hawaii; (2) an adjustment to the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for qualifying disaster-recovery states; (3) the establishment of a floor on the area wage index for a frontier state for purposes of a geographic adjustment to Medicare payments to hospitals for inpatient services; (4) the eligibility for Medicare coverage of certain individuals exposed to environmental health hazards; and (5) the appropriation of funds for debt service on, or direct construction or renovation of, a health care facility that provides research, inpatient, tertiary care, or outpatient clinical service. Amends PPACA to eliminate revisions to the formula for determining the wage index applicable to Section 508 hospitals. (Section 508 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 allows the temporary reclassification of a hospital with a low Medicare area wage index to a nearby location with a higher index so that the hospital will receive the higher Medicare reimbursement rate.) Makes this Act effective as if it were included in PPACA or, if applicable, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010."
