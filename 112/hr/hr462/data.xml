  <summary>1/26/2011--Introduced.
Tax Code Termination Act - Terminates the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 after December 31, 2015, except for self-employment taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)&#160;taxes, and railroad retirement taxes. Requires a two-thirds majority vote in Congress to change such termination date. Declares that any new federal tax system should be a simple and fair system that: (1) applies a low rate to all Americans; (2) provides tax relief for working Americans; (3) protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces tax collection abuses; (4) eliminates the bias against savings and investment; (5) promotes economic growth and job creation; and (6) does not penalize marriage or families. Requires that the new federal tax system be approved by Congress in its final form by July 4, 2015.</summary>
