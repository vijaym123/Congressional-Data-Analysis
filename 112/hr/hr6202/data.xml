  <summary>7/25/2012--Introduced.
True Cost of Coal Act of 2012 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) impose a $10 per ton excise tax on the extraction of coal; (2) establish in the Treasury the Coal Mitigation Trust Fund to hold revenues from such tax; and (3) extend to 50 years the recovery period, for depreciation purposes, for specified coal port property used for the export of coal. Allows expenditures from the Coal Mitigation&#160;Trust Fund to assist states&#160;in mitigating noise, vibration, traffic delays, pollution and other threats to public health, and emergencies in connection with the transportation of coal by rail, and&#160;to provide worker adjustment assistance. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to issue regulations to require all rail cars transporting coal to be covered or to incorporate a suitable alternative technology to ensure that coal and coal dust do not escape during transportation.</summary>
