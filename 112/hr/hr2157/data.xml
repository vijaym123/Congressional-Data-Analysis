  <summary>4/24/2012--Passed House without amendment.
Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), in any land exchange involving the conveyance of certain National Forest System land within the boundaries of Inyo National Forest in California, to accept for acquisition in such exchange certain non-federal lands in California lying outside the boundaries of the Forest, if acquiring them is desirable for National Forest System purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to accept a cash equalization payment that exceeds 25%. Requires any such payment to be deposited into the Treasury account established under the Sisk Act and made available for the acquisition of land for addition to the System. Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as granting the Secretary new land exchange authority. States that this Act modifies the use of land exchange authorities already available to the Secretary as of the enactment of this Act.</summary>
