    "text": "Learn to Earn Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Education to designate a local educational agency (LEA) as an entrepreneurship community if it is carrying out a high-quality entrepreneurship education program for secondary school students. Requires those programs to include: (1) high standards in mathematics and related content areas, such as economics; (2) curricula delivered by high-quality teachers who complete entrepreneurship training and receive ongoing professional development; (3) hands-on activities and project-based work; (4) financial literacy education; and (5) interaction between students, teachers, and members of the business community. Directs the Secretary, to the extent practicable, to give priority to entrepreneurship communities when awarding competitive grants to LEAs under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to give priority, to the extent practicable, to an entrepreneurship partner entity when awarding competitive grants, loans, or loan guarantees related to small business, workforce, community, or economic development. Defines an \"entrepreneurship partner entity\" as a local business, community organization, SBA office, chamber of commerce, or state, local, or tribal entity that enters into an agreement with an entrepreneurship community and specializes in entrepreneurship, small business development, or workforce development."
