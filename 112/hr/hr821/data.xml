Requires the&#160; Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to&#160;publish guidelines to carry out this Act&#160;that shall require: (1) the baseline budget of each agency to be assumed to be zero, and (2) each proposed expenditure to be justified as if it were a new expenditure.</summary>
