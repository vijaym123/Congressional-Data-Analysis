  <summary>11/3/2011--Introduced.
Creating Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2011 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish tax-exempt housing equity savings accounts to assist individual taxpayers under the age of 55 in paying the costs of acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a principal residence. Allows: (1) a deduction from gross income for cash contributions to such accounts for the lesser of $10,000 or the compensation includible in the taxpayer's gross income for a taxable year, (2) an exclusion from gross income of amounts distributed from such accounts that are used by an account beneficiary to purchase a principal residence or make payments to such beneficiary's individual retirement account (IRA), and (3) a tax-free rollover into an IRA if an account beneficiary reaches age 55 or has maintained an account for 20 years without purchasing a residence.</summary>
