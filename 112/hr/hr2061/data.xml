  <summary>12/20/2011--Public Law.
(Although this measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House, the text was changed by H. Con. Res. 86, which made enrollment corrections, and the summary has been modified as necessary.) Civilian Service Recognition Act of 2011 - Authorizes a federal executive agency head to: (1) give a U.S. flag for an individual who was an agency employee and who died of employment-related injuries suffered as a result of a criminal act, an act of terrorism, a natural disaster, or other circumstance as determined by the President, upon the request of the employee's widow or widower, child, sibling, or parent, or other another individual other than the next of kin as determined by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); and (2) disclose unclassified information that does not endanger national security to show that such employee is eligible to receive a flag. Requires agency heads to provide appropriate notice to agency employees of the flag benefit provided by this Act. Defines "employee" for purposes of this Act to include an officer or employee of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) or the Postal Regulatory Commission.</summary>
