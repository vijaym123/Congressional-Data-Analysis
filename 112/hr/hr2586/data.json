Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in interpreting or defining a \"security-based swap execution facility,\" from requiring such a facility to do any of the things the CFTC is prohibited by this Act from requiring, with the exception that the SEC may not require such a facility to limit the means of interstate commerce used by market participants to enter into and execute security-based swap transactions on the method of trading functionality."
