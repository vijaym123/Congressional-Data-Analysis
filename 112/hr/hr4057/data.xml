(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on December 19, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop a comprehensive policy to improve outreach and transparency to veterans and members of the Armed Forces (members) through the provision of information on institutions of higher learning. Requires such information to: (1) include accreditation information and a description of available federal aid programs, and (2) be provided through hyperlinks on the VA website. Requires the Secretary, in developing the policy, to conduct a market survey to determine the availability of a commercially available off-the-shelf online tool that: (1) allows veterans to determine whether they are academically ready to engage in postsecondary education and training opportunities, and (2) provides a list of providers of such opportunities. Directs the Secretary to report to the congressional veterans and education committees on: (1) the policy developed, (2) a plan to implement the policy, and (3) survey results. Prohibits the Secretary from approving an educational institution that provides any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based on success in securing enrollments. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the VA provides assistance to personnel of educational institutions who are charged with submitting reports or certifications to the VA. Prohibits the Secretary from paying more than $395 million in VA employee incentive awards or performance bonuses during FY2013.</summary>
