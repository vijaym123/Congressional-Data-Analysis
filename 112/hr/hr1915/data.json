Gives Congress's consent to such compacts. Removes the requirement that a health plan under such a compact be a qualified health plan. Authorizes Congress to revoke consent for such compacts by passing a joint resolution. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt an individual covered under a plan subject to such a compact from the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage."
