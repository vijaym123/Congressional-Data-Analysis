  <summary>3/11/2011--Introduced.
State Right to Vote Act - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to declare that nothing in the Act shall be construed to authorize or recognize a labor organization as the representative of employees in a state where recognition of the labor organization is prohibited, unless the labor organization has been selected by a majority of such employees in a secret ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Prohibits a federal agency from bringing a challenge against a state statute or constitutional provision which protects the right of employees to choose labor organization representatives through secret ballot elections.</summary>
