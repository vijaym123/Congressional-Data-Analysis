  <summary>6/5/2012--Public Law.
Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2012 - Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) subject anyone who attempts or conspires to construct or finance construction of an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage that crosses the international border between the United States and another country, or to use such a tunnel for smuggling, to the penalties prescribed for someone who commits such an offense; (2) make such a border tunnel offense a predicate offense for a money laundering violation and for authorization for interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications; and (3) provide for the criminal forfeiture of proceeds of such an offense and the seizure and forfeiture of merchandise introduced into the United States through such a tunnel. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should continue outreach efforts to educate landowners and tenants in areas along the border between Mexico and the United States about cross-border tunnels and seek their assistance in combating tunnel construction. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit an annual report describing: (1) cross-border tunnels along the U.S.-Mexico border discovered during the preceding fiscal year; and (2) the needs of DHS to effectively prevent, investigate, and prosecute construction of such tunnels.</summary>
