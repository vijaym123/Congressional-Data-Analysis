Expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should continue outreach efforts to educate landowners and tenants in areas along the border between Mexico and the United States about cross-border tunnels and seek their assistance in combating tunnel construction. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit an annual report describing: (1) cross-border tunnels along the U.S.-Mexico border discovered during the preceding fiscal year; and (2) the needs of DHS to effectively prevent, investigate, and prosecute construction of such tunnels."
