Skin Cancer Prevention, Education, and Consumer Right-To-Know Act - Requires the proposed rule issued by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA) pertaining to over-the-counter sunscreen drug products to take effect 180 days after enactment of this Act, unless the Commissioner issues a final rule that includes formulation, labeling, and testing requirements for both ultraviolet B (UVB) and ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation protection before such time. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement a general, nationwide education campaign identifying the risks posed by sun exposure without the use of a sunscreen providing broad-spectrum protection.</summary>
