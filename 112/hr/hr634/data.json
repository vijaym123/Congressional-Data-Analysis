Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to require a sequestration of federal spending equivalent to the estimated aggregate amount designated by taxpayers under this Act to reduce the public debt. Prohibits any reduction in social security retirement benefits, veterans benefits, or interest payments on federal debt as a result of any such sequestration."
