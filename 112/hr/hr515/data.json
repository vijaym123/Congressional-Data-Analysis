Includes among the criteria that the government of Belarus must meet in order to end U.S. sanctions: (1) release of individuals who were jailed based on political beliefs or expression in connection with the repression that attended the December 2010 presidential election; (2) prosecution of senior leadership of the government of Belarus responsible for violations of human rights violations, including human rights violations in connection with the presidential election; (3) withdrawal of politically motivated legal charges against opposition activists and independent journalists in connection with the presidential election; and (4) holding free and transparent presidential and parliamentary elections consistent with Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) standards and under OSCE supervision. Authorizes the denial of U.S. entry to members of the security or law enforcement services who have participated in the crackdown on opposition leaders, journalists, and peaceful protesters or in the persecution of religious groups or human rights defenders. Requires that the President's annual Belarus report to Congress include information about government of Belarus cooperation with any foreign government or organization related to Internet censorship or surveillance or the purchase or receipt of any technology or training for such purposes."
