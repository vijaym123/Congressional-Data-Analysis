National Flood Research and Education Act of 2011 - Establishes within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) an Office of Flood Research and Policy, headed by a Director. Requires the Director to: (1) establish and oversee a National Flood Research and Education Consortium; (2) make recommendations and identify best practices for predicting, preventing, and minimizing flooding and its effects; (3) establish and maintain a page on the NOAA website; (4) select an institution of higher education to serve as the Lead Partner Institution (LPI) to head the Consortium and additional institutions to participate in the Consortium; and (5) review applications that have been approved by LPI and award grants for demonstration projects to implement such recommendations and best practices or to test techniques, strategies, technologies, methods, tools, and models for predicting, preventing, and minimizing flooding and its effects. Requires each member of the Consortium to conduct research, and develop undergraduate and graduate courses, on flooding, flood prevention, and other flood-related issues. Directs LPI to: (1) establish a center to plan, coordinate, and facilitate research and information sharing among Consortium members; (2) review and approve grant applications; (3) oversee demonstration projects funded by grant awards; and (4) establish and maintain a website for the Consortium.</summary>
