Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), if a state has submitted such a plan, from promulgating, implementing, or enforcing any requirement pursuant to a federal implementation plan under the CAA with respect to such facility for such purpose. Makes this Act applicable until January 1, 2022."
