Security Enhancement and Jobs Act of 2011 - Transfers from the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security (DOT) to the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) the authority to approve, within 120 days after receipt, any application of an airport operator to have the screening of passengers and property at an airport be carried out by the screening personnel of a qualified private screening company (security screening opt-out program). Requires the Secretary to approve such an application unless approval would compromise security, detrimentally affect the efficiency or effectiveness of screening, or otherwise adversely affect the mission of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Authorizes the Secretary to carry out this Act acting through the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (TSA).</summary>
