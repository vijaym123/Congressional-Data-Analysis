Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act - Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to publish the American National Standard for Single and Multiple Station Carbon Monoxide Alarms and the American National Standard for Gas and Vapor Detectors and Sensors as mandatory consumer product safety standards. Authorizes the CPSC to initiate a rulemaking to amend either standard to include any provision reasonably necessary to ensure the safe and effective operation of carbon monoxide alarms. Requires the CPSC to establish a grant program to provide assistance to states and local governments that require approved carbon monoxide alarms to be installed in dwelling units to carry out specified carbon monoxide poisoning prevention activities.</summary>
