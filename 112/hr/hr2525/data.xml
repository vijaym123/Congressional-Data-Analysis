  <summary>7/13/2011--Introduced.
Trade Adjustment Assistance Accountability Act of 2011 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to extend and authorize appropriations for the trade adjustment assistance (TAA) program for workers through FY2014. Requires the Secretary of Labor, with respect to a petition for the certification of eligibility to apply for TAA for a group of workers adversely affected by import competition, to send written or electronic notification of the receipt of the petition, and the initiation of the investigation of such petition, directly to the petitioners. Requires the Secretary to obtain from the workers' firm, a customer of the workers' firm, or the petitioner, through questionnaires and other appropriate means, information that the Secretary determines is necessary to certify a group of workers as eligible to apply for TAA. Authorizes the Secretary to seek additional information by: (1) contacting officials, employees, or customers of the workers' firm, as well as officials of certified or recognized unions or other duly authorized workers' representatives, or one-stop operators or partners; and (2) reviewing all certifications or denials of petitions for TAA within the same industry as the petitioner and considering the impact of trade on such determinations. Requires the Secretary to notify the petitioner of any information submitted or certified as part of an investigation that was adverse to the petitioner's claim, as well as allow the petitioner to review any non-protected documents, in cases where the petition for certification has been denied and the petitioner appeals. Requires the Secretary to provide a written or electronic response to a written request for information from the petitioner regarding the status of the petition at least 60 days after a petition or appeal is filed.</summary>
