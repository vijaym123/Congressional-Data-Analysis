Just Do Your Job Act of 2011 - Prohibits, during the portion of FY2011 that occurs after the enactment of this Act, payments for the salaries and expenses of the House and Senate Budget Committees. Reduces by $1 million for such period the amount otherwise made available for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Majority Leader of each chamber. Makes such requirements inapplicable to a chamber if it has adopted a concurrent resolution on the budget for FY2011 or FY2012 that complies with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.</summary>
