Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2012 - Directs the Attorney General to make grants to assist states with the costs associated with the implementation of DNA arrestee collection processes. Defines "DNA arrestee collection process" to mean a process under which a state provides for the collection, for inclusion in the National DNA Index System, of DNA profiles or DNA data from individuals who are at least 18 years of age who are arrested for or charged under state law with homicide or a criminal offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year involving a sexual act or sexual contact with another, kidnaping or abduction, burglary, or aggravated assault. Sets forth requirements regarding grant applications and the allocation of grant funds. Conditions receipt of a grant on a state having a procedure in place to provide written notification of expungement provisions and instructions to all persons who submit a DNA profile or DNA data and on an appropriate public website. Makes expungement requirements under the DNA Identification Act of 1994 applicable to any DNA profile or DNA data collected pursuant to this Act for inclusion in the System. Amends the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2009 to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to implement a DNA arrestee collection process consistent with this Act.</summary>
