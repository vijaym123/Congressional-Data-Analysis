Prohibits the Government Printing Office (GPO) from printing more than the minimum number of copies of the Record necessary for archival purposes. Requires the Public Printer to: (1) determine that minimum number of copies, and (2) ensure the most cost-effective printing of it. Requires GPO to make the Record publicly available on GPO's Web site in a format which enables it to be downloaded and printed by users. Repeals: (1) the authority of the Librarian of Congress to furnish a copy of the daily and bound Record to the Undersecretary of State for External Affairs of Canada in exchange for a copy of the Parliamentary Hansard, and (2) the Public Printer's requirement to honor the requisition. Repeals the authority of the Public Printer, under the direction of the Joint Committee, to sell: (1) subscriptions to the daily Record; and (2) current, individual numbers and bound sets of it."
