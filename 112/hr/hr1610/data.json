Specifies \"net\" counterparty exposure, thus stating that the major swap participant's outstanding swaps create substantial net counterparty exposure that could have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the U.S. banking system or financial markets. Declares capital and margin requirements governing swap dealers and major swap participants inapplicable to swaps in which one of the counterparties is not: (1) a swap dealer or major swap participant; (2) a specified kind of investment fund; (3) a commodity pool; or (4) the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or any affiliate, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or any affiliate, or a Federal Home Loan Bank. Exempts from margin requirements under the CEA and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 any swaps entered into before the date upon which specified final rules must be published under the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act."
