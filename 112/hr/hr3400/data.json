  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2011-11-10", 
    "text": "Jobs Through Growth Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) repeal the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for individual taxpayers after 2010, (2) allow an individual taxpayer to elect an alternative income tax system in lieu of existing rates, (3) allow an inflation adjustment to the cost of certain capital assets for purposes of determining gain or loss from the sale or exchange of such assets, (4) reduce the top income tax rate on corporations to 25%, (5) extend through 2012 the election allowed to a U.S. corporation to deduct dividends received from a controlled foreign corporation and reduce the amount of such deduction for corporations that fail to maintain specified employment levels for full-time U.S. employees, and (6) repeal the estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes and make permanent the maximum 35% gift tax rate and a $5 million lifetime gift tax exemption. Requires the House Committee on Ways and Means to report legislation to broaden the tax base for the corporate income tax and to transition to a territorial tax system (taxation of domestic income but not income earned overseas). Prohibits a federal agency from taking any significant regulatory action (generally, an action having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or otherwise adversely affecting the economy) until the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports a monthly unemployment rate equal to or less than 7.7%. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition if the President notifies Congress that a waiver is necessary on the basis of national security or a national emergency. Allows judicial review of a significant regulatory action by a person adversely affected or aggrieved by such action. Exempts businesses with 200 or fewer employees from federal regulation. Revises provisions for congressional review of agency rulemaking to require congressional approval of major rules of the executive branch before they may take effect (currently, major rules take effect unless Congress passes and the President signs a joint resolution disapproving them). Provides that if a joint resolution of approval of a major rule is not enacted by the end of 70 session days or legislative days after the agency proposing the rule submits its report on such rule to Congress, the rule shall be deemed not to be approved and shall not take effect. Sets forth House and Senate procedures for joint resolutions approving major rules and disapproving non-major rules. Amends the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) to revise the regulatory process (rulemaking) with respect to small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). Defines \"economic impact\" with respect to a proposed or final rule to mean: (1) any direct economic effect of a rule on small entities, and (2) any indirect economic effect on such entities, including potential job creation or job loss. Expands judicial review of agency rulemaking to permit small entities to seek judicial review of initial regulatory flexibility analyses and to obtain an injunction of a proposed rule that is noncompliant with RFA requirements. Requires each federal agency to establish a plan for the periodic review (every eight years) of: (1) its rules that have a significant adverse economic impact on small entities, and (2) any small entity compliance guide required to be published by an agency. Sets forth criteria for review of a rule, including the continued need for the rule, the complexity of the rule, and the impact of the rule on small entities. Terminates any rule if the issuing agency has failed to complete a required periodic review. Expands to all federal agencies the procedures for gathering comments on rules that will have a significant economic impact on small entities. Extends RFA requirements to informal agency guidance documents. Amends the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 to require each federal agency to review on a periodic basis its policies or programs for imposing regulatory penalties on small entities. Allows a small business concern to elect to be exempt from any rule or regulation issued on or after January 1, 2008. Sets forth a deadline for action on certain permit applications under existing Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases. Amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to repeal the moratorium on oil and gas leasing in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Instructs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to offer for leasing areas made available as a result of such repeal. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) offer specified areas for oil and gas leasing pursuant to certain Lease Sale Schedules, (2) conduct OCS lease sales in specified Planning Areas, (3) share OCS receipts derived from all leases with states and local governments, (4) implement a leasing program for certain land within the Arctic Coastal Plain, and (5) issue rights-of-way and easements across the Coastal Plain for oil and gas transportation. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to designate certain Coastal Plain lands, including the Sadlerochit Spring area, as Special Areas requiring special management and regulatory protection. Revokes a specified Secretarial Order relating to protecting wilderness characteristics on lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Amends the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 to repeal the prohibition on the use of funds for either a commercial oil shale leasing program or for oil shale lease sales. Directs the Secretary to offer leases for oil shale resources. Confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for covered energy projects under this Act. Establishes the Office of the Federal Oil and Gas Permit Coordinator. Instructs the Secretary to establish and maintain, in coordination with the Mayor of the North Slope Borough of Alaska, a separate Alaska Offshore Continental Shelf Coordination Office to coordinate the leasing program. Amends the Clean Air Act to redefine \"air pollutant\" to exclude carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride (greenhouse gases). Declares that nothing in specified statutes addressing pollution control shall be treated as authorizing or requiring the regulation of climate change or global warming. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to repeal the prohibition against federal procurement of alternative or synthetic fuel. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), upon request of the governor of a state or the governing body of an Indian tribe, to enter into a streamlined refinery permitting agreement. Sets forth deadlines for: (1) approval or disapproval of consolidated permits for construction of new or expansion of existing refineries, and (2) submission of existing refinery permit applications. Requires the EPA Administrator to conduct a research and demonstration program to evaluate the air quality benefits of ultra-clean Fischer-Tropsch transportation fuel, including diesel and jet fuel. Directs the Secretary to extend by one year the term of any lease that was: (1) not producing as of April 30, 2010; or (2) suspended from operations, permit processing, or consideration in accordance with the moratorium set forth in a May 30, 2010, Minerals Management Service Notice, or the Secretary's decision memorandum dated July 12, 2010. Directs the President, acting through the Secretary of Energy (DOE), to coordinate with specified federal agencies to ensure an expedited schedule for construction and operation of the Keystone XL pipeline. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States must decrease its dependence on oil from countries hostile to its interests; and (2) Canada has long been a strong trading partner, and increased access to its energy resources will create jobs in the United States."
