  <summary>3/3/2011--Introduced.
Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to prohibit the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from updating a flood plain area or a flood risk zone in a geographic area that meets the following conditions: (1) the area is intended to be protected by a levee that the Army Corps of Engineers determines has a design deficiency; (2) the entity responsible for the repair of such levee has implemented a repair plan that has been developed by the Corps or a professional licensed engineer and approved by the Corps or FEMA, that is based on sufficient and reasonably current design data that accurately reflects the condition of such levee and other flood protection facilities in the area, that will provide protection from the 1% annual chance flood for the area, and that includes an adequate financing mechanism; and (3) each state or local government with jurisdiction over any portion of the geographic area has implemented a surveillance and operations plan to provide for timely alerts and immediate remedial action when significant underseepage or potential failure occurs, has an evacuation plan, and has implemented an outreach and communication plan to advise occupants of potential flood risks, the opportunity to purchase flood insurance, and the consequences of failure to purchase insurance. Exempts a geographic area if the Director: (1) determines that the area is protected by a system that provides protection from the 1% annual chance flood; or (2) has suspended the updating of flood plain areas or flood risk zones in such area in accordance with this Act for seven consecutive years.</summary>
