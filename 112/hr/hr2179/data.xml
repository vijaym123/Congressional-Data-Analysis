  <summary>5/8/2012--Reported to House amended.
Directs the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration [TSA] ) to transfer annually, without further appropriation, unclaimed money recovered at airport security checkpoints to United Service Organizations (USO), Incorporated, for funding its activities in support of USO airport centers. (Currently, such moneys are retained by the TSA for civil aviation security.) Directs the Assistant Secretary to transfer unclaimed clothing recovered at airport security checkpoints to local veterans organizations or other local charitable organizations for distribution to homeless or needy veterans and their families. Amends the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2005 to repeal the requirement that the TSA Administrator report annually to Congress on the total amount of unclaimed money recovered at each airport and on how it is being used to provide civil aviation security.</summary>
