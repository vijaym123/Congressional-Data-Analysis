  <summary>2/1/2012--Public Law.
SOAR Technical Corrections Act - Amends the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act to make technical corrections to the opportunity scholarship program that provides private school choice opportunities to disadvantaged students in the District of Columbia. Limits the requirement that core subject teachers at participating schools have a baccalaureate or equivalent degree to those core subject teachers teaching participating students. Directs the Institute of Education Sciences to administer nationally norm-referenced standardized tests to students participating in that evaluation, except where the school the student attends administers the same test. Requires participating schools that administer the test to provide the Secretary of Education with the test results for participating students.</summary>
