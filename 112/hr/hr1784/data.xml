  <summary>5/5/2011--Introduced.
Mammogram and MRI Availability Act of 2011 - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require a group or individual health plan that provides coverage for diagnostic mammography for any woman 40 years old or older to provide no less favorable coverage for annual screening mammography for such a woman, and diagnostic mammography, annual screening mammography, and annual magnetic resonance imaging for any high risk woman. Prohibits a health plan from denying enrollment or renewal solely to avoid the requirements of this Act, providing monetary incentives to encourage women to accept less than such minimum protections, penalizing providers for providing care in accordance with this Act, or providing incentives to induce providers to provide care in a manner inconsistent with this Act.</summary>
