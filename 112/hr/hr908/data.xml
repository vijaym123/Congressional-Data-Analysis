  <summary>9/19/2011--Reported to House amended.
Full Implementation of the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Act - Amends the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 to extend until October 4, 2018, the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to issue interim final regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for security of chemical facilities and requiring vulnerability assessments and the development and implementation of site security plans for such facilities. Exempts an individual holding a valid transportation security card from a security background check under such standards. Directs the Secretary to determine, on an ongoing basis, whether alternate security background checks conducted by the Secretary are sufficient to meet the requirements of such standards. Allows the owner or operator of a chemical facility subject to such regulations to permit an individual holding a valid transportation security card or who has passed a qualifying alternate security background check to have access to restricted areas or critical assets of such facility without the satisfaction of any other additional requirements imposed by the Secretary.</summary>
