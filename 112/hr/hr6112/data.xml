  <summary>7/12/2012--Introduced.
Employee Verification Act - Amends the the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to require federal contractors and subcontractors to participate in the E-Verify Program. Exempts specified federal procurement contracts from E-Verify coverage. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that E-Verify is applied to: (1) all persons hired during the term of the grant, loan, loan guarantee, or cooperative agreement by the recipient of the federal benefit to perform employment duties within the United States; and (2) all employees assigned by the recipient of the federal benefit to perform work within the United States under the project or activity funded by the grant, loan, loan guarantee, or cooperative agreement. Makes E-Verify permanent.</summary>
