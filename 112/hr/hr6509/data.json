Requires the regulation to: (1) apply the minimum quantity to rice and rice products regardless of the origin of the arsenic, (2) include the establishment of tolerances, and (3) establish a standard for total arsenic based on the maximum achievable reduction in cancer risk and be at least as protective as the allowable level set for total arsenic in bottled water under the Act."
