    "text": "Fairness to Pet Owners Act of 2011 - Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to promulgate rules relating to veterinary prescriptions, including rules requiring the prescriber of an animal drug to: (1)\u00a0 provide the pet owner a copy of the veterinary prescription and a written disclosure that the pet owner may fill the prescription through the prescriber (if available) or through another pharmacy determined by the pet owner; and (2) provide or verify the prescription by electronic or other means consistent with applicable state law, if requested by any person designated to act on behalf of the pet owner. Prohibits the prescriber of an animal drug from setting conditions on providing a copy of the prescription or verifying such prescription by: (1) requiring the purchase of the drug from the prescriber or from another person; (2) requiring payment in addition to, or as part of, the fee for an examination and evaluation; or (3) requiring the pet owner to sign a waiver or disclaim liability of the prescriber for the accuracy of the veterinary prescription, or delivering to the pet owner a notice waiving or disclaiming such liability. \u00a0 Permits the prescriber to require payment of fees for an examination and evaluation before providing a veterinary prescription, but only if the prescriber requires immediate payment in the case of an examination that reveals no requirement for an animal drug."
