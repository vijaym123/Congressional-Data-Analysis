    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on July 18, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 - Title I: Health Care Matters - Janey Ensminger Act - (Sec. 102) Makes any veteran who served on active duty at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, for at least 30 days between January 1, 1957, and December 31, 1987, and their family members, eligible for hospital care and medical services through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for any of 15 listed cancers and other illnesses or conditions, notwithstanding insufficient medical evidence to conclude that the illness or condition is attributable to such service. Makes the provision of such care and services for family members dependent on available appropriations. Prohibits such care and services for any illness or condition found to have resulted from a cause other than the residence of the family member. Requires family members to first exhaust all possible claims and remedies against a third party before the VA provision of such care and services. Requires an annual report in each of 2013 through 2015, from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) to the congressional veterans committees, on care and services so provided. (Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretary to waive the imposition or collection of copayments for telehealth and telemedicine visits of veterans. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to commence a three-year initiative to assess the feasibility and advisability of paying expenses or allowances for a veteran's round trip between an area designated as highly rural and the nearest Vet Center. Requires an initiative report from the Secretary to Congress. (Sec. 105) Requires VA payments to state nursing homes for care provided to veterans to be based on a methodology which reimburses such home for care provided under contract. (Under current law, such payments are made according to a prescribed rate.) Includes entities eligible to enter into such contracts as authorized VA nursing home, adult day health care, or other extended care providers. (Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary to develop and implement, by the end of FY2012, a centralized and comprehensive policy on reporting and tracking sexual assaults and other safety incidents at each VA medical facility, including: (1) risk-assessment tools; (2) mandatory security training; (3) physical security precautions (surveillance camera systems and panic alarm systems); (4) criteria and guidance for employees communicating and reporting incidents to specified supervisory personnel, VA law enforcement officials, and the Office of Inspector General; (5) an oversight system within the Veterans Health Administration; (6) procedures for VA law enforcement officials investigating, tracking, and closing reported incidents; and (7) clinical guidance for treating sexual assaults reported over 72 hours afterwards. Requires the Secretary to submit an interim and annual report to the veterans committees on such policy implementation. (Sec. 107) Includes the goal of maximizing the individual's independence within an individualized plan for the rehabilitation of veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Includes within plan objectives the sustaining of improvement in cognitive, behavioral, and vocational functioning. Includes within the VA definition of \"rehabilitative services\" treatment and services to sustain and prevent loss of functional gains, as well as any other services or supports that may contribute to maximizing an individual's independence.
