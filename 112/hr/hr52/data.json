Defines \"offshore drilling activity\" as drilling for oil or gas under a lease, or conducting a major geophysical seismic survey, under such Act, including for exploration, development, or production of oil or gas. Repeals a provision requiring the Secretary of the Interior to approve a plan for geological and geophysical exploration in the outer Continental Shelf within 30 days of its submission."
