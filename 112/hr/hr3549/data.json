Exempts from such requirement any financial interests in or income derived from: (1) the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), including the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP); (2) any other federal retirement system for U.S. officers and employees, including the President, or for members of the uniformed services; or (3) benefits received under the Social Security Act. Requires new Members to comply with this Act within 30 days after taking office, and incumbent Members within 30 days after enactment of this Act. Allows a Member to file, as appropriate, with the Clerk of the House of Representative or the Secretary of the Senate for an additional 30-day extension in order to comply. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action against any Member of Congress for noncompliance."
