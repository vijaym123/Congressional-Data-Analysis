    "text": "Competitive Justice Training Act of 2011 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) deviating from the competitive open grant process for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program (ICAC Program) training and establishing arbitrary limitations on the amount of such training provided by certain providers is anti-competitive and does not result in maximizing taxpayer value, training participation, or program quality or reducing associated overhead costs; and (2) the Attorney General should administer ICAC Program training grants without arbitrary statutory or regulatory limitations and should prioritize cost, quality, and proven training results. Amends the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008 to repeal the provision prohibiting the Attorney General from awarding any one entity other than a law enforcement agency more than $2 million annually to establish and conduct training courses for ICAC task force members and other law enforcement officials."
