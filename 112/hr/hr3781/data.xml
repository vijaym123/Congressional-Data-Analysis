  <summary>1/18/2012--Introduced.
Law Enforcement Torture Prevention Act of 2011 - Amends the federal criminal code to impose a prison term of up to 10 years on any person who, acting under color of law, commits, or attempts or conspires to commit, torture. Increases such prison term to any term of years or life if death results from such torture. Defines "torture" to mean intentionally inflicting severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, on a person for such purposes as obtaining from that person or another person information or a confession, punishing that person, or intimidating or coercing that person or another person, or for any reason based on discrimination, but does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to lawful sanctions.</summary>
