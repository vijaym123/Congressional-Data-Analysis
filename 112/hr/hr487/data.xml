  <summary>1/26/2011--Introduced.
Manufacture Renewable Energy Systems: Make it in America Act of 2011- Authorizes federal acquisition of, or the provision of federal funds to states for purchase of, only green technologies that are 100% manufactured in the United States from articles, materials, or supplies that are 100% grown, produced, or manufactured in the United States beginning in the fourth fiscal year after enactment of this Act. Provides that such percentage shall be 30% in the first fiscal year after enactment, 50% in the second fiscal year, and 80% in the third fiscal year. Defines "green technologies" to mean renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services that: (1) reduce dependence on unreliable sources of energy by encouraging the use of sustainable biomass, wind, small-scale hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services, and (2) use hybrid fossil-renewable energy systems. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit treating any facility originally placed in service after the enactment of this Act as a qualified facility for purposes of the renewable energy production and investment tax credits unless such facility is 100% manufactured in the United States from articles, materials, or supplies that are 100% grown, produced, or manufactured in the United States. Provides that such percentage shall be 30% for a facility placed in service during 2011, 50% for a facility placed in service during 2012, and 80% for a facility placed in service during 2013.</summary>
