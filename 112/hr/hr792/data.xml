  <summary>2/17/2011--Introduced.
Residential and Commuter Toll Fairness Act of 2011 - Grants a public authority the authority to carry out a program that offers discounts in transportation tolls to individuals who are residents of, or regular commuters to, a U.S. locality on an island, peninsula, or other area where transportation access is substantially constrained by geography and subject to a transportation toll to access or depart the locality (captive tollpayers). Declares that nothing in this Act may be construed to: (1) limit any other authority of a public authority, including the authority to offer discounts in transportation tolls to other tollpayers; or (2) affect, alter, or limit the applicability of state or local law with respect to the authority of a public authority to impose toll discounts.</summary>
