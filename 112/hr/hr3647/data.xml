Keep Americans Working Building Our Transportation Infrastructure Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to publish on the Internet any request for a waiver of Buy American requirements under the highway, public transportation, aviation, or passenger rail programs and provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the intent to issue a waiver. Requires the Secretary, upon deciding to grant such a waiver, to: (1) publish in the Federal Register, before the decision takes effect, a detailed written justification of the waiver; (2) provide the public with notice of the decision and an opportunity to comment on it for a reasonable period, but no less than 15 days; and (3) review those comments. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate or modify a waiver decision based on comments received after the decision takes effect. Repeals existing Buy American waiver requirements under the SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act of 2008 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010.</summary>
