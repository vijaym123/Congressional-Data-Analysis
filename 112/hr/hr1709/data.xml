Force Protection and Readiness Act - Grants, in cases arising under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for communications made between an alleged victim of sexual assault and a Sexual Assault Victim Advocate of the Department of Defense (DOD), to an individual who consulted with such an Advocate, a victim service organization, or a health care professional the privilege of refusing to disclose a confidential communication made by the individual if such communication was made for the purpose of securing advice, counseling, treatment, or assistance in connection with a sexual assault or other sexual misconduct. Allows the privilege to be claimed by the individual's guardian or conservator. Provides exceptions. Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to provide for the expedited consideration of a request for a permanent change of military station or unit transfer submitted by a member of the Armed Forces serving on active duty who was a victim of sexual assault or other sexual offense. Codifies under federal law a required information database on sexual assault incidents involving members of the Armed Forces. Repeals a superseded requirement under the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a universal hotline to facilitate the reporting of sexual assault involving members of the Armed Forces. Requires: (1) at least one full-time Sexual Assault Victim Advocate to be assigned to each battalion or equivalent military unit, and (2) appropriate training and certification of such advocates. Requires a copy of the record of proceedings of a court-martial involving a sexual assault or other sexual offense to be given to the victim if the victim testified during the proceedings. Directs the Secretary to provide a training module for judge advocates who serve as trial counsel to improve their ability to investigate and prosecute cases involving a sexual assault or other sexual offense.</summary>
