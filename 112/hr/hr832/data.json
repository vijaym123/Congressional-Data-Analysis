Directs the Secretary to appoint the Gulf Coast Health Research Advisory Committee in order to: (1) offer high-quality scientific research advice to the program established under this Act, including proactive advice regarding each federal agency's long-term monitoring and research objectives relating to workers and vulnerable residents at risk from the Deepwater Horizon disaster and other oil spills; and (2) provide a forum for ensuring that health concerns of workers and the public are considered in determining the priorities for scientific research. Requires the Secretary to ensure that members of the Advisory Committee do not have any conflicts of interest. Requires the Advisory Committee to: (1) provide advice on the development and implementation of the health research program; (2) respond to requests for advice from the appropriate federal official on matters within the Advisory Committee's expertise; and (3) as appropriate, review reports or other documents submitted to the appropriate federal officials pursuant to this Act to obtain information on protecting the health and safety of cleanup workers and vulnerable communities. Authorizes the Secretary to compel BP PLC to provide health-related data and information collected by or on behalf of BP PLC, except to the extent such data or information is protected from disclosure under federal law."
