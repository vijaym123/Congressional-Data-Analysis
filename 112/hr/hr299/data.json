Restores provisions of law amended by such Acts. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow the tax deduction for medical expenses without the gross income percentage limitation. Amends the Public Health Service Act to: (1) authorize appropriations for FY2011-FY2015 for grants to states for the creation and operation of qualified high risk health insurance pools; and (2) provide that the laws of the state designated by a health insurance issuer (primary state) shall apply to individual health insurance coverage offered by that issuer in the primary state and in any other state (secondary state), but only if the coverage and issuer comply with the conditions of this Act. Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide for establishment and governance of association health plans (AHPs), which are privately-sponsored group health plans that meet certain ERISA certification requirements. Establishes the Association Health Plan Fund to be used by the Secretary of Labor to make payments to an insurer to maintain coverage for a plan if there is a reasonable expectation that, without such payments, claims would not be satisfied by reason of termination of coverage. Allows a state to impose a contribution tax on an association health plan that commences operations in such state after the enactment of this Act."
