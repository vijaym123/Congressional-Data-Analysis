  <summary>10/6/2011--Introduced.
Clean Construction Act of 2011 - Requires all off-road diesel equipment and on-road diesel equipment operating for at least 80 hours over the life of a federal-aid highway construction project or public transportation construction project within a PM2.5 nonattainment or maintenance area to have diesel emission control technology installed. Applies the same requirement to all covered equipment used on a covered public transportation construction project within a PM2.5 nonattainment or maintenance area. Defines: (1) "off-road diesel equipment" as a vehicle (including covered equipment) that is powered by a nonroad diesel engine of at least 50 horsepower and not intended for highway use; and (2) "on-road diesel equipment" as any self-propelled vehicle that operates on diesel fuel, is designed to transport persons or property on a street or highway, and has a gross vehicle weight of at least 14,000 pounds. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to approve as part of the federal share of cost of a federal-aid highway construction project or public transportation construction project an amount equal to the state expenditure for acquiring and installing diesel emission control technology, if the state expenditure meets certain criteria. Directs the Secretary and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator to establish jointly a streamlined process to ensure that states may: (1) quantify the emissions reductions achieved under this Act; and (2) include such reductions in state implementation plans for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards under the Clean Air Act to demonstrate progress toward, attainment of, or maintenance of such standards.</summary>
