Authorizes a mortgage originator, when requested by a borrower as the originator is producing a mortgage, to forfeit or contribute toward bona fide third party expenses or origination fees up to 30% of earned compensation to avoid making a high-cost mortgage to a consumer, to make technical corrections, or for any other reason that results in a lower cost to the consumer than if such forfeiture or contribution did not take place."
