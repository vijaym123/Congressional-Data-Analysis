  <summary>8/16/2011--Introduced.
Revises the federal judicial code to remove provisions: (1) exempting any U.S. attorney or assistant U.S. attorney appointed for the Northern Mariana Islands who at the same time is serving in the same capacity in another district from the requirement that such attorney reside in the district for which he or she was appointed, and (2) allowing any U.S. marshal appointed for the Northern Mariana Islands to serve as marshal in another judicial district at the same time. Requires each U.S. marshal for the Northern Mariana Islands to reside within such district.</summary>
