  <summary>10/25/2011--Introduced.
Strengthening Community Safety Act of 2011 - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to authorize the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make a grant to an eligible first responder agency for the additional costs incurred as a direct result of one or more of its employees who are reservists being placed on active duty. Defines "eligible first responder agency" as one for which the cost of personnel has increased by not less than 5% as a direct result of such employees being placed on active duty and which is not a for-profit organization. Prohibits the Administrator from making a grant for costs relating to an employee being placed on active duty if federal funds are used for that employee's pay or benefits. Limits the total amount of grants made to an eligible first responder agency in any fiscal year to $100,000. Terminates the Administrator's authority to make grants three years after this Act's enactment. Authorizes the use of grant funds for: (1) pay or benefits for an individual hired to replace such an employee that are in addition to any pay and benefits that would have been provided to the deployed employee, (2) overtime expenses for an individual who performs tasks that would have been performed by such an employee, and (3) the costs associated with filling a vacancy created by an employee being placed on active duty. Allows a&#160;recipient to use grant funds to cover expenses incurred beginning 90 days before deployment until the date the employee returns to fully paid employment status. Amends the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to reduce funding for FY2011 for grants to private operators providing transportation by an over-the-road bus for security improvements.</summary>
