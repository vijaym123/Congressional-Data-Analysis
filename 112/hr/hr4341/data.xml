  <summary>3/29/2012--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress, among other things, that: (1) children of members of the Armed Forces deserve health-care practices and policies that are designed to meet their pediatric-specific needs and ensure and maintain their access to pediatric-specific treatment, providers, and facilities; and (2) the TRICARE program (a Department of Defense [DOD] managed health care program) should meet the needs of such children, including those with special needs and chronic conditions. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a working group to review the TRICARE program and make appropriate recommendations with respect to pediatric-specific health care and health care settings. Requires an initial and final report from the working group to the congressional defense and appropriations committees.</summary>
