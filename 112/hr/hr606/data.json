Requires that all federal programs the Commission recommends for abolishment be abolished, unless reauthorized by Congress. Requires the Comptroller General and the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in consultation with the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS), to prepare an annual inventory of programs within each federal agency to advise and assist Congress and the Commission in carrying out this Act."
