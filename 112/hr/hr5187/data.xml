Increases or extends tax credits for qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles, heavy natural gas vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicle refueling property. Provides for tax-exempt financing of electric, natural gas, and hydrogen vehicle refueling property. Limits or repeals tax incentives for major integrated oil companies, including: (1) the use of last-in, first-out accounting (LIFO); (2) the foreign tax credit for such companies that are dual capacity taxpayers; (3) the tax deduction for income attributable to the domestic production of oil, natural gas, or primary products thereof; (4) the tax deduction for intangible drilling and development costs; (5) percentage depletion for oil and gas wells; and (6) the tax deduction for tertiary injectant expenditures.</summary>
