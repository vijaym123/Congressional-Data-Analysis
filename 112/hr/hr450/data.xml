Restoring Assistance for Families' and Seniors' Health Expenses Act of 2011- Repeals provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) that: (1) increase from 7.5% to 10% the adjusted gross income threshold for claiming the tax deduction for medical expenses; (2) restrict payments from health savings accounts, medical savings accounts, and health flexible spending arrangements for medications solely to prescription drugs or insulin; (3) increase to 20% the penalty for distributions from a health savings or Archer medical savings account not used for qualified medical expenses; and (4) limit to $2,500 the annual salary reduction contribution to a health flexible spending arrangement under a cafeteria plan.
