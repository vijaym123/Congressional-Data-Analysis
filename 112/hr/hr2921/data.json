Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish a program to provide technical business assistance to small businesses no longer eligible to participate in federal procurement contracts through the SBA, such assistance to be provided for the two-year period following such eligibility. Increases from 5% to 8% annually the goal of federal procurement contracts let to small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Requires the Comptroller General to study, and report to Congress on, the activities of the five most and least successful federal agencies with respect to meeting small business federal procurement contracting goals."
