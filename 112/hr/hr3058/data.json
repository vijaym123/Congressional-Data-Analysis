Prohibits such threshold from exceeding $15,000 in any such deviation. Defines \"domestic emergency operation\" to mean assistance activities carried out in support of: (1) an emergency or major disaster as defined in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; (2) any occasion for which the Secretary determines federal assistance is needed to supplement state and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the United States; or (3) any natural catastrophe or fire, flood, or explosion in the United States that causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance to supplement the efforts and resources of states, local governments, and disaster relief organizations."
