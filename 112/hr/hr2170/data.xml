  <summary>10/14/2011--Reported to House amended.
Cutting Federal Red Tape to Facilitate Renewable Energy Act - Requires federal agencies, in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) with respect to: (1) any action authorizing or facilitating a proposed renewable energy project, to consider and analyze at the election of the applicant only the proposed action alternative and the no action alternative and to identify and analyze potential mitigation measures only for such alternatives; and (2) a proposed renewable energy project, to only consider public comments that specifically address such alternatives and that are filed within 30 days after publication of a draft environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. Defines a "renewable energy project" as a project on federal lands or in federal waters, including a project on the Outer Continental Shelf, using wind, solar power, geothermal power, biomass, or marine and hydrokinetic energy to generate energy, that is constructed encouraging the use of equipment and materials manufactured in the United States.</summary>
