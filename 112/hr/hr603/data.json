Requires ITPs to assist the developmentally disabled achieve integrated employment, postsecondary education, independent living, and community engagement. Requires each grantee to establish a transition planning and services (TPS) administrative unit within its intellectual and developmental disabilities agency to develop, and assist in the implementation of, ITPs. Requires that unit to offer strategies, training, and information to the developmentally disabled and their families that facilitates their participation in the transition process. States that ITPs are to: (1) apply until an individual's 26th birthday; (2) be reviewed annually and updated as needed; (3) be developed during in-person meetings that include the individual and his or her family; and (4) address the individual's needs in the areas of postsecondary education, career preparation and work-based learning, development and leadership, connecting activities, and family involvement and supports. Requires the TPS administrative unit to use transition brokers to: (1) facilitate coordination among state agencies in the development of ITPs; and (2) assist the developmentally disabled, consistent with their ITPs, in navigating the complex system of supports and services available through federal and state programs."
