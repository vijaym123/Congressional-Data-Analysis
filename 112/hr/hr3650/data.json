    "text": "Federal Zero Tolerance of Child Sexual Abuse Act of 2011 - Prohibits the provision of federal funding to nonprofit organizations that deal with children and to institutions of higher education if the Attorney General determines that an officer or employee of such entity has failed to report known or suspected incidents of child sexual abuse to law enforcement. Excepts federal student financial aid from that prohibition. Sets the duration of the funding prohibition at from one to five years. Allows the Attorney General to reduce the duration of the prohibition or eliminate it altogether if there is good cause for taking such action and the nonprofit organization or school is enforcing policies to comply with this Act's reporting requirements. Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to require states receiving grants for child abuse or neglect prevention and treatment to require individuals employed in any position that involves direct contact with children to report known and suspected instances of child abuse and neglect."
