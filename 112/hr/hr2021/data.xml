  <summary>6/22/2011--Passed House without amendment.
Jobs and Energy Permitting Act of 2011 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require any air quality impact of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) sources to be measured or modeled and determined solely with respect to the impacts in the corresponding onshore area. Provides that: (1) emissions from any vessel servicing or associated with an OCS source, including emissions while at the OCS source or in route to or from the OCS source within 25 miles of the OCS source, shall be considered direct emissions from the OCS source (current law) but shall not be subject to any emission control requirement applicable to such source; and (2) an OCS source, for platform or drill ship exploration, is established when drilling commences at a location and ceases to exist when drilling activity ends at such location or is temporarily interrupted because the platform or drill ship relocates. Requires: (1) final agency action on a permit application for platform or drill ship exploration for an OCS source under such Act to be taken no later than six months after the filing of&#160;such&#160; application;&#160;(2) such final agency action to be considered to be nationally applicable under judicial review; and (3) judicial review of such action to be without additional administrative review or adjudication. Prohibits: (1) the Environmental Appeals Board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from having any authority to consider any matter regarding the consideration, issuance, or denial of such permit;&#160; and (2) extending any administrative stay of the effectiveness of such permit beyond six months after the date of filing of such application.</summary>
