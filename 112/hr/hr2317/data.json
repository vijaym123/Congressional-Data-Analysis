    "text": "Promoting Green Transportation Infrastructure through Research and Development Act - Moves the Office of Climate Change and Environment into the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and requires it to coordinate research, development, and technology transfer activities: (1) that focus on transportation-related emissions and energy reduction strategies, and (2) on the impacts of climate change on surface transportation infrastructure. Revises the surface transportation, research, development, and technology program to direct the Administrator of RITA to make grants to institutions of higher education (including consortia) to establish regional university transportation centers (UTCs) to carry out research, development, and technology transfer activities in the field of green transportation infrastructure (i.e., infrastructure that preserves and restores natural processes, utilizes natural design techniques, and minimizes energy consumption and pollution). Directs the Administrator to establish a pavement research, deployment, and education program."
