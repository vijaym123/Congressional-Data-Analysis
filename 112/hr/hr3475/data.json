Revises the Commissioner's authority to use or provide for the use of records corrected in reliance on such information for statistical and research activities conducted by federal and state agencies. Adds to such uses federal law enforcement and tax administration activities as well as statistical and research activities conducted by state agencies. Declares that any information related to a deceased person received by the Commissioner other than under a contract with a state shall be treated, with respect to protection from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, in the same manner as information received from a state pursuant to a voluntary contract. Prohibits the use of such information for any purpose other than for correction of OASDI program information."
