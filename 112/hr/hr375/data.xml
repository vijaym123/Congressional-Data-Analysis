  <summary>1/20/2011--Introduced.
Fix United States Government Contracting Deficit with China Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to certify annually to Congress: (1) a determination of whether the Chinese government has prohibited its procurement of U.S. goods during the preceding calendar year; and (2) the total value of U.S. goods procured by the Chinesse government during that year, if the Chinese government has not prohibited such procurement. Prohibits the head of each executive agency from awarding a contract for the procurement of Chinese goods during the succeeding calendar year if the Chinese government has prohibited procurement of U.S. goods during the preceding calendar year. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT), in such an instance, to prohibit a state or other entity from using funds made available to it from the Highway Trust Fund or the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for the award of a contract for the procurement of Chinese goods during the succeeding calendar year. Limits the total value of Chinese goods that may be procured by the U.S. government during the succeeding calendar year to the total value of U.S. goods procured by the Chinese Government during the preceding calendar year, if in fact the Chinese government has not prohibited its procurement of U.S. goods during that preceding calendar year. Directs the International Trade Administration to establish a program to: (1) identify annually the total value of U.S. goods procured by the Chinese government; and (2) provide notice in the Federal Register on or as soon as practicable after the date on which the total value of Chinese goods procured by the U.S. government equals 50%, 75%, and 100% of the total value of U.S. goods procured by the Chinese government during the preceding calendar year, for purposes of compliance with the limitation required by this Act.</summary>
