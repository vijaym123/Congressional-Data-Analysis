Requires that the program: (1) be similar in structure to the Lifeline program for basic telephone service, (2) prevent awarding duplicative subsidies for an individual eligible household, and (3) promote competition from broadband service providers by using neutral technology. Requires a broadband service provider that is not an eligible telecommunications carrier to obtain FCC authorization to participate in the program."
