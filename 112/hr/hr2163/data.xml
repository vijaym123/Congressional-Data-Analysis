  <summary>6/14/2011--Introduced.
Broadband Affordability Act of 2011 - Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a broadband lifeline program enabling qualifying low-income customers residing in urban and rural areas to purchase broadband service at reduced charges by reimbursing providers for each such customer served. Requires that the program: (1) be similar in structure to the Lifeline program for basic telephone service, (2) prevent awarding duplicative subsidies for an individual eligible household, and (3) promote competition from broadband service providers by using neutral technology. Requires a broadband service provider that is not an eligible telecommunications carrier to obtain FCC authorization to participate in the program.</summary>
