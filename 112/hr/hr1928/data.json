    "text": "Women's Fair and Equal Right to Military Service Act - Requires the Secretary of Defense to revise the military personnel policies of the Department of Defense (DOD) and the military departments so that such policies do not restrict members of the Armed Forces from assignment to units and positions based on gender. Prohibits any change in a military personnel policy that would exclude based on gender from taking effect until: (1) the Secretary submits to Congress a notice of the intent to make the change, and (2) the expiration of 30 legislative days after Congress receives such notice. Repeals specified existing Armed Forces personnel laws directing the Secretary to notify Congress of changes to the ground combat exclusion policy (defined in the existing provisions as military personnel policies of DOD and military departments, as in effect on October 1, 1994, by which female members of the armed forces are restricted from assignment to units and positions below brigade level whose primary mission is to engage in direct combat on the ground), assignment of females to certain military career designators, and other related personnel policy changes."
