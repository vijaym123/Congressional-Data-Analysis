Allows transfers of such entitlements by individuals honorably discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces due to a service-connected disability or after sustaining an injury in line of duty requiring hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care or treatment. (Current law requires an individual to be serving as a member of the Armed Forces when the transfer is executed.) Sets forth extended and alternative eligibility periods for such individuals. Applies this Act to individuals who become eligible to transfer such benefits on or after August 1, 2009."
