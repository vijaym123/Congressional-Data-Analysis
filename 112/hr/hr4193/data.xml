  <summary>3/8/2012--Introduced.
Land Acquisition to cut National Debt Act or LAND Act - Bars the Secretary of the Interior from using federal funding to purchase land resulting in a net increase of land acreage being under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), or the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) unless the federal budget is balanced for the year in which such land would be purchased. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to lands purchased with funding made available through the sale of Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamps. Bars the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) from using federal funding to purchase land resulting in a net increase of land acreage included in the National Forest System unless the federal budget is balanced for the year in which that land would be purchased.</summary>
