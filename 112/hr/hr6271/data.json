Imposes an additional estate tax if, within 10 years after the decedent's death and before the date of the qualified heir's death: (1) qualified farmland ceases to be used for farming purposes or is sold outside of the qualified heir's family; or (2) material participation requirements for a qualified family-owned business interest are not met, the business ceases to be located in the United States, or the business is sold outside the qualified heir's family. Makes permanent estate tax provisions of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010."
