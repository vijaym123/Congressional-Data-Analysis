  <summary>6/21/2012--Introduced.
Amends the federal criminal code to exempt the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) from disclosure of confidential information violations when the Secretary shares certain information and materials with intellectual property rights owners for purposes of determining whether semiconductor chip products are being imported into the United States in violation of Lanham Act provisions that prohibit infringing trademarks on imported articles or in violation of any of the exclusive rights of the owner of a mask work under the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984. Authorizes the Secretary, upon presentation of such products, to: (1) share with the holder of the registered mark or the owner of the mask work information on the semiconductor chip products and their packaging and labels, including unredacted photographs or digital images of such products, packaging, and labels; and (2) supply unredacted samples of such products to such holder of the registered mark or owner of the mask work at any time, subject to bonding requirements. Requires the Secretary, upon detention of such products, to share such product information and unredacted photographs or images with the registered mark holder or mask work owner. Sets forth exceptions for cases that would compromise ongoing law enforcement investigations or national security.</summary>
