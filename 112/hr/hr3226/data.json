Modifies for FY2011-FY2012 the formula for the pro rata reduction credit in the calculation of the minimum participation rate of all families of a state receiving TANF assistance for any reduction in such rate owing to caseload reductions not required by federal law and not resulting from changes in state eligibility criteria."
