Electronic Paycard Protection Act of 2011 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1933 to require an employer who pays or wishes to pay an employee by means of an electronic payroll card to provide certain disclosures to the employee at the time he or she is provided the option to enroll in the electronic payroll card program. Includes among such disclosures, in addition to all terms and conditions governing the card's use, that: (1) the employee has the ability to access his or her wages as well as electronically check the available balance through use of the card, (2) no fees may be assessed to the employee for ordinary card use, (3) the employer shall maintain payroll funds accessible by means of the card only in an insured depository institution or an insured credit union, (4) the employer shall offer the employee the option of wage payment through direct deposit to the employee's checking or savings account, and (6) the employee may not be terminated for opting not to participate in the program. Makes it unlawful for any person to violate the requirements of this Act.</summary>
