Requires LEA grant applicants to demonstrate that for each of their schools that are to use the nebulizers: (1) a full-time certified nurse is on staff; (2) trained personnel and other resources necessary for nebulizer use are in place; (3) emergency services personnel are notified of nebulizer locations; (4) nebulizers are integrated into the school's emergency response procedures; and (5) procedures are in place to notify parents of the availability of nebulizers, and inform them how to provide the school with their child's prescription asthma medication and authorization to use a nebulizer to assist their child. Gives grant priority to LEAs that: (1) serve areas where the prevalence of asthma is at least 10% higher than the national average; (2) do not already have at least one nebulizer in each of their schools; (3) serve schools that typically have a significant number of students, staff, and visitors present during the day; and (4) have not received funds under the Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act."
