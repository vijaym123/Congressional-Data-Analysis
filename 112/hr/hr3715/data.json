Requires such grants to be awarded on a competitive basis to educational institutions, community-based organizations, nonprofit organizations, state or local boards, or units of general local government that provide online workforce training. Directs the Secretary to award one grant to an eligible postsecondary educational institution to: (1) provide technical assistance to entities that receive grants, (2) collect and nationally disseminate the data gathered by entities that receive grants, and (3) disseminate best practices."
