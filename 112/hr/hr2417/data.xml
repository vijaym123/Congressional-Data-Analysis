  <summary>7/6/2011--Introduced.
Better Use of Light Bulbs Act - Repeals provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 concerning lighting energy efficiency, including provisions amending the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), that: (1) prescribe energy efficiency standards for general service incandescent lamps,&#160;rough service lamps, and other designated lamps; (2) direct the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to conduct and report to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on an annual assessment of the market for general service lamps and compact fluorescent lamps; (3) direct the Secretary to carry out a proactive national program of consumer awareness, information, and education about lamp labels and energy-efficient lighting choices; (4) prohibit a manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler from distributing in commerce specified adapters for incandescent lamps; (5) authorize the Secretary to carry out a lighting technology research and development program; and (6) set forth minimum energy efficiency standards for incandescent reflector lamps. Provides that EPCA shall be applied and administered as if such provisions had not been enacted. Provides that: (1)&#160;no federal, state, or local&#160;requirement or standard regarding energy efficient lighting&#160; shall be effective to the extent that the requirement or standard can be satisfied only by installing or using lamps containing mercury; and (2)&#160;no state or local regulation concerning the energy efficiency or energy use of medium screw base general service incandescent lamps shall be effective.</summary>
