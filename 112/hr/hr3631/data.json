Directs the Administrator to give priority to grant applications that best: (1) preserve capabilities needed to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk to the United States; (2) preserve core capabilities developed through previous UASI grant allocations; (3) align with strategies and principles of the National Preparedness Goal, including the promotion of national preparedness; and (4) support capabilities that enhance regional catastrophic planning that could be used nationally through mutual aid agreements. Prohibits any one applicant from receiving more than 7% of the total amount authorized for such grant program."
