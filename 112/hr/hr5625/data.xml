Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act - Authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to: (1) reinstate the license for either or each of the projects numbered 10822 and 10823, and (2) extend for two years after the date on which either or each such project is reinstated the time period during which the licensee must commence project construction. Directs FERC to: (1) transfer the reinstated licenses to the town of Canton, Connecticut, if it reinstates them and extends the time period during which the licensee is required to commence project construction; and (2) complete an environmental assessment for the projects and update the environmental analysis performed during the licensing process. Sets a deadline for FERC to: (1) reach a final decision concerning the projects, and (2) complete the license transfer if it decides to reinstate either or both licenses. Declares that this Act does not affect certain valid licenses issued by FERC before enactment of this Act or diminish or extinguish any existing rights under any such license.</summary>
