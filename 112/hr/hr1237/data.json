Requires, regarding the value of the Van Duzen and Sky Ranch parcels, that: (1) if such value is less than that of the land conveyed to the Utilities District any cash equalization payments received by the Secretaries shall be deposited in the Treasury, and (2) if such value is greater, no cash equalization payment may be made to the District and the acreage of the land involved may be adjusted to equalize the value of the exchange. Instructs that the exact acreage and legal description of the lands to be exchanged be determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary concerned. Makes the District responsible for the survey costs and reasonable administrative costs related to the exchange. Requires the land acquired by the USDA Secretary to be added to and administered as part of the Six Rivers National Forest and the land acquired by the Secretary of the Interior to be administered as public land by the Redding Field Office. Directs the USDA Secretary to complete the conveyance of the System land within one year of the date on which the District offers to make such conveyances."
