Instructs the Secretaries to work with stakeholders to identify problems that can be solved over a period of five years through the development of an advanced composite material. Requires such Centers, by working with the private sector, to strive to produce new composite materials that are lighter, stronger, and more durable than existing materials and that have an immediate practical application."
