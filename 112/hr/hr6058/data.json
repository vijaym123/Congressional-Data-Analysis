    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2012-06-28", 
    "text": "Temporary Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to reduce the amount apportioned for a surface transportation program, project, or activity for FY2012 by amounts apportioned or allocated under the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012 for the period from October 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012. Prescribes a special rule to provide that the amendments made by this Act shall cease to be effective upon enactment of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). Amends the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011, Part II to continue through July 15, 2012, and authorizes appropriations through that date for, specified federal-aid highway programs under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), the SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act of 2008, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. Includes among extended funds those for: (1) the surface transportation research, development, and deployment program; (2) training and education; (3) the Bureau of Transportation Statistics; (4) university transportation research; and (5) intelligent transportation systems (ITS) research. Subjects funding for such programs generally to the same manner of distribution, administration, limitation, and availability for obligation, however, at 289/366 of the total amount, as funds authorized to be appropriated for such programs and activities out of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) for FY2011. Subjects contract authority, however, between October 1, 2011, and July 15, 2012, for such programs to a specified pro rata limitation on obligations included in any Act making appropriations for FY2012 or a portion of that fiscal year. Waives this obligation limitation, though, for emergency relief and for the equity bonus program. Extends the allocation of certain transportation program funds to: (1) states for specific programs, including the Interstate and National Highway System program, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program, the highway safety improvement program, the Surface Transportation program, and the Highway Bridge program; and (2) the territories and Puerto Rico. Prohibits use of program funds for a high-speed MAGLEV system between Las Vegas, Nevada, and Anaheim, California. Authorizes appropriations from the HTF (other than the Mass Transit Account) for administrative expenses of the federal-aid highway program for the period from October 1, 2011, through July 15, 2012. Terminates the surface transportation project delivery pilot program on September 30, 2012. Amends SAFETEA-LU to extend, from October 1, 2011, through July 15, 2012, the authorization of appropriations for specified National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety programs (including NHTSA administrative expenses) and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) programs. Extends for the same period the funding for hazardous materials (hazmat) research projects. Amends the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act to continue, from October 1, 2011, through July 15, 2012, the authorized distribution of funds under such Act for coastal wetlands, recreational boating safety, projects under the Clean Vessel Act of 19921, boating infrastructure projects, and the National Outreach and Communications Program. Extends the set-aside for administrative expenses for carrying out such projects. Extends, from October 1, 2011, through July 15, 2012, the allocation of capital investment grant funds for federal transit programs, including the metropolitan planning program and the state planning and research program. Extends the special rule authority of the Secretary to award urbanized area formula grants to finance the operating cost of equipment and facilities for use in public transportation in an urbanized area with a population of at least 200,000. Allocates, from October 1, 2011, through July 15, 2012, certain amounts for formula and bus grants and capital investment grants for: (1) certain new fixed guideway capital projects; (2) new fixed guideway ferry systems and extension projects in Alaska and Hawaii; (3) payments to the Denali Commission for docks, waterfront development projects, and related transportation infrastructure; (4) ferry boats or ferry terminal facilities; (5) a set-aside for the national fuel cell bus technology development program; (6) projects in nonurbanized areas; (7) intermodal terminal projects; and (8) bus testing. Extends the apportionment of nonurbanized area formula grants for public transportation on Indian reservations. Extends, from October 1, 2011, through July 15, 2012, the apportionment of capital investment grant funds for certain fixed guideway modernization projects. Extends for that same period the authorization appropriations from the HTF Mass Transit Account for: (1) formula and bus grant projects, (2) capital investment grants, (3) transit research, and (4) administration expenses. Extends, from October 1, 2011, through July 15, 2012, certain SAFETEA-LU programs, including: (1) the contracted paratransit pilot program, (2) the public-private partnership pilot program, (3) project authorizations for final design and construction and preliminary engineering of specified fixed guideway projects, and (4) the elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities pilot program. Extends certain allocations for national research and technology programs."
