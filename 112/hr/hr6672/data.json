Authorizes the Secretary to review and revise such an authorization. Authorizes the Secretary to determine that a laboratory examination or procedure associated with a medical device subject to an authorization is deemed to be in a particular category of examinations and procedures if such categorization would be beneficial to protecting the public health and the benefits of the categorization outweigh the risks. Authorizes the Secretary to extend the expiration date of eligible medical countermeasures during an emergency if: (1) the extension is intended to support the U.S. ability to protect the public health or military preparedness and effectiveness, and (2) the extension is supported by an appropriate scientific evaluation that is conducted or accepted by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to permit deviations from good manufacturing practice requirements when the circumstances of a domestic, military, or public health emergency or material threat so warrant. Authorizes the Secretary to waive prescription requirements during an emergency and issue emergency use instructions to inform health care providers or individuals to whom an eligible product is to be administered concerning the product's approved, licensed, or cleared conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to waive requirements for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy in the event of a domestic, military, or public health emergency (currently, such waiver authority applies only to a public health emergency) or the identification of a material threat sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens abroad. Permits a government entity to introduce into interstate commerce a product intended for emergency use if that product is intended to be held and not used, and is held and not used, unless and until it is: (1) approved, cleared, or licensed; (2) authorized for investigational use; or (3) authorized for emergency use. (Sec. 304) Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure the appropriate involvement of FDA personnel in interagency activities related to countermeasure advanced research and development, (2) ensure the appropriate involvement and consultation of FDA personnel in flexible manufacturing activities, (3) promote countermeasure expertise within the FDA, and (4) maintain teams composed of FDA personnel with expertise on countermeasures. Requires the Secretary to provide final guidance to industry within one year after enactment of this Act regarding the development of animal models to support approval, clearance, or licensure of countermeasures and epidemic and pandemic products when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. Requires the Secretary to establish a procedure by which a sponsor or applicant that is developing a countermeasure for which human efficacy studies are not ethical or practicable, and that has an approved investigational new drug application or investigational device exemption, may request and receive: (1) a meeting to discuss proposed animal model development activities, and (2) a meeting prior to initiating pivotal animal studies. Requires such meetings to include discussion of animal models for pediatric populations, as appropriate. Requires the Secretary to take into account the material threat posed by the chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent for which the countermeasure under review is intended when evaluating a countermeasure for approval, licensure, or clearance. Declares that, when practicable and appropriate, teams of FDA personnel reviewing applications or submissions shall include a reviewer with sufficient training or experience with countermeasures pursuant to established protocols. (Sec. 305) Requires the Secretary to establish a formal process for obtaining scientific feedback and interactions regarding the development and regulatory review of eligible countermeasures by facilitating the development of written regulatory management plans. Allows a sponsor or applicant of an eligible countermeasure to initiate such process upon submission of a written request to the Secretary which includes a proposed regulatory management plan. Requires the FDA to work with the sponsor or applicant to agree on a regulatory management plan within 90 days. Sets forth the required contents for a regulatory management plan, which includes developmental milestones and performance targets and goals. Requires the Secretary to establish regulatory management plans for all security countermeasures for which a request is submitted. Allows the Director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to prioritize which other eligible countermeasures may receive regulatory management plans if the Secretary determines that resources are not available to establish regulatory management plans for all other eligible countermeasures. (Sec. 306) Directs the Secretary to report annually on the countermeasure development and review activities of the FDA, and make the report available on the FDA website. (Sec. 307) Requires the Secretary to solicit input from the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the Director of BARDA regarding pediatric studies for medical countermeasures. Requires the Secretary to notify the Assistant Secretary and the Director of BARDA of all pediatric studies in the written request for a pediatric study issued by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
