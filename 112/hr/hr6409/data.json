    "text": "Private Sector Whistleblower Protection Streamlining Act of 2012 - Sets forth whistleblower protections for private sector, state, and municipal employees who are retaliated or discriminated against by an employer for disclosing threats to public safety or violations of federal law. Authorizes a whistleblower who has been discharged or discriminated against by an employer to seek appropriate relief either by: (1) filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor; or (2) bringing an action at law or equity in the appropriate U.S. district court. Prohibits restrictions on whistleblowing and relief provided under this Act. Establishes the Whistleblower Protection Office in the Department of Labor. Makes conforming whistleblower amendments to the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, the federal criminal code with respect to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. Establishes in the Department of Labor an Administrative Review Board with jurisdiction and authority to decide appeals from administrative decisions and issue final agency decisions on behalf of the Secretary. Declares that this Board supersedes the one established by the Secretary pursuant to an administrative order."
