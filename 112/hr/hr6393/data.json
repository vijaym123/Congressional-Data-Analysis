Requires such determination to be made within 30 days following the request for such care or services. Amends the Wounded Warrior Act to authorize the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to allow any former member of the Armed Forces with a severe injury or illness to receive necessary medical and dental care in a non-VA facility when such care is determined by the member's physician to be in their best interest. Extends such authority through 2016."
