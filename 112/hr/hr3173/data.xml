  <summary>6/28/2012--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it is urgent that the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) application process be reformed by the end of 2012, (2) the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) should promulgate final regulations to require the deployment of TWIC readers as soon as practicable to ensure security, and (3) Port Security Grant Program funds for TWIC projects shall not expire before issuance of the final TWIC reader rule. Directs the Secretary to reform the process for the enrollment, activation, issuance, and renewal of a TWIC to require not more than one in-person visit to a designated enrollment center, except in cases in which there are extenuating circumstances requiring more than one such in-person visit.</summary>
