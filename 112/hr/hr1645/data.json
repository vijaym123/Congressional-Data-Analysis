    "text": "Vieques Recovery and Development Act of 2011 - Directs the President to acquire or convert real property located within the Municipality of Vieques, Puerto Rico, for the purpose of constructing: (1) a specialty hospital that provides treatment for the sick and injured; and (2) a toxins research center that studies the existence, prevalence, and impact of toxins in Vieques, provides recommendations regarding the prevention of exposure to harmful levels of such toxins, and shares findings with medical personnel at such hospital. Requires the President to: (1) operate and maintain the quality of the hospital and research center; (2) develop an interagency plan to ensure that such residents benefit from improved access to federal programs, federal discretionary funding sources, and federal agency technical assistance; and (3) appoint a federal ombudsman for Vieques, who shall monitor the development and implementation of such plan. Prohibits the President from carrying out this Act until the administrative claims filed on May 18, 2009, by the Mayor of Vieques for money damages against the Department of the Navy have been settled or compromised. Authorizes a $10,000 award for settlement of any personal injury claim filed before enactment of this Act by an individual who was a resident of Vieques during or after the Navy's use of chemical weapons, toxic chemicals, and heavy metals for military training operations on the island, including for illness or death arising from such use. Increases awards for individuals who submit medical documentation of contracting a disease that is life-threatening, chronic, or related to heavy metals toxicity. Deems any award payment to be full settlement of the claim and a complete release by the individual of such claim against the United States or its employees."
