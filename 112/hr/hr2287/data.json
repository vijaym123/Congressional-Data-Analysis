Specifies among such conditions that the President confers with the governments of Canada and Mexico and renegotiates NAFTA to correct: (1) trade deficits, (2) currency distortions, and (3) the impact of agricultural imports on U.S. production. Prescribes requirements also for: (1) gains in U.S. jobs and living standards, (2) increased domestic manufacturing, (3) health and environmental standards, (4) a non-increase in crime with illegal drugs, and (5) democracy and human freedoms. Expresses the sense of Congress that until such conditions are met: (1) the President should not engage in negotiations to expand NAFTA to include other countries, and (2) trade promotion authority should not be renewed with respect to approval of any such NAFTA expansion."
