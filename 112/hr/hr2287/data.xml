  <summary>6/22/2011--Introduced.
NAFTA Accountability Act - Provides that unless the specified conditions set forth in this Act are met: (1) Congress withdraws its approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) effective one year after enactment of this Act; and (2) the President, not later than 200 days after enactment of such Act, shall provide written notice of withdrawal to the governments of Canada and Mexico. Specifies among such conditions that the President confers with the governments of Canada and Mexico and renegotiates NAFTA to correct: (1) trade deficits, (2) currency distortions, and (3) the impact of agricultural imports on U.S. production. Prescribes requirements also for: (1) gains in U.S. jobs and living standards, (2) increased domestic manufacturing, (3) health and environmental standards, (4) a non-increase in crime with illegal drugs, and (5) democracy and human freedoms. Expresses the sense of Congress that until such conditions are met: (1) the President should not engage in negotiations to expand NAFTA to include other countries, and (2) trade promotion authority should not be renewed with respect to approval of any such NAFTA expansion.</summary>
