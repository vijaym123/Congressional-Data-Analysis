Provides for: (1) state regulation of gray wolves if the population meets or exceeds the applicable number for such state; or (2) treatment as an endangered or threatened species if the number of gray wolves is less than that number until the Secretary determines that the number of gray wolves in such state equals at least that number during two consecutive years. Defines \"gray wolf\" as any taxonomic group traditionally associated with the gray wolf, including Canus lupus, Canus lupus lycaon, and Canus lupus baileyi, regardless of specific taxonomy of any particular gray wolf variety as a species, subspecies, or other designation."
