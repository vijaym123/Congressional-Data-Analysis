Defines \"food of poor nutritional quality\" as food and beverages that are determined by the Secretary of the Treasury (in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services [HHS] and the Federal Trade Commission [FTC]) to be inconsistent with the most recent dietary guidelines published under the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act of 1990."
