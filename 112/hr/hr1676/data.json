Requires the Commissioner to: (1) complete a study on the adequacy of performance standards established for ultraviolet tanning lamps; and (2) either issue a rule providing for more stringent performance standards for such lamps, including with respect to the strength of ultraviolet rays emitted by such devices and the amount of time a user should remain exposed to such devices, or submit to Congress a report providing a justification for not issuing such a rule. Directs the Commissioner to carry out recommendations made in a report on labeling requirements for indoor tanning devices regarding ultraviolet tanning lamps. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commissioner with regard to an ultraviolet tanning lamp."
