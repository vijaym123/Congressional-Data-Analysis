HOPE VI Program Termination Act of 2011 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to repeal the authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide assistance to public housing agencies for demolition, site revitalization, replacement housing, and tenant-based assistance grants for projects (HOPE VI program). Rescinds and permanently cancels all unobligated balances remaining available under the Act for the program, and terminates it. Requires all such unobligated balances so rescinded and permanently canceled to be covered in the general fund of the Treasury for reducing the budget deficit of the federal government.</summary>
