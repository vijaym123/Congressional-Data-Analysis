  <summary>6/16/2011--Introduced.
Southern Border Sheriffs Community Impact Aid Act of 2011 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the federal government should offset the additional law enforcement costs on counties adjacent to the southern border of the United States in a manner similar to the Community Impact Aid program for local schools that incur additional costs from federal infrastructure. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to make grants to sheriffs' departments in specified Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California counties along the border for the purpose of hiring additional deputies in an amount equal to 30% of such a department's FY2010 budget for patrol deputies, or at least the amount that allows the deparment to hire one additional deputy. Directs the Secretary to reprogram funds that would otherwise be obligated and expended under the account heading "Departmental Management and Operations" in order to carry out this Act.</summary>
