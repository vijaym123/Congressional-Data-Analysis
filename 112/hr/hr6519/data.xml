  <summary>9/21/2012--Introduced.
Defend Your Home Against Wildfire Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary of the Interior to establish a process for the expedited consideration of a permit application submitted by the owner of eligible private property to remove vegetation on federal land adjacent to the property to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire that would threaten a residential structure on such property. Requires the final decision on an application for a vegetation removal permit to be made no later than 14 days after the application is received. Prohibits a vegetation removal permit from authorizing vegetation removal activities by a private landowner on federal land more than 100 feet beyond the boundary or boundaries shared by such land and the eligible private property. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to make a grant to a recipient of a vegetation removal permit to help cover up to 25% of the vegetation removal costs.</summary>
