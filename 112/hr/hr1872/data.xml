  <summary>5/12/2011--Introduced.
Employment Protection Act of 2011 - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), prior to issuing a regulation, policy statement, guidance, or other requirement, implementing any new or substantially altered program, or issuing or denying any permit, to analyze its impact on employment levels and economic activity, disaggregated by state. Requires such analysis to include estimated job losses and decreased economic activity due to the denial or issuance of permits, including permits issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act). Requires the Administrator to: (1) post such analysis on EPA's website and request governors of states experiencing more than a de minimis negative impact to post such analysis in their capitols; (2) hold public hearings in each state in which a requirement, program, or permit will have more than a de minimis negative impact; and (3) give notice of such impact in a state to such state's congressional delegation, governor, and legislature at least 45 days prior to the effective date of such requirement or program or the denial or issuance of a permit. Defines "de minimis negative impact" to mean: (1) with respect to employment levels, a loss of more than 100 jobs; and (2) with respect to economic activity, a decrease in economic activity of more than $1,000,000 over any calendar year.</summary>
