Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that at least 10% of the federal funds awarded after enactment of this Act for emergency management performance grants authorized by the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 be used to test or implement equipment or services allowing members of the public to send 9-1-1 text messages to obtain emergency assistance."
