  <summary>6/23/2011--Introduced.
Safe Drivers Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to study distracted driving, including cognitive distraction when driving and driver distraction impacts on young, inexperienced drivers. Requires the Secretary to withhold 25% of a state's apportionment of certain federal-aid highway program funds for the fiscal year if the state has not enacted or is not enforcing a law that: (1) prohibits, except in an emergency, an operator of a moving or idling motor vehicle on a public road from using a hand-held mobile device (other than a voice-activated, vehicle-integrated or similar device, or a global positioning system [GPS] which is not vehicle-integrated); and (2) requires, upon conviction of a violation of such prohibition, the imposition of certain minimum penalties.</summary>
