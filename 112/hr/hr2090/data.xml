Energy Critical Elements Advancement Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the Secretary of Energy (DOE), acting through the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, to collaborate to improve assessments of energy critical elements. Requires the Director of the USGS to designate as a Principal Statistical Agency the entity within USGS that gathers information for such assessments. Directs the DOE Secretary to: (1) establish a research program to advance basic knowledge and enable expanded availability of designated energy critical elements, and (2) develop and update biennially an integrated research plan to guide program activities. Requires the Critical and Strategic Mineral Supply Chain Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council to report to certain congressional committees on the recycling of energy critical elements.</summary>
