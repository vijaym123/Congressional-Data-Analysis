Requires the Director of the USGS to designate as a Principal Statistical Agency the entity within USGS that gathers information for such assessments. Directs the DOE Secretary to: (1) establish a research program to advance basic knowledge and enable expanded availability of designated energy critical elements, and (2) develop and update biennially an integrated research plan to guide program activities. Requires the Critical and Strategic Mineral Supply Chain Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council to report to certain congressional committees on the recycling of energy critical elements."
