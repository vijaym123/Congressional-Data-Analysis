Allows the Secretary to include in such agreements a provision for the reimbursement of construction costs, including those construction costs incurred prior to this Act's enactment. Increases the authorization of appropriations for the design, planning, and construction of: (1) recycled water system facilities in cooperation with the city of Antioch, California; and (2) recycled water treatment facilities in cooperation with the city of San Jose, California, and the Santa Clara Valley Water District."
