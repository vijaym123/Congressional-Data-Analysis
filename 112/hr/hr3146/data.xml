  <summary>10/11/2011--Introduced.
American Innovation and Education Act of 2011 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a priority worker immigrant visa for an alien who has a qualifying: (1) master's or higher degree in a field of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM degree) from a U.S. institution of higher education; and (2) employment offer from a U.S. employer. Eliminates the foreign residency requirement for certain foreign students. Revises per country (and dependent) area limits to: (1) eliminate employment-based limits, and (2) increase family-based limits. Amends the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 to eliminate the provision requiring the reduction of annual Chinese (PRC) immigrant visas to offset status adjustments under such Act. Establishes in the Treasury the STEM Education and Training Account. Sets aside specified Account funds for: (1) a STEM scholarship program for low-income U.S. students enrolled in degree programs in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics; (2) a grant program to improve K-12 education, including through private-public partnerships; and (3) programs for STEM capacity building at minority-serving institutions of higher education. Revises labor certification provisions, including: (1) requiring the Department of Labor to adjudicate an application within 120 days, and (2) creating an Established U.S. Recruiter designation for recruiters who regularly recruit U.S. workers. Establishes in the Treasury the Labor Certification Application Fee Account. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a pre-certification procedure for employers who file multiple petitions for employment-based immigrants or for certain nonimmigrant workers. Makes the discretionary fee for employment-based petitions and applications mandatory.</summary>
