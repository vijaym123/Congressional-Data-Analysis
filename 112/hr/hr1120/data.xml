  <summary>3/16/2011--Introduced.
International Travelers Bill of Rights Act of 2011 - Requires an individual or entity that operates a website that provides access to international travel services to provide on its website, in a clear and conspicuous way, information regarding the health and safety risks of overseas vacation destinations marketed on the site, including (1) information compiled by the Department of State that includes country-specific travel warnings and alerts; and (2) information on the availability of onsite health and safety services or a disclaimer that such services may not be available and travel may pose an increased risk to health or safety. Requires a site operator to: (1) establish a process under which an overseas vacation destination will be suspended from its website as a result of consumer complaints regarding poor medical care, unsafe or unsanitary facilities, or other health-related issues; and (2) make all such complaints publicly available on its website. Allows an operator to modify complaints at the request of the complainant and to remove offensive language and personal identification information. Treats a violation as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.</summary>
