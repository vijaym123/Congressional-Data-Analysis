  <summary>12/7/2012--Public Law.
Postpones until April 15, 2013, the effective date of the requirement under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 (STOCK Act) that the Secretary of the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives ensure that financial disclosure forms filed by congressional officers and employees be made available to the public on the respective official Senate and House websites within 30 days after filing. Postpones until the same date the effective date of the requirement that the President ensure that financial disclosure forms filed by executive branch employees are publicly available on appropriate official websites of executive branch agencies within such period. Excludes from these effective date postponements the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, congressional candidates, and any officer occupying a position listed under Level I and Level II of the Executive Schedule having been nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. (Thus maintains September 30, 2012, as the effective date of the requirement that such individuals make their financial disclosure forms available to the public.)</summary>
