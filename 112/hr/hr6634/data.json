Postpones until the same date the effective date of the requirement that the President ensure that financial disclosure forms filed by executive branch employees are publicly available on appropriate official websites of executive branch agencies within such period. Excludes from these effective date postponements the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, congressional candidates, and any officer occupying a position listed under Level I and Level II of the Executive Schedule having been nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. (Thus maintains September 30, 2012, as the effective date of the requirement that such individuals make their financial disclosure forms available to the public.)"
