Conditions establishment of an area upon: (1) inclusion of at least 200,000 acres of NFS land; (2) a state forest practices law or regulatory structure applicable to state or privately owned forest land; (3) agreement with the governor by the county in which the land is located requiring the county, in using revenues received from the area, to continue to meet obligations under applicable state law pursuant to the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 or other provisions concerning payment of receipts for the benefit of public schools and roads. Excludes from a community forest demonstration area land that is a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System or on which the removal of vegetation is specifically prohibited by federal law.
