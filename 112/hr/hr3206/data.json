Requires the Secretary to consider, with respect to any financial interest constituting a potential conflict of interest, the type, nature, and magnitude of the financial interest. Declares that no specific factor shall be dispositive in the Secretary's evaluation of a particular financial interest. Repeals the prohibition specifically applicable to FDA that prevents a member of an advisory committee from participating with respect to a particular matter if such individual or an immediate family member of such individual has a financial interest that could be affected by the advice given to the Secretary."
