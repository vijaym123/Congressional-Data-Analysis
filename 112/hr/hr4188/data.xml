  <summary>3/8/2012--Introduced.
None of Our Funds in the Interest or for the Exercise or Leisure of Detainees Act or NO FIELD Act - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Department of Defense (DOD) should not use taxpayer funds to provide recreational facilities for individuals detained at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Reduces the discretionary spending limit by $750,000 for the security category for FY2013 under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Requires any savings resulting from such reduction to be retained in the Treasury for deficit reduction purposes.</summary>
