  <summary>12/16/2011--Introduced.
Downed Animal and Food Safety Protection Act - States that it is U.S. policy that all nonambulatory livestock in interstate and foreign commerce be immediately and humanely euthanized when such livestock become nonambulatory. Amends the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to promulgate regulations providing for the humane treatment, handling, and disposition of nonambulatory livestock by specified entities, including a requirement that nonambulatory livestock be humanely euthanized. Requires an entity to: (1) humanely euthanize nonambulatory livestock (while not limiting the Secretary's ability to test nonambulatory livestock for disease, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy), and (2) not move nonambulatory livestock unless required for a specific test for disease. Prohibits an inspector at an establishment covered by the Federal Meat Inspection Act from passing through inspection any nonambulatory livestock, carcass, or carcass parts and requires an inspector at such establishment to label such material as "inspected and condemned."</summary>
