  <summary>7/12/2011--Passed House amended.
Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2011 - (Sec. 2) Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (NFIA) to extend through FY2016 the financing for National Flood Insurance Program (Program). (Sec. 3) Amends the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (FDPA) to authorize the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to suspend temporarily the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement for areas designated as having special flood hazards, if they meet certain eligibility requirements. Authorizes the Administrator, upon request of the relevant local government authority, to extend such suspension period for an additional 12 months if the Administrator finds that more than adequate progress has been made on the construction of a flood protection system for the area. Excludes from such extension certain improved real estate or mobile home properties with new mortgages. Revises the requirement that the lender or servicer of a loan, in the case of a borrower who has failed to purchase flood insurance, purchase it on the borrower's behalf and charge the borrower for the cost of the premiums and fees incurred. Includes among such premiums or fees those incurred for coverage beginning on the date on which flood insurance coverage either lapsed or did not provide a sufficient coverage amount. Requires a lender or servicer who receives confirmation of a borrower's existing flood insurance coverage to terminate force-placed insurance and refund to the borrower all force-placed insurance premiums (including related fees). Requires each federal entity for lending regulation to direct regulated lending institutions to accept private flood insurance if it meets federal flood insurance requirements. Requires each federal agency lender, as well as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), to accept private flood insurance as satisfaction of the flood insurance purchase requirement if it meets such requirements. (Sec. 4) Amends NFIA to prescribe minimum annual flood insurance deductibles of $2,000 for subsidized rate properties and of $1,000 for actuarial rate properties. Revises the requirement that additional flood insurance in excess of specified limits be made available to any residential building for which the risk premium is determined in accordance with certain requirements so as to enable the insured or insurance applicant to receive coverage up to an aggregate liability of $250,000. Specifies that such additional flood insurance be made available only to a residential building designed for the occupancy of from one to four families. Applies the $250,000 aggregate flood insurance liability to any single building of that description. Makes technical revisions to analogous requirements for additional flood insurance in the case of any nonresidential building, including a church. Sets forth a formula for indexing maximum coverage limits. Prescribes optional coverage of up to: (1) $5,000 aggregate liability for any necessary increases in living expenses for loss of use of a personal residence, and (2) $20,000 for business interruption with regard to any commercial property or other residential property, including multifamily rental property. Requires flood insurance regulations to allow payment of flood insurance premiums in installments, at increased chargeable premium rates and surcharges. Specifies the coverage of a new flood insurance policy on properties affected by floods in progress during the 30-day waiting period before the policy's effective date. Covers damage to the property resulting from such a flood that occurs after expiration of the waiting period, but only if the property has not suffered damage or loss as a result of that flood before expiration of the period.(Sec. 5) Raises from 10% to 20% of the average of the risk premium rates for the properties concerned the annual limitation on premium increases. Schedules a 5-year phase-in of chargeable risk premium rates, in annual 20% increments, for flood insurance coverage for an area that has been upgraded to a special flood hazard area (newly mapped risk premium rate area). Specifies a different 5-year phase-in period for a risk premium in the case of preferred risk rate areas. Limits to the applicable estimated risk premium (actuarial) rate for an area the chargeable rate for: (1) any nonresidential (commercial) property, (2) second homes and vacation homes, (3) single-family properties (built or improved before the end of 1974) sold to new owners, (4) property sustaining over 50% flood damage or over 30% improvement after enactment of this Act, and (5) any severe repetitive loss property. Prohibits extension of subsidized rates for policies lapsed as a result of the policy holder's deliberate choice. Makes communities making adequate progress at reconstruction or improvement to 100-year frequency flood protection systems eligible for premium flood insurance rates that would apply if the reconstruction or improvement were completed. Revises requirements for special flood hazard rates for a community in the process of restoring flood protection afforded by a system previously accredited as providing 100-year frequency flood protection but no longer does so.
