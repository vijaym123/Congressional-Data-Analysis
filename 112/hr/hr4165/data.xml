  <summary>3/8/2012--Introduced.
CT Colonography Screening for Colorectal Cancer Act of 2012 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to: (1) provide Medicare coverage for screening computed tomography colonography (CTC) as a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test, and (2) exclude screening CTC from the meaning of "imaging services" for which there is a special rule regarding outpatient services department (OPD) fee schedule payments. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to submit a preliminary report to Congress on the status of coverage of CTC as a CRC screening test under Medicare, including the extent to which such coverage as required by this Act has been implemented.</summary>
