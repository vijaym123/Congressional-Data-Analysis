  <summary>3/31/2011--Introduced.
Amends the Act commonly known as the Indian Reorganization Act to except lands in Alaska from the Secretary of the Interior's authority to acquire any interest in lands, water rights, or surface rights to lands, within or without existing reservations, for the purpose of providing land for Indians. Applies that Act to all federally recognized Indian tribes, regardless of when any tribe became recognized. (This effectively overrules the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri v. Salazar, which held that the Secretary could not take land into trust for a specified tribe because that tribe had not been under federal jurisdiction when the Act was enacted.)</summary>
