  <summary>5/3/2011--Introduced.
Nuclear Disaster Preparedness Act - Directs the President to issue guidance on the federal response to any nuclear disaster that: (1) may be caused by a natural catastrophe, an accident, or a terrorist or other attack; (2) occurs initially at a nuclear power plant; and (3) disperses radiation off the reactor site and into the surrounding area. Requires such guidance to: (1) designate the federal agency responsible for coordinating the government's efforts in response to a nuclear disaster (coordinating agency), including making a formal declaration that a nuclear disaster exists, and to identify the circumstances under which such declaration will occur; (2) designate the agency responsible for recommending the evacuation of an area surrounding a nuclear power plant in response to such a disaster and to identify the circumstances under which such recommendation will be made; (3) designate the agency responsible for conducting such evacuation; (4) designate the agency responsible for recommending that evacuees may return following a nuclear disaster and to identify the circumstances under which such recommendation will be made; and (5) designate the agency responsible for conducting cleanup of a nuclear disaster and to identify what cleanup standards will apply.</summary>
