  <summary>3/16/2011--Introduced.
Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Preparedness Planning Act - Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a competitive program to make grants for emergency preparedness planning and implementation to local educational agencies and districts located in areas under a high threat of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or public health emergencies. Directs the Secretary, in awarding grants, to give priority to: (1) local educational agencies and districts located in areas with higher population densities that are under a higher threat of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or public health emergencies; and (2) such agencies and districts that have demonstrated the ability to formulate and implement effective emergency preparedness plans. Requires a local educational agency or district receiving a grant to use such funds to formulate and implement an emergency preparedness plan, which shall provide for: (1) the creation in the office of the superintendent or other chief executive officer of the local educational agency or district of a School Emergency Response Center; (2) the creation of a Regional Advisory Council; and (3) the development of a plan specific to each school under the local educational agency's or district's authority for each type of emergency likely to occur in the area. Permits remaining funds to be used for any purpose relating to emergency preparedness planning or implementation.</summary>
