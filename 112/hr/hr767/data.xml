  <summary>2/17/2011--Introduced.
Personal Responsibility in Health Care Insurance Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit an individual to avoid the requirements to maintain minimum essential coverage by signing an affidavit of personal responsibility with respect to the individual or any dependents. Requires such an affidavit to include an acknowledgment that the individual is waiving: (1) eligibility to enroll in a qualified health plan through a health insurance exchange, (2) the applicability of provisions prohibiting preexisting condition exclusions, and (3) the ability to discharge health care debts in a bankruptcy. Makes an exemption effective for three years and renewable. Sets forth eligibility requirements, including that such individual is not eligible for any other exemption from the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage and is not enrolled in any minimum essential coverage.</summary>
