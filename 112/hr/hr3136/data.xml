  <summary>10/6/2011--Introduced.
Congressional Accountability Pay Act - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to revise the method of adjusting the annual rate of pay of Members of Congress. Requires a decrease in the rate of pay for each Member by a specified percentage if outlays for any fiscal year are greater than outlays for the preceding fiscal year. Amends the Federal Salary Act of 1967 to require that recommendations by the Citizens' Commission on Public Service and Compensation conform with this Act, except those for the salaries of the Chief Justice of the United States, judges of U.S. district courts, and judges of the U.S. Court of International Trade.</summary>
