  <summary>9/21/2012--Introduced.
Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), with respect to budget enforcement through sequestration, to redefine "account" to include any item for the pay of Members of Congress. (Thus subjects the pay of Members of Congress to reduction under a sequestration.)</summary>
