Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to: (1) deny a judgment evading foreign state access to U.S. capital markets; and (2) require all periodic filings made by such a state with the SEC to bear prominently a warning describing its failure to satisfy outstanding judgments. Imposes similar restrictions on state-owned corporations of such states. Requires: (1) a proposal to extend bilateral or multilateral assistance to a judgment evading state to bear notice that such state is a judgment evading state; and (2) the Secretary of the Treasury to notify Congress promptly of the proposal."
