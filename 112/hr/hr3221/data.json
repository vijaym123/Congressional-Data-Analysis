    "text": "Job Creation and Energy Efficiency Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to authorize the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to provide credit support to ameliorate risks for a debt or repayment obligation incurred in connection with financing the installation and implementation of efficiency, advanced metering, distributed generation, or renewable energy technologies and measures that are expected to increase the energy efficiency of one or more buildings (including fixtures). Makes commercial, multifamily residential, industrial, municipal, government institutions of higher education, school, and hospital facilities eligible for such support. Includes among financing mechanisms that qualify as efficiency obligations: (1) loans, (2) power purchase agreements, (3) energy services agreements, (4) property assessed clean energy bonds and other tax assessment-based financing mechanisms, and (5) aggregate on-meter agreements that finance retrofit projects. Requires the Secretary to prioritize: (1) the maximization of energy savings with the available credit support funding; (2) the establishment of a clear application and approval process that allows private building owners, lenders, and investors to reasonably expect to receive credit support for projects that conform to guidelines; (3) the distribution of projects receiving credit support across states or geographical regions; and (4) projects designed to achieve whole-building retrofits. Prohibits the Secretary from issuing credit support that exceeds: (1) 90% of the principal amount of the obligation that is the subject of the support, or (2) $25 million for any project. Requires the Secretary to report on such support. Authorizes the Secretary to charge reasonable fees for such support."
