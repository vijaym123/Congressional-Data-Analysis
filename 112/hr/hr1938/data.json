Requires each such agency to comply with any deadline the Secretary establishes. Directs the President, within 30 days after the final environmental impact statement, but not later than November 1, 2011, to issue a final order granting or denying the Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. States that no action by the Secretary pursuant to this Act shall affect any duty or responsibility to comply with any requirement to conduct environmental review. Declares the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States must decrease its dependence on oil from countries hostile to its interests, and (2) increased access to Canadian energy resources will create jobs in the United States."
