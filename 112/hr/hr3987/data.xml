  <summary>2/8/2012--Introduced.
Small Business Protection Act of 2012 - Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), when establishing small business size standards, to establish or approve a single standard for a grouping of four-digit North American Industrial Classification codes only if the Administrator makes publicly available, no later than the date on which it is established or approved, a justification that such standard is appropriate for each individual industry classification in the grouping. Requires the Administrator, in conducting rulemaking to revise, modify, or establish size standards, to consider and address: (1) the industry for which the new standard is proposed, (2) the competitive environment for that industry, (3) the approach used to develop the proposed standard, and (4) the anticipated effect of the proposed rulemaking on the industry.</summary>
