Authorizes qualifying individuals to elect to participate in a program under which personal Social Security savings accounts are established for investment pursuant to various options. Prescribes requirements for Tier I and Tier II Investment Funds for the investment of personal Social Security savings contributions calculated according to a specified formula. Specifies Tier I and Tier II investment options. Prescribes requirements for: (1) distributions from personal Social Security savings accounts for purchase of annuities from an Annuity Issuance Authority, and (2) guaranteed Social Security benefits regardless of whether such an annuity is purchased. Requires a reduction in monthly Social Security insurance benefits, according to a certain formula, for personal savings program participants. Establishes a Personal Social Security Savings Board to administer the program and establish investment policies. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to subject distributions from personal Social Security savings accounts to income tax. Establishes in the Treasury a Personal Social Security Savings Program Spending Reduction Account to which the Secretary of the Treasury shall credit the amount of savings for a fiscal year derived from legislation reducing or terminating federal programs. Requires the Managing Trustee of the OASDI Trust Funds, at the end of any reimbursement year for which for which there is a Savings Program excess balance in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, to transfer from them to the Spending Reduction Account sums necessary to reimburse it."
