  <summary>2/3/2012--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to ensure that any crude oil and bitumen transported by the Keystone XL pipeline, and all refined petroleum products whose origin was via importation of crude oil or bitumen by the Keystone XL pipeline, will be entered into domestic commerce for final disposition. Authorizes the President to waive such requirement in the national interest under specified conditions, including where: (1) an exchange of crude oil or refined product provides for no net loss of crude oil or refined product consumed domestically, or (2) a waiver is necessary under the Constitution, a law, or an international agreement.</summary>
