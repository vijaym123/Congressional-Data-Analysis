  <summary>3/16/2011--Introduced.
Air Ambulance Patient Safety, Protection, and Coordination Act - Authorizes states to regulate medical aspects of intrastate air ambulance services with respect to: (1) the quality of emergency medical care provided to patients by air ambulances; (2) the availability of air ambulance services provided to patients with emergency medical conditions; (3) communication between emergency medical and public safety agencies and hospitals as well as the flightcrew and air ambulance medical personnel; (4) the accessibility of emergency medical care provided by air ambulances and the incorporation and integration of air ambulance services into state emergency medical services systems; (5) the acceptability of air ambulance services to ensure the adequate provision by air ambulances of medically necessary emergency medical care to critically ill and injured patients; and (6) the physical attributes of the air ambulance necessary for protection of the ambulance, ground, and emergency response personnel. Requires an air ambulance medical service provider licensed in more than one state, if the different state air ambulance medical services regulations are inconsistent, to comply with the most stringent regulation. Requires a state, if necessary, to establish regulations or negotiate mutual aid agreements with adjacent states or air ambulances to ensure access to air ambulance services across state borders.</summary>
