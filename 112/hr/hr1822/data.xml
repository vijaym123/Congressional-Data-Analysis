No Health Care Subsidies for Illegal Aliens Act of 2011 - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to revise the procedures for determining eligibility for participation in a state health care insurance exchange (Exchange), with respect to citizenship or immigration status, to: (1) require an applicant for enrollment in a qualified health plan (enrollee)&#160;to appear in person at an Exchange and&#160;submit a sworn statement, under penalty of perjury, that the enrollee is a citizen or national of the United States or an eligible alien; (2) expand the documentary evidence that enrollees must submit for purposes of verifying eligibility; (3) require Exchanges (currently, the Secretary of Health and Human Services [HHS]) to verify citizenship or immigration status of enrollees based on satisfactory documentary evidence;&#160; (4) eliminate the authority of the Secretary to modify the methods used to verify enrollee eligibility; and (5) eliminate provisions authorizing the Secretary to verify the accuracy of submitted information. Applies this Act as if included in the enactment of PPACA.</summary>
