Physician Reentry Demonstration Program Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) establish a demonstration program to assist the development of innovative programs that facilitate physician reentry into clinical practice to provide required primary health services; and (2) award one grant, on a competitive basis, to an eligible entity in each of the 10 regions served by a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regional office.

Requires a reentering physician who participates in a demonstration program, to be eligible to receive benefits, to provide required primary health services for at least two years at a health center, a Veterans Administration Medical Center if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) certifies that there is a shortage of physicians at such center, or a school-based health center.
