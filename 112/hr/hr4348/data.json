Directs the Secretary to distribute federal-aid highway funds apportioned to states for each fiscal year: (1) among the national highway performance (new core program), the surface transportation, (new core program), the highway safety improvement, the national freight (new core program), and the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement (CMAQ) programs; as well as (2) to metropolitan transportation planning. (Sec. 1106) Directs the Secretary to establish and implement a national highway performance program. (Effectively consolidates the interstate maintenance, NHS, and part of the highway bridge programs.) Requires states to develop risk-based asset management plans that include strategies leading to projects that would make progress toward achieving state targets and national goals to improve infrastructure condition and performance on the NHS. Requires a state to obligate a specified amount of the apportionment of national highway performance program funds for the restoration of certain Interstate System (IS) pavement and NHS bridges. Makes natural habitat and wetlands mitigation projects eligible for national highway performance program funds. (Sec. 1107) Revises the emergency relief fund program. Reauthorizes appropriations for the emergency relief fund for the repair or reconstruction of highways, roads, and trails damaged as a result of a disaster. Makes the costs of debris removal due to such a disaster an eligible expense for emergency relief program funding. Authorizes the Secretary to obligate fund amounts for the repair or reconstruction of disaster-affected tribal transportation facilities, federal lands transportation facilities, and other federally-owned roads that are open to public travel, whether or not they are federal-aid highways. (Sec. 1108) Revises surface transportation program (STP) eligibility requirements. Revises formulae for the state apportionment of STP funds in urbanized areas with populations over 200,000, nonurbanized areas with populations over 5,000, and in other areas. Requires a state to obligate a specified amount of the apportionment of STP funds for the improvement of certain deficient off-system bridges. Authorizes a state to obligate a specified amount of the apportionment of STP funds on roads classified as minor collectors in areas with populations less than 5,000. (Sec. 1109) Requires the Secretary to deduct a certain amount from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) administrative funds per fiscal year (instead of whenever certain apportionments are made) for: (1) surface transportation and technology on-the-job training programs, and (2) training programs for minority business enterprises to achieve proficiency to compete for federal-aid highway contracts and subcontracts. (Sec. 1110) Directs the Secretary to deduct for each of FY2013-FY2014 at least $10 million from FHWA administrative expenses for highway use tax evasion projects. (Sec. 1111) Revises the highway bridge program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) inventory all highway bridges and tunnels, (2) determine the cost of replacing structurally deficient bridges, (3) establish national inspection standards for evaluating all highway bridges and tunnels for safety and serviceability, and (4) establish a training program for highway bridge and tunnel inspectors.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) study the best practices for implementing cost-effective roadway safety infrastructure improvements on high-risk rural roads; and (2) develop, based on the study results, a best practices manual for federal, state, and local efforts to reduce fatalities and serious bodily injury crashes on such roads. (Sec. 1113) Revises CMAQ program eligibility requirements. Authorizes a state to obligate CMAQ program funds apportioned for a transportation project in a nonattainment area for ozone, carbon monoxide, or particulate matter for a project that shifts traffic demand to nonpeak hours or other transportation modes, increases vehicle occupancy rates, or otherwise reduces demand for roads through means such as telecommuting, ridesharing, carsharing, alternative work hours, and pricing. Authorizes a state to obligate the apportionment of CMAQ program funds: (1) for projects to reduce particulate matter within areas designated nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide, or both, and for PM-10 resulting from transportation activities; and (2) to establish electric vehicle charging stations or natural gas vehicle refueling stations. Requires states to obligate 25% of the apportionment of CMAQ program funds for projects to reduce fine particulate matter emissions within areas designated as nonattainment or maintenance for PM2.5, including diesel retrofits. Requires each metropolitan planning organization (MPO) serving a nonattainment or maintenance area with a population over 1 million people to develop a performance plan that describes projects that will achieve certain emission and traffic congestion reduction targets. Requires the Secretary to assess the outcomes of emissions or traffic congestion reduction projects funded under the CMAQ program. (Sec. 1114) Revises and replaces the Puerto Rico highway program with the Territorial and Puerto Rico highway program. (Effectively consolidates the programs.) Makes certain allocations for the Puerto Rico highway and territorial highway programs for resurfacing and reconstruction, highway safety improvement, surface transportation program, preventive maintenance, and ferry boats and terminal facilities projects. Repeals the current territorial highway program. (Sec. 1115) Directs the Secretary to; (1) establish a national freight network to improve movement of freight on highways, including freight intermodal connectors and national highway and aerotropolis transportation systems; and (2) develop, periodically update, and post on the Department of Transportation (DOT) website a national freight strategic plan including specified assessments and best practices. Defines \"aerotropolis transportation system\" as a planned and coordinated multimodal freight and passenger transportation network that provides efficient, cost-effective, sustainable, and intermodal connectivity to a defined region of economic significance centered around a major airport. Directs the Secretary to designate a primary freight network consisting of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways most critical to the movement of freight. Authorizes a state to designate a road within state borders, meeting specified criteria, as a critical rural freight corridor. Directs the Secretary to prepare biennially a report containing a description of the conditions and performance of the national freight network. Directs the Secretary to begin development of new transportation investment data and planning tools or to improve existing tools to support an outcome-oriented, performance-based approach to evaluate proposed freight-related and other transportation projects. (Sec. 1116) Authorizes the Secretary to increase the federal share of costs for Interstate System (IS) projects to 95% and 90% for any other project meeting specified requirements that improves the efficient movement of freight. (Sec. 1117) Directs the Secretary to encourage states to establish state freight advisory committees to provide advice on freight-related priorities, issues, projects, and funding needs. (Sec. 1118) Directs the Secretary to encourage states to develop state freight plans for immediate and long-range planning activities and investments with respect to freight. (Sec. 1119) Revises requirements for making authorized funds available for the tribal transportation, federal lands transportation, and federal lands access programs for various transportation planning and highway improvement projects. (Sec. 1120) Amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to require the Secretary to provide grants to state departments of transportation, tribal governments, transit agencies, or multi-state agencies for projects of national and regional significance. Requires congressional approval for federal funding of such projects. Authorizes appropriations for FY2013. (Sec. 1121) Revises the formula for the allocation of federal-aid highway funds to states for construction of ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities. Authorizes appropriations for FY2013-FY2014. Revises requirements for the National Ferry Database to include information on federal, state, and local government funding sources for ferry systems. Requires the Secretary to ensure that the database is consistent with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) national transit database. Makes amounts for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics available for the database through FY2014. (Sec. 1122) Directs the Secretary to reserve a specified proportion of transportation enhancements program funds apportioned to a state for FY2009 for surface transportation alternatives, recreational trails program, and safe routes to school program projects as well as planning or constructing boulevards and other roadways of former IS routes or other divided highways. Makes certain allocations of reserved funds to states or MPOs for such projects in urbanized areas with populations over 200,000, nonurbanized areas with populations over 5,000, and in other areas. (Sec. 1123) Directs the Secretary to carry out a Tribal High Priority Projects program. Authorizes Indian tribes to submit applications for emergency or disaster projects to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations for FY2013-FY2014. Subtitle B: Performance Management - (Sec. 1201) Revises metropolitan transportation and statewide transportation planning requirements. Requires MPOs, in developing long-range metropolitan transportation plans and transportation improvement programs (TIPs) for metropolitan planning areas, to use a process that establishes certain performance measures and targets for the metropolitan transportation planning of federal-aid highway projects. Authorizes an MPO to elect to develop multiple scenarios for consideration as part of the development of the metropolitan transportation plan. Authorizes funding. (Sec. 1202) Requires each state, in developing a statewide transportation plan and a statewide transportation improvement program (STIP), to use similar performance measures and targets for the statewide transportation planning of federal-aid highway projects. Authorizes funding. Authorizes states to establish regional transportation organizations for the nonmetropolitan transportation planning of federal-aid highway projects. (Sec. 1203) Declares that it is in the interest of the United States to focus the federal-aid highway program on certain national goals, including to: (1) significantly reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads, (2) maintain the highway infrastructure system in a state of good repair, (3) improve the efficiency of the surface transportation system, (4) improve the national freight network and support regional economic development, (5) enhance the performance of the transportation system while protecting the natural environment, and (6) reduce project delivery delays. Directs the Secretary to establish performance measures and standards for states to use to assess: (1) IS and NHS pavements and bridges, (2) highway injuries and fatalities, (3) traffic congestion and gas emissions, and (4) freight movement on the IS. Requires states to: (1) establish performance targets that reflect such assessments; and (2) report biennially to the Secretary on the condition and performance of the NHS, progress in achieving the performance targets, and the ways states are addressing congestion at freight bottlenecks. Subtitle C: Acceleration of Project Delivery - (Sec. 1301) Directs the Secretary to carry out a project delivery acceleration initiative to identify, develop, and advance the use of best practices and deployment of technology and innovation to accelerate project delivery and to reduce project costs for transportation projects and programs while enhancing safety and protecting the environment. Declares that it is U.S. policy to expedite the delivery of surface transportation projects by substantially reducing the average length of the environmental review process for them. (Sec. 1302) Authorizes a state (at its own expense) to acquire real property interests for an approved surface transportation project before the completion of its environmental review process under NEPA without affecting subsequent project approval by the state or any federal agency. Authorizes the Secretary to authorize the use of federal funds for a state's early acquisition of real property interests for a surface transportation project. Requires the Secretary to complete the NEPA environmental review process before authorizing such a use. (Sec. 1303) Authorizes a contracting agency (state transportation department) to award, on a competitive basis, a two-phase contract to a construction manager or general contractor for pre-construction and construction services on federal-aid highway projects. (Sec. 1304) Declares that it is in the national interest to promote the use of innovative technologies and practices that increase the efficiency of construction, improve the safety, and extend the service life of highways and bridges. Allows the federal share payable on account of a project or activity, at state discretion, to be up to 100% percent if it: (1) contains innovative project delivery methods that improve work zone safety for motorists or workers and the quality of the facility; (2) contains innovative technologies, manufacturing processes, financing, or contracting methods that improve the quality, extend the service life, or decrease the long-term costs of maintaining highways and bridges; (3) accelerates project delivery while complying with other applicable federal laws (including regulations) and not causing any significant adverse environmental impact; or (4) reduces congestion related to highway construction. (Sec. 1305) Directs the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking to allow for the use of programmatic approaches meeting specified requirements to conduct environmental reviews of surface transportation projects. (Sec. 1306) Authorizes the Secretary within 30 days after the close of the public comment period on a draft environmental impact statement, to convene a meeting with the project sponsor, lead agency, resource agencies, and any relevant state agencies to ensure that all parties are on schedule to meet deadlines for decisions to be made regarding the project. Authorizes the Secretary, if those agencies cannot provide reasonable assurances that those deadlines will be met, and before the completion of the record of decision, to initiate an accelerated issue resolution and referral process according to specified requirements. Prescribes administrative penalties for federal agency failure to render a decision. (Sec. 1307) Revises requirements for the provision of federal funds at state request for a project subject to the environmental review process to support activities that directly and meaningfully contribute to expediting and improving transportation project planning and delivery for projects in that state. Requires the affected federal agency and the state agency, with respect to funds for dedicated staffing at that federal agency, to enter into a memorandum of understanding that establishes the projects and priorities to be addressed by the use of those funds. (Sec. 1308) Decreases from 180 days to 150 days after Federal Register publication of a notice the deadline for filing a claim seeking judicial review of the permit, license, or approval for a highway or public transportation capital project. (Sec. 1309) Requires the Secretary, upon the request of a project sponsor or the governor of the state in which the project is located, to provide additional technical assistance to resolve within four years any project issues and project delay related to environmental review under NEPA. (Sec. 1310) Authorizes the federal lead agency (DOT) to adopt and use a planning product (resulting from the decisionmaking process) in proceedings relating to any class of action in the environmental review process of a surface transportation project. (Sec. 1311) Authorizes a state or MPO, as part of the statewide or metropolitan transportation process, to develop one or more programmatic mitigation plans to address potential environmental impacts of future transportation projects. (Sec. 1312) Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a state, as a condition of assuming responsibility for categorical exclusions, to forego project delivery methods otherwise permissible for highway projects. Authorizes a state to terminate its assumption of responsibility for designating activities for categorical exclusion from requirements for environmental assessments or environmental impact statements. (A \"categorical exclusion\" under NEPA is a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementing environmental regulations and for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.) (Sec. 1313) Converts the surface transportation project delivery pilot program into a permanent program, making all states eligible to participate. Revises requirements for the written agreement between DOT and a state that assumed DOT responsibilities for environmental review, consultation, or other action required under any federal environmental law pertaining to the review or approval of a specific project. Prohibits transfer to a state, however, of DOT responsibilities for: (1) metropolitan, statewide, or nonmetropolitan transportation planning; or (2) any conformity determination under the Clean Air Act with respect to the bar against support or financial assistance to any activity that does not conform to an approved or promulgated state implementation plans for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a state, as a condition of participation in the surface transportation project delivery program, to forego project delivery methods otherwise permissible for projects. Requires a written agreement to: (1) require the state to provide the Secretary information necessary to ensure that it is adequately carrying out such responsibilities, (2) have a term of no more than five years, and (3) be renewable. Requires the Secretary to monitor state compliance with the written agreement after its fourth year of participation in the program, including state provision of financial resources to carry out the agreement. Authorizes a state to terminate its participation in the program at any time by giving the Secretary 90 days notice. (Sec. 1314) Repeals certain requirements for joint activities of the Secretary with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Authorizes a multimodal project lead DOT authority (operating administration or secretarial office) to apply a categorical exclusion (that does not involve significant environmental impact), designated under the implementing regulations or procedures of a cooperating DOT authority that is not the lead authority, for other components of a multimodal transportation project if specified conditions are met. (Sec. 1315) Requires the Secretary to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to treat repair or reconstruction of any road, highway, or bridge damaged or declared emergency as a result of a natural disaster as categorically excluded from environmental assessment or environmental impact statement requirements under NEPA. (Sec. 1316) Directs the Secretary to designate any federal-aid highway project within an existing right-of-way as categorically excluded from environmental assessments or environmental impact statement requirements under NEPA. (Sec. 1317) Requires the Secretary to designate a categorical exclusion for projects receiving less than $5 million (or projects with a total estimated cost of not more than $30 million and federal funding of less than 15% of project costs). (Sec. 1318) Directs the Secretary to: (1) survey the DOT's use of categorical exclusions for transportation projects since 2005; and (2) publish a review of the survey, including any requests for new categorical exclusions. Requires the Secretary to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to propose new categorical exclusions received by the Secretary. (Sec. 1319) Prescribes procedures for accelerating the project delivery decisionmaking process with respect to: (1) environmental review of projects, (2) coordination among relevant agencies in meeting project deadlines, and (3) issue resolution and referral. (Sec. 1320) Declares the sense of Congress about early cooperation on environmental review and project delivery activities between DOT and other federal agencies with relevant jurisdiction in the environmental review process, including development of policies and designation of staff that advise planning agencies or project sponsors of studies or other information foreseeably required for later federal action and early consultation with state and local agencies and Indian tribes. Requires DOT and such federal agencies to provide technical assistance to a state or local planning agency if requested. Authorizes the lead agency to establish memoranda of agreement with the project sponsor, state, and local governments and other appropriate entities to accomplish specified early coordination activities. (Sec. 1321) Directs the Secretary to establish an initiative to review and develop consistent procedures for environmental permitting and procurement requirements for DOT formula grant programs. Requires the Secretary to publish the initiative in an electronically accessible format. (Sec. 1322) Requires the Comptroller General (GAO) to: (1) review state laws for conducting environmental reviews of federal-aid highway projects, and (2) determine the frequency and cost of environmental reviews at the federal level that duplicate state reviews providing equivalent environmental protections and opportunities for public involvement. (Sec. 1323) Directs the Secretary to compare the completion times of categorical exclusions, environmental assessments, and environmental impact statements for federal-aid highway projects among specified time periods. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on such review, including any change in the timing for completions and reasons for any such change, as well as reasons for any delays in excess of five years. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the types and justification for additional categorical exclusions granted by the Secretary. Directs the Comptroller General and the DOT Inspector General each to assess the accelerated project delivery reforms made in this Act. Subtitle D: Highway Safety - (Sec. 1401) Jason's Law - Expresses the sense of Congress that it is a national priority to address projects for the shortage of long-term parking for commercial motor vehicles on the NHS to improve the safety of motorized and nonmotorized users and for commercial motor vehicle operators. Makes eligible to be a federal-aid highway project the construction of long-term parking facilities for commercial motor vehicles on the NHS. Directs the Secretary to survey and assess the availability of parking facilities for commercial motor vehicles in each state. Requires survey results be made available to the public on the DOT website. Authorizes a state to establish electric vehicle charging stations or natural gas vehicle refueling stations for battery-powered or natural gas-fueled trucks or other motor vehicles at such parking facilities. (Sec. 1402) Revises open container requirements. Requires the Secretary to withhold 2.5% (currently 3%) of a state's apportionment of national highway performance and surface transportation program funds if it has not enacted or is not enforcing a law that prohibits the possession of any open alcoholic beverage container, or the consumption of such beverage, in the passenger area of any motor vehicle on a public highway.

(Sec. 100224) Requires Write Your Own (WYO) program companies to submit to FEMA biennial expense reports for the prior five years. Requires FEMA to pass them on to the Comptroller General. (The WYO program, part of the National Flood Insurance Program, is a cooperative undertaking of the insurance industry and FEMA which allows participating property and casualty insurance companies to write and service the Standard Flood Insurance Policy in their own names. The companies receive an expense allowance for policies written and claims processed while the federal government retains responsibility for underwriting losses.) Requires the Administrator to: (1) develop a methodology for determining amounts to reimburse property and casualty insurance companies participating in the WYO program for selling, writing, and servicing flood insurance policies and adjusting claims; and (2) conduct a rulemaking proceeding to formulate revised reimbursements to WYO companies for their related expenses. Directs the Comptroller General to study the efficacy, adequacy, and sufficiency of such rules. (Sec. 100225) Revises requirements for mitigation assistance grants. Specifies grants: (1) to states and communities to carry out mitigation activities that reduce flood damage to severe repetitive loss properties, and (2) to property owners for mitigation activities that reduce flood damage to individual structures for which two or more flood insurance claim payments for losses have been made if neither the state nor community in which such a structure is located has the capacity to manage such grants. Allows a flood risk mitigation plan to be part of a multi-hazard mitigation plan. Restricts the Administrator to approving only mitigation activities that are technically feasible and cost-effective, or will eliminate future payments from the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF) for severe repetitive loss structures through an acquisition or relocation activity. Eliminates beach nourishment from eligible mitigation activities. Declares to be eligible mitigation activities: (1) elevation, relocation, or floodproofing of utilities; (2) state or community development or update of mitigation plans (as under current law); and (3) technical assistance to certain communities to identify eligible activities, develop grant applications, and implement mitigation grants. Directs the Administrator to consider as an eligible mitigation activity the demolition and rebuilding of properties to at least base flood elevation or greater. Specifies state and community matching requirements for severe repetitive loss structures (0%, or the expected savings to the NFIF from expected avoided damages through acquisition or relocation activities), repetitive loss structures (10%), and other mitigation activities (25%). Specifies the annual allocation of NFIF amounts for such activities. (Sec. 100226) Directs the Administrator and the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, jointly to establish a Flood Protection Structure Accreditation Task Force to develop a process to better align the information and data collected by or for the Corps of Engineers under the Inspection of Completed Works Program with flood protection structure accreditation requirements so that sufficient information and data collected for either purpose can be used interchangeably. (Sec. 100227) Requires the Administrator to review and report to Congress on the processes and procedures: (1) for determining that a flood event has commenced or is in progress, (2) for notifying the public about such an event, and (3) about the timing of public notification of flood insurance requirements and availability. Requires the review and report to include the effects and implications that weather conditions have on the determination that a flood event has commenced or is in progress. Deems a specified effective date of policies covering properties affected by the flooding of the Missouri River in 2011.

(Sec. 100228) Makes technical amendments to the requirements for additional flood insurance in excess of ordinary limits for residential and commercial properties. (Sec. 100229) Prohibits designation as a special flood hazard area, unless certain criteria are met, of any area or community participating in the Program that is: (1) or includes Community Identification Number 360467 and is impacted by the Jamaica Bay flooding source, or (2) Community Identification Number 360495. Requires any such designation to be based on: (1) flood hazard analyses of hydrologic, hydraulic, or coastal flood hazards that have been properly calibrated and validated, and are specific and directly relevant to the geographic area being studied; and (2) ground elevation information of sufficient accuracy and precision to meet FEMA guidelines for accuracy at the 95% confidence level. Requires the Administrator to remap, using compliant information and procedures, any rate map for either area if it has been designated a special flood hazard area on the basis of information that does not comply with these requirements. Requires reimbursement of policyholders, according to a specified formula, if a required revision and update to a rate map for such an area results in a reduction in the risk premium rate. (Sec. 100230) Makes eligible for flood insurance any person residing in a community participating in the Program that has made adequate progress on the reconstruction or improvement of a flood protection system that will afford flood protection for a 100-year floodplain. Limits the risk premium rate for such a person to one that does not exceed the risk premium rate that would be chargeable if the flood protection system had been completed. Specifies criteria for adequate progress. Prescribes eligibility requirements and community request procedures with respect to a person residing in a community participating in the Program that has begun reconstruction or improvement of a flood protection system that will afford flood protection for a 100-year floodplain (without regard to the level of Federal funding of or participation in the reconstruction or improvement).

Authorizes the Administrator to carry out appropriate private risk-management initiatives to determine the capacity of private insurers, reinsurers, and financial markets to assist communities, on a voluntary basis only, in managing the full range of financial risks associated with flooding. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress a private market pricing assessment regarding the capacity of the private reinsurance, capital, and financial markets to assist communities, on a voluntary basis, in managing the full range of financial risks associated with flooding by requesting proposals to assume a portion of the insurance risk of the National Flood Insurance Program. Requires the report to describe and assess proposals responding to the request. Authorizes the Administrator to secure reinsurance of flood insurance coverage from the private market, at rates and on terms that are reasonable and appropriate, in an amount sufficient to maintain the Program's ability to pay claims. Requires the Administrator to conduct annual assessments of the Program's ability to pay claims. (Sec. 100233) Directs the Comptroller General to study: (1) the availability of additional living expenses and business interruption coverage in the private marketplace for flood insurance, (2) the feasibility of allowing the Program to offer such coverage at the consumer's option, (3) the estimated cost to consumers if the Program priced such optional coverage at true actuarial rates, (4) the impact such optional coverage would have on consumer participation in the Program, and (5) the fiscal impact such optional coverage would have upon the NFIF if it were included in the Program at the price equal to the true actuarial rate. (Sec. 100234) Requires each flood insurance policy under the Program, subject to administrative penalty, to state all conditions, exclusions, and other limitations pertaining to coverage, regardless of the underlying insurance product, in plain English, in boldface type, and in a font size that is twice the size of the text of the body of the policy.
