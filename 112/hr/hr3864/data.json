Appropriates to the Highway Trust Fund amounts equivalent to the net increase in revenues from onshore and offshore domestic energy leasing and production resulting from the Alaskan Energy for American Jobs Act, the PIONEERS Act, and the Energy Security and Transportation Jobs Act. Terminates the authority for transfers of motor fuel tax revenues to the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund. Renames such Account as the Alternative Transportation Account and makes a one-time appropriation to such Account."
