Exempts from such delay, however, the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue final definitions pertaining to swap transactions, swap participants, and eligible contract participants. Requires the CFTC and the SEC to further define swaps and related terms subject to their joint rulemaking. States that the effective date for CFTC reporting of swap-data and SEC reporting of security-based swap data is 90 days after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register, or the effective date otherwise applicable to such reporting, whichever is later. Grants the CFTC and the SEC interim authority to permit the reporting of swap data and security-based swap data to certain persons who have: (1) provided notice of their intention to register as a swap data repository or as a security-based swap data repository, and (2) made appropriate undertakings to the respective Commission as the latter determines to be in the public interest. (Sec. 2) Requires the two Commissions, before prescribing final rules and regulations under Title VII, to conduct additional public hearings and roundtables on specified issues, solicit public comment, and take into account the testimony of interested parties when performing mandatory cost-benefit analyses and when determining the effective date of final rules and regulations. (Sec. 3) Amends the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to authorize the CFTC and the SEC, respectively, to exempt a person from the registration and related regulatory requirements of such Acts if: (1) the person is subject to comparable supervision and regulation under a regulatory scheme administered by another regulatory authority or the appropriate government authorities in the person's home country that is comparable to the requirements of Title VII, (2) adequate information-sharing arrangements are in effect between the agencies and the foreign regulator, and (3) the exemption is consistent with the public interest ."
