  <summary>9/20/2011--Introduced.
Innovate to Deliver Act of 2011 - Authorizes the United States Postal Service (USPS) to: (1) provide nonpostal services (e.g., check-cashing services, warehousing, public internet access services) using USPS infrastructure in a manner consistent with the public interest, and (2) invest excess moneys of the Competitive Products Fund. Requires the USPS Board of Governors to ensure that the rates and fees charged by USPS are at least equal to the total costs for providing postal services. Repeals the requirement for uniform postal rates for books, films, and other materials. Establishes in USPS the position of the Chief Innovation Officer who shall have proven expertise and success in the areas of innovation, research and development, and marketing. Requires the Postmaster General to submit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for maximizing revenues through innovative postal and nonpostal products and services. Requires the use of surplus contributions to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) in FY2011-FY 2016 for postal employees to encourage early retirement and provide voluntary separation incentive payments. Revises the prepayment schedule for the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefit Fund to allow amortization of payments over a longer period. Requires the Comptroller General to report on workforce reduction or realignment methods to align the USPS workforce with its needs.</summary>
