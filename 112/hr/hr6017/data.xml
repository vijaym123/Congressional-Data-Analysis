  <summary>6/25/2012--Introduced.
Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to exempt from the statutory 30-day waiting period for a new contract for flood insurance coverage the initial purchase of flood insurance coverage for private property if: (1) the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) determines that the property is affected by flooding on federal land that is a result of, or is exacerbated by, post-wildfire conditions; and (2) such coverage was purchased within 60 days after the fire containment date relating to the wildfire that caused the post-wildfire conditions.</summary>
