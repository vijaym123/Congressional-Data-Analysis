    "text": "Stop Government Shutdowns Act - Appropriates amounts for continuing federal projects and activities at the current rate for operations and under the authority and conditions provided in the applicable appropriation Act or Acts that provided funds for them for the previous fiscal year if, as a result of a failure to enact a regular or continuing appropriation Act or joint resolution, there is a lapse in appropriations for such projects or activities. Makes appropriations, funds, and authority granted in this Act available until the earliest of: (1) the enactment into law of an appropriation for the project or activity concerned, (2) the enactment into law of the applicable appropriation Act for such fiscal year without any provision for such project or activity, or (3) the last day of the fiscal year for which such appropriations and funds are made available or such authority is granted for such project or activity. Prohibits appropriations or funds made available or authority granted pursuant to this Act from being used to initiate or resume any project or activity for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were not available during the previous fiscal year. Authorizes the use of appropriations or funds made available or authority granted without regard to specified time limitations for submission and approval of apportionments requirements; but declares that nothing in this Act may be construed to waive any other provision of law governing the apportionment of funds. Prescribes requirements for: (1) denial of high rates for operation or complete distribution of appropriations in the lapsed-appropriations period, (2) the most limited funding action for continuation of projects and activities, and (3) apportionment of funds for civilian personnel compensation and benefits as necessary to avoid furloughs. Prohibits any decrease in the pay for members of the Armed Forces during a lapsed-appropriations period. Requires expenditures made pursuant to this Act to be charged to the applicable appropriation, fund, or authorization whenever an appropriations bill is subsequently enacted into law. Continues at a specified maintenance rate, through the date on which appropriations for such programs under this Act expires, certain activities with respect to entitlements and other mandatory payments whose budget authority was provided in previous appropriations Acts, as well as for activities under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008."
