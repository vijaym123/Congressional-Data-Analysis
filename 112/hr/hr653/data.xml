  <summary>2/11/2011--Introduced.
Financial Information Privacy Act of 2011 - Amends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to require a financial institution, as a prerequisite to providing disclosures of a consumer's personal information to nonaffiliated third parties, to obtain the consumer's consent on an express consent form. Prohibits a financial institution, except in certain circumstances, from discriminating against a consumer or denying an otherwise qualified consumer a financial product or service, or from offering a financial product or service on less favorable terms and conditions, because the consumer has not provided the express consent. Prescribes the obligations of a financial institution regarding disclosure of a consumer's personal information to affiliates. Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to develop a model disclosure form, meeting specified requirements, for financial institutions to use when seeking a consumer's consent to disclose nonpublic personal information.</summary>
