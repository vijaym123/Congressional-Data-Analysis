Designates as \"covered rules\": (1) the rule entitled \"Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards\"; (2) any rule proposed after March 15, 2012, establishing or revising a standard of performance or emission standard for new stationary sources or hazardous air pollutants that is applicable to petroleum refineries; (3) any rule proposed after March 15, 2012, for implementation of the Renewable Fuel Program under the Clean Air Act; (4) the rules entitled \"National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone\" and \"Reconsideration of the 2008 Ozone Primary and Secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards\" and any subsequent rule revising or supplementing the national ambient air quality standards for ozone; and (5) any successor or substantially similar rules. Defines a \"covered action\" as any action affecting facilities involved in the production, transportation, or distribution of gasoline, diesel fuel, or natural gas taken on or after January 1, 2009, by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a state or local government, or a permitting agency as a result of the application of provisions of the Clean Air Act relating to operating permits or the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality to an air pollutant that is identified as a greenhouse gas in the rule entitled \"Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act.\" Prohibits the Administrator from finalizing the following rules until at least six months after the Committee submits its final report: (1) \"Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards\" and any successor or substantially similar rule; (2) any rule proposed after March 15, 2012, establishing or revising a performance or emission standard for new stationary sources or hazardous air pollutants that is applicable to petroleum refineries; and (3) any rule revising or supplementing the national ambient air quality standards for ozone under the Clean Air Act. Requires the EPA Administrator to consider feasibility and cost in revising or supplementing any such standards for ozone."
