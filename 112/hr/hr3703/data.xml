  <summary>12/16/2011--Introduced.
Fellowships for Undergraduate Training and Useful Research in Energy-related Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Fields Act or FUTURE STEM Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to establish an undergraduate student fellowships pilot program to award competitive grants to specified partner institutions to provide work experience in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields that will improve overall education and training in support of STEM fields. Allows such grants to be used to: (1) employ eligible students for 10-week research fellowships with partner institutions; (2) purchase, rent, or lease equipment, instrumentation, and other educational and training materials needed to satisfy such fellowships; (3) support outreach efforts to recruit students; and (4) encourage collaboration between government, industry, and academic partners. Requires preference to be given in the awarding of such grants to partner institutions whose proposal incorporates E3 concepts. Defines "E3" as the academic and professional area of technological development encompassing the fields of energy, environment, and economy. Requires the Secretary to evaluate the effectiveness of the activities carried out under this Act.</summary>
