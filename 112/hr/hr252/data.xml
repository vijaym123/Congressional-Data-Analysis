Territorial Funding Information Act of 2011 - Requires the head of each federal agency to report to the Comptroller General annually describing federal funds distributed by such agency for the preceding fiscal year, through grant or formula programs or otherwise, to each of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands (territories), each state, and the District of Columbia. Prohibits the distribution of such funds unless in such distribution each of the territories is treated in the same manner as each of the states and the District of Columbia, unless a disparate treatment is authorized by federal law or consented to, in writing,&#160;by the chief executive officer of a territory.</summary>
