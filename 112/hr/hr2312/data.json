Prohibits Federal Prison Industries from: (1) submitting a DOD contract offer for any textile or apparel product reserved for small businesses; and (2) continuing to perform under a contract for a textile or apparel product under its preference, as specified, if, after receiving the award, the work intended to be done by federal prisoners is subsequently subcontracted to another entity. Directs the DOD, upon reducing the quantity of items to be delivered under any indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract for any such product, to reduce Federal Prison Industries' share of the contract by the same percentage that the industry's share is reduced."
