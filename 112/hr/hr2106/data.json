    "text": "Syria Freedom Support Act - Maintains certain U.S. restrictions against the government of Syria and related persons until the President certifies that Syria: (1) has ended support for terrorism; (2) has dismantled biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear weapons programs and has committed to combat their proliferation; (3) respects the boundaries and sovereignty of all neighboring countries; (4) does not pose a threat to U.S. national interest and allies; and (5) upholds human rights and civil liberties. Maintains certain restrictions against the government of Syria based upon its support for international terrorism until the President certifies that Syria: (1) is not engaged in the illegal transfer of missiles or nuclear technology, (2) is not not supporting foreign terrorist organizations, and (3) has ended assistance to insurgents and terrorists in Iraq. Imposes: (1) specified export, financial, procurement, banking, and property sanctions on persons that transfer goods or technology contributing to Syria's biological, chemical, nuclear, or advanced conventional weapons programs; and (2) additional sanctions (including military items and imports) relating to the transfer of nuclear or related weapons technology. Urges the President to begin diplomatic efforts to establish a multilateral sanctions regime against Syria (including limiting the development of petroleum resources) that will inhibit Syria's efforts to support terrorism and develop missile and nuclear capabilities. Imposes specified export, financial, procurement, banking, and property sanctions aimed at Syria's energy sector, including sanctions relating to the development of Syria's petroleum resources and its production and export of refined petroleum products. Terminates such petroleum-related sanctions if the President certifies that Syria: (1) has ended support for terrorism; (2) has dismantled biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear weapons programs and has committed to combat their proliferation; (3) respects the boundaries and sovereignty of all neighboring countries; (4) does not pose a threat to U.S. national interest and allies; and (5) upholds human rights and civil liberties. Amends the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 to: (1) increase the number of sanctions the President must implement against the government of Syria, and (2) eliminate presidential authority to waive such sanctions. Sets forth restrictions on nuclear cooperation with countries assisting Syria's nuclear program. Directs the Secretary of State to deny a visa to, and the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to exclude from the United States, any alien listed in a report identifying persons involved in specified weapons proliferation activities with Syria. Sets forth diplomatic measures intended to isolate the government of Syria. Authorizes the President to provide assistance to support a democratic transition in Syria. States that it shall be U.S. policy to condemn in all appropriate international fora, including the United Nations (U.N.), the government of Syria's violations of internationally recognized human rights. Directs the President to impose admission, financial, and property sanctions on certain Syrian government and military officials responsible for, or complicit in, human rights abuses committed against Syrian citizens or their family members. Directs the President to freeze U.S. or U.S.-controlled assets of a person determined to have been involved in the transfer of goods or technologies to Syria that may be used to commit human rights abuses. Prohibits the Secretary of State from issuing a visa to a person of a country designated as supporting acts of international terrorism if such person: (1) is an agent, instrumentality, or official of the government of Syria; (2) provides material support to Syrian policies; or (3) presents a threat to the United States or who has participated in terrorist acts or is affiliated with terrorist organizations. Terminates the provisions of this Act 30 days after the Secretary certifies that the government of Syria has taken specified actions with respect to: (1) support for terrorism and terrorist organizations; (2) weapons proliferation; (3) relations with neighboring countries; and (4) human rights, political freedom, and democracy."
