Makes a person eligible for a grant under this Act only if such person is a tax-exempt charitable organization and is not a state or local government entity. Prohibits a grant from being used to pay consideration for the purchase of any interest in real property. Limits the amount of a grant to not more than $500,000 per year for five years. Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant under this Act in an amount exceeding more than 50% of the costs such grant is made to assist."
