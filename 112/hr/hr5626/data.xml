Clean and Beautiful Communities Act of 2012 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance Program of the National Park Service (NPS), to make grants to facilitate the acquisition by a qualified organization of a qualified real property interest exclusively for conservation purposes to assist in the funding of the transactional and operational costs associated with the purchase and management of preserved land or a qualified real property interest (including easements) that include: (1) stewardship costs, including costs of standards and practices implementation; (2) land purchase transaction costs; (3) costs of preparing for accreditation associated with land management; and (4) costs of due diligence, including appraisal, title, survey, environmental hazard assessment, and recording costs. Makes a person eligible for a grant under this Act only if such person is a tax-exempt charitable organization and is not a state or local government entity. Prohibits a grant from being used to pay consideration for the purchase of any interest in real property. Limits the amount of a grant to not more than $500,000 per year for five years. Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant under this Act in an amount exceeding more than 50% of the costs such grant is made to assist.</summary>
