Authorizes the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration of the Department of Education to make up to ten grants to or contracts with eligible entities to pay all or part of the cost of special demonstration programs that expand and improve rehabilitation, employment, and other services for adults and youths with disabilities. Authorizes the Assistant Secretary of Education for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services to provide, for FY2012-FY2016, grants to eligible entities to carry out certain activities to help youths between the ages of 14 and 26 with significant disabilities to transition to adulthood. Includes among such activities development and provision of: (1) innovative and effective practices through person-centered planning processes for attaining integrated employment experiences, including customized employment, supported employment services, and employment experiences after school, on weekends, and in the summer months; (2) certain educational-, work-, and family-related objectives and activities based upon the highest expectations of such youths; (3) appropriate and effective curricula and the deployment of professionals with expertise to provide training to school personnel to assist such youths to obtain integrated employment at the greater of minimum or competitive wages; and (4) assistance to such youths and their families to help determine appropriate services under federal and state programs. Limits an eligible entity to one grant or contract during a five-year period. Prohibits the use of grant funds for activities that result in such youths being placed in facility-based segregated services as an employment outcome or post-secondary outcome. Establishes a National Coordination Center on Systems Change and Transformation in the Transition of Youths with Significant Disabilities into Adulthood."
