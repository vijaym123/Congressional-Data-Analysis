Transitioning With an Improved Credential Program Act or TWIC Program Act - Declares that a valid Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) issued before enactment of this Act to a person requiring unescorted access to secure areas of vessels, facilities, and Outer Continental Shelf facilities shall not expire before the earlier of: (1) the deadline for full implementation of a final rule issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) for electronic readers designed to work with TWICs as an access control and security measure; or (2) December 31, 2014. Declares that this Act shall not be construed to affect the Secretary's authority to revoke a TWIC because: (1) a TWIC holder is not qualified to hold it; or (2) the credential is lost, damaged, or stolen.</summary>
