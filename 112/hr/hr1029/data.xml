  <summary>3/10/2011--Introduced.
Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Improvement Act of 2011 - Amends the Energy Employees Occupational Compensation Program Act of 2000 to replace the current requirements for occupational illness compensation to the survivors of a Department of Energy (DOE) contractor employee. Requires payment to a survivor of the compensation the deceased contractor employee would otherwise have been paid, if the employee dies after applying for the compensation but before receiving it. Requires payment of the compensation, if no survivors exist, to a claimant's surviving family members. Requires a survivor eligible for contractor employee compensation under this Act as well as survivor compensation under the regular compensation schedule for survivors to elect one or the other. Prohibits any payment to a survivor of both kinds of compensation.</summary>
