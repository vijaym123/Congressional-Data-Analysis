Requires a tier III sex offender to maintain a clean record for 15 (currently, 25) years to qualify for a reduction in the period for which such offender must keep a sex offender registration current. Allows a jurisdiction to exempt from disclosure through the Internet any information about a sex offender for whom the offense giving rise to the duty to register was one for which the offender was adjudicated delinquent (or otherwise convicted) as a juvenile. Modifies penalty provisions applicable to states that fail to substantially implement sex offender registration and notification requirements under the Adam Walsh Act to require such states to return to the Attorney General for reallocation to other jurisdictions (including local governments) 10% of amounts allocable to those states under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program. Directs the National Institute of Justice to report on the public safety impact, recidivism, and collateral consequences of long-term registration of juvenile sex offenders. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize appropriations through FY2017 for juvenile sex offender treatment grants."
