(Sec. 125) Earmarks specified funds for commencement of the nuclear refueling and complex overhaul of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln during FY2013. (Sec. 126) Directs the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to: (1) designate the effort to develop and produce all variants of the mission modules in support of the littoral combat ship (LCS) program as a major defense acquisition program (MDAP), (2) report to the defense and appropriations committees with respect to the development and production of each variant, and (3) report quarterly to such committees on each variant in support of such ship. (Sec. 127) Directs the Secretary of the Navy to report to the defense and appropriations committees on LCS designs. (Sec. 128) Directs the Comptroller General (CG) to: (1) review Navy compliance with Code of Federal Regulations requirements in accepting the LCS, and (2) report to the defense and appropriations committees on the operational support and sustainment strategy for the LCS program. (Sec. 129) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Navy should take appropriate steps to prioritize early engineering in large ship construction including amphibious class ships beginning with the LHA-8. (Sec. 130) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the deterrence provided by a modern fleet of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines is critical to U.S. national security, (2) the Navy should replace Ohio class submarines with newer submarines, and (3) a minimum of 12 ballistic missile submarines are necessary to provide continuous at-sea deterrence. (Sec. 131) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) DOD should carefully evaluate the maritime force structure necessary to execute demand for forces by the commanders of the combatant commands; (2) the Navy should evaluate amphibious lift capabilities to meet current and projected requirements, and should consider prioritization of investment in and procurement of the next generation of amphibious assault ships; (3) such assault ships should maintain survivability protection; (4) operation and maintenance requirements analysis should be considered to reduce total ownership and acquisition cost; and (5) maintaining a robust amphibious shipbuilding industrial base is vital for the future of U.S. national security. (Sec. 132) Expresses the sense of the Senate that, if the Navy budget for FY2014 includes a request for more than 13 new F-18 aircraft, the FY2014 budget request for F-35 aircraft should include a request for no fewer than six F-35B aircraft and four F-35C aircraft. Subtitle D: Air Force Programs - (Sec. 141) Reduces from 301 to 275 the number of strategic airlift aircraft, effective as of 45 days after the DOD Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) conduct a study of, and report to the defense and appropriations committees on, mobility requirements for all aspects of the National Military Strategy. Requires the Secretary of the Air Force to preserve each C-5 aircraft retired after FY2012 so that such aircraft is stored in a flyable condition, can be returned to service, and is not used to supply parts to other aircraft unless specifically authorized by the Secretary of Defense.

(Sec. 153) Prohibits the obligation of more than 10% of the funds available to the Air Force for FY2013 for the evolved expendable launch vehicle program until the Secretary of the Air Force submits to the defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees: (1) a report describing the program's acquisition strategy; and (2) a certification that such strategy maintains assured access to space, achieves substantial cost savings, and provides opportunities for competition. Requires the CG to review the report and submit results to such committees. (Sec. 154) Prohibits FY2013 DOD funds from being obligated or expended to retire or place in storage an RQ-4 Block 30 Global Hawk unmanned aircraft system.

(Sec. 223) Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to transfer AEGIS weapon system equipment with Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) for installation in the country designated as Host Nation 1. Requires the MDA Director to make a transfer of related equipment to the Navy for the DDG-51 class destroyer program. (Sec. 224) Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of more than 75% of the FY2013 funds for the precision tracking space system until the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation completes and submits to the defense and appropriations committees an evaluation of alternatives to such system. Requires: (1) the MDA Director to enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Commander of the Air Force Space Command with respect to the space situational awareness capabilities, requirements, design, and cost sharing of such system; and (2) the CG to provide to such committees a briefing on evaluation terms of reference and a final report assessing the evaluation. (Sec. 225) Requires the MDA Director to: (1) develop a long-term plan for the Exo-atmospheric kill vehicle for the ground-based interceptor and any other interceptor that might be developed against long-range ballistic missiles, and (2) report to the defense and appropriations committees on such plan. (Sec. 226) Directs the Secretary of the Army to submit to such committees a modernization plan of the Patriot air and missile defense system and related systems of the integrated air and missile defense architecture. (Sec. 227) Directs the Secretary to conduct a study evaluating at least three possible additional U.S. locations for future deployment of an interceptor capable of protecting against threats from nations such as North Korea and Iran, requiring accompanying environmental impacts. Requires the MDA Director to: (1) develop a contingency plan for an additional interceptor site in case the President decides to proceed with an additional deployment, and (2) notify the defense and appropriations committees when such plan has been developed. (Sec. 228) Expresses the sense of Congress: (1) for a national priority of defending the United States against the potential future threat of limited ballistic missile attack; (2) in favor of the currently deployed ground-based midcourse defense (GBMD) system to provide such defense, assuming appropriate levels of sustainability and performance; (3) that the MDA should correct problems discovered in GBMD flight tests; and (4) that DOD should continue to evaluate the evolving threat of limited ballistic missile attack, particularly from countries such as North Korea and Iran, and consider other possibilities for affordable and effective steps to improve the posture of the United States to defend itself. Requires: (1) a report from the Secretary to the defense and appropriations committees on the status of efforts to improve U.S. homeland missile defense capability, and (2) a briefing of such committees by the CG with respect to such report. (Sec. 229) Expresses the sense of Congress that : (1) the threat from regional ballistic missiles, particularly from Iran and North Korea, is serious and growing, and puts at risk forward-deployed U.S. forces and allies and partners in Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region; (2) DOD has an obligation to protect all such forces; (3) the European Phased Adaptive Approach is an appropriate and necessary response to such threat; (4) DOD should continue to test and plan to deploy all four phases of such Approach, as well as other phased and adaptive regional missile defense efforts; and (5) European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are making valuable contributions toward European missile defense. Requires: (1) a report from the Secretary to the defense and appropriations committees on the status and progress of regional missile defense programs and efforts, and (2) a briefing of such committees by the CG with respect to such report. (Sec. 230) Directs the Secretary to report to such committees on: (1) contributions of NATO members to missile defense in Europe, and (2) the testing program for the GBMD element of the BMD system. Requires a CG briefing with respect to the latter report. (Sec. 232) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it is U.S. policy to deploy as soon as possible an effective national missile defense system capable of defending the United States against limited ballistic missile attack; (2) further limitations on missile defense capabilities are not in the U.S. national security interests; (3) the New Start Treaty and statements by the Russian Federation do not limit, and should not be interpreted as limiting, current plans to protect the United States or its Armed Forces and allies from such attack; (4) any additional defensive limitations may enter into force only with the advice and consent of the Senate; and (5) the Arms Control and Disarmament Act requires that no action shall be taken that would obligate the United States to reduce or limit its Armed Forces or armaments in a militarily significant manner, except pursuant to the treaty-making power of the President. (Sec. 233) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should comply with requirements of the previous National Defense Authorization Act and submit to Congress a homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report.
