Instructs that the report: (1) include a discussion on the effect of the designation of the area to be studied on existing commercial and recreational activities, the construction, operation, or improvement of energy production and transmission, and the authority of state and local governments to manage all such activities; and (2) identify authorities that will influence local land use decisions or place restrictions on non-federal land if the study area is designated, identify authorities that may be used to condemn property if the study area is designated, and identify all private property located in the study area."
