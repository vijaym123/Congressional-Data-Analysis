Nashua River Wild and Scenic River Study Act - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain segments concerning the Nashua River and its tributaries in Massachusetts for study for potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to complete a study of the Nashua River in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and to report to Congress. Instructs that the report: (1) include a discussion on the effect of the designation of the area to be studied on existing commercial and recreational activities, the construction, operation, or improvement of energy production and transmission, and the authority of state and local governments to manage all such activities; and (2) identify authorities that will influence local land use decisions or place restrictions on non-federal land if the study area is designated, identify authorities that may be used to condemn property if the study area is designated, and identify all private property located in the study area.</summary>
