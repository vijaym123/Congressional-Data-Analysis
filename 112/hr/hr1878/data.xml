  <summary>5/12/2011--Introduced.
Requires the same right of access to public transportation, accommodations, and private entity transportation services to be afforded to licensed or certified trainers of service animals (or appropriately credentialed handlers such animals) as is afforded under specified provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to individuals with disabilities who use such service animals. Declares it discriminatory under the ADA to afford such a trainer, when accompanied by a service animal, with any service, facility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation that is unequal to that afforded to other individuals. Defines "service animal" as a guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained or being trained to assist a disabled individual and distinguished by wearing a collar, leash, harness, or cape identifying the animal as a service animal in training, regardless of whether such animal has been licensed or certified by a state or local government.</summary>
