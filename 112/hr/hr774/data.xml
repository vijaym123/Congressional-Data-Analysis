Senior Investor Protections Enhancement Act of 2011 - Amends the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to impose, in addition to any other civil penalty, a maximum civil penalty of $50,000 for each violation that is directed toward, targets, or is committed against a person who at the time of the violation is age 62 or older. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to review and amend federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements to ensure that guideline offense levels and enhancements appropriately punish criminal violations of the securities laws against seniors.</summary>
