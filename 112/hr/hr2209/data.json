    "text": "Forest Service Administrative Review Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), through the Forest Service, to establish a pre-decisional administrative review process that will serve as the sole means by which persons can seek an administrative review regarding proposed actions of the Forest Service concerning projects and activities that implement land and resource management plans developed under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. Sets forth requirements for the pre-decisional administrative review process concerning the occurrence of the review period, eligibility of a participant in the process, and notice of the proposed decision. Exempts from such process an emergency situation that exists for which immediate implementation of a proposed action is necessary. Applies certain judicial review provisions of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 with respect to: (1) the judicial review of an action challenging a proposed action under this Act, and (2) any request for an injunction regarding such an action. Makes this Act non-applicable to: (1) an authorized hazardous fuel reduction project under such Act that has its own special administrative review process, and (2) a proposed action under this Act for which a categorical exclusion is provided."
