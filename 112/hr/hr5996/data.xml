  <summary>6/21/2012--Introduced.
Mental Health First Aid Higher Education Act of 2012 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, to carry out a demonstration program awarding grants to 10 institutions of higher education (IHEs) to implement a mental health first aid training program. Directs that training toward: (1) on-campus counseling center personnel; (2) dormitory resident advisers; (3) members of threat assessment and disciplinary committees; (4) faculty members; (5) coaches and other athletic department employees; (6) members of threat assessment teams; and (7) other administrators and personnel of the IHE, as determined appropriate by the Secretary. Requires that the program be designed to train those individuals to: (1) safely ameliorate crisis situations, (2) recognize the signs and symptoms of mental illness, and (3) refer students to mental health services in the early stages of developing mental disorders so they can avoid more costly behavioral health care down the road and stay enrolled in school.</summary>
