  <summary>6/22/2011--Introduced.
Directs the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to: (1) study ways to provide independent, confirming genetic diagnostic test activity where gene patents and exclusive licensing for primary genetic diagnostic tests exist; and (2) report the findings to Congress within nine months along with recommendations for establishing the availability of such independent confirming genetic diagnostic test activity. Defines &#147;confirming genetic diagnostic test activity&#148; as the performance of a genetic diagnostic test, by a genetic diagnostic test provider, on an individual solely for the purpose of providing the individual with an independent confirmation of results obtained from another test provider&#146;s prior performance of the test on the individual.</summary>
