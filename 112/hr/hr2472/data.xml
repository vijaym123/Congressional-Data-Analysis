  <summary>7/8/2011--Introduced.
Health Care Professionals Protection Act of 2011 - Amends the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 to prohibit a health care entity from submitting a report to the National Practitioner Data Bank on a professional review action that would adversely affect a physician's clinical privileges while the physician is under investigation before adequate notice of and hearing procedures for such action and investigation or such other procedures as are fair are afforded to the physician. Applies such prohibition to permissive reporting to the Board of Medical Examiners for a licensed health care practitioner who is not a physician. Requires a health care entity to provide a physician with copies of all evidence expected to be offered against the physician in any hearing on a professional review action.</summary>
