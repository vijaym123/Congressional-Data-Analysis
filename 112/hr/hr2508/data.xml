  <summary>7/13/2011--Introduced.
Declares that, for mortgages originated during FY2012 and FY2013, if the dollar amount limit on the maximum original principal obligation of a mortgage that may be purchased by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) for any size residence for any area is less than the limit in effect for 2008 under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, the maximum dollar amount limit on the principal obligation of such a mortgage shall be such maximum limit in effect for 2008 (in effect, an increase in the limit on the maximum original mortgage principal obligation from the FY2012 or FY2013 level to the 2008 level). Makes a similar declaration (and mortgage principal limit increase), for mortgages for which the mortgagee issues credit approval during FY2012 and FY2013, about the dollar amount limit on the maximum original principal obligation of a mortgage that may be insured by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</summary>
