  <summary>2/28/2012--Introduced.
Bring the Jobs Home Loan Act of 2012 - Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish a loan program to assist small businesses involved in manufacturing to begin the U.S. production of products that would otherwise be imported. Requires small businesses receiving such loans to report to the Administrator on: (1) facility and equipment changes made, or training provided, using such loans; and (2) progress made in such production. Allows the Administrator to consider such report information in determining whether to provide an additional loan or loan assistance under another SBA program. Prohibits an individual loan greater than 5% of the total amount available for such loans.</summary>
