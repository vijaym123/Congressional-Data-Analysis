Amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to: (1) provide that no rule, order, or other administrative action of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection&#160;shall be considered final if the Director of the Bureau was appointed during a recess of the Senate and the position of Director&#160;was vacant while the Senate was in session, until the Director has been confirmed by the Senate; (2) prohibit payment for services&#160;to any person appointed to the Bureau during a recess of the Senate to fill a vacancy in the Bureau requiring Senate confirmation, if the vacancy existed while the Senate was in session, until such&#160;appointee is confirmed by the&#160;Senate; and (3) prohibit an employee or officer&#160;of the Bureau serving in a position&#160;that requires Senate confirmation from providing voluntary or gratuitous services.</summary>
