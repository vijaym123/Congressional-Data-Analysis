Requires such land to be considered and evaluated as an on-reservation acquisition and become part of the Tribe's reservation. (Off-reservation land acquisition requests require the Secretary to give greater scrutiny to the tribe's justification of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition.) Prohibits gaming on lands taken into trust pursuant to this Act."
