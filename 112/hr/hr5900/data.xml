  <summary>6/6/2012--Introduced.
Allows any fire department with a service area that comprises all territory, population, and housing units in rural areas or outside a city or town with a population of less than 20,000 people to apply for a federal grant for which it would otherwise be eligible regardless of whether it has completed the National Incident Management System (NIMS) training. Requires any such department that receives a grant to complete such training by the end of the period covered by the grant award. Allows the department to claim the cost of such training as an allowable cost under the grant.</summary>
