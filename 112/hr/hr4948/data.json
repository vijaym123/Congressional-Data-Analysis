Provides FY2012-FY2017 compensation for losses to eligible livestock producers for livestock grazing losses due to specified drought or fire circumstances. Excludes from coverage grazing losses on conservation reserve program land used for haying or grazing. Provides FY2012-FY2017 emergency relief to eligible producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish to reduce losses due to disease, adverse weather, or other conditions, such as blizzards and wildfires."
