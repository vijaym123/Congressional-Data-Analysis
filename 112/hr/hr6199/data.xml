Preserving American Privacy Act of 2012 - Prohibits a federal agency from authorizing the domestic use of an unmanned aircraft for law enforcement purposes or for surveillance of a U.S. national or real property owned by that national, including by any state or local government, except pursuant to warrant and in the investigation of a felony. Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit a federal agency other than a federal law enforcement agency from using in the United States, or authorizing any federal officer or employee to use in the United States, an unmanned aircraft for such purposes, with the same exceptions. Prohibits the use of any information obtained in violation of such prohibition in a criminal proceeding before a federal court. Subjects the domestic use of an unmanned aircraft to the same limitations and exceptions as apply in the case of any other search. Prohibits evidence obtained by an agency using an unmanned aircraft from being introduced in an administrative hearing. Prohibits a federal agency from authorizing the domestic use of an unmanned aircraft to permit any private person to conduct surveillance on any other private person without the consent of that other person or the owner of any real property on which that other person is present.</summary>
