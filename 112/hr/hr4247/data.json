    "text": "Cell Phone Theft Prevention Act of 2012 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a provider of commercial mobile or commercial mobile data service from providing service on a mobile electronic device reported to such provider as stolen by: (1) the person who holds the service account, if such person submits a copy of a report made to a law enforcement agency regarding the theft; or (2) another provider of commercial mobile or commercial mobile data service required by this Act to inform all other providers of a device reported stolen and of any information necessary for identification of the device. Defines \"mobile electronic device\" as a personal electronic device on which commercial mobile or commercial mobile data service is provided, excluding devices: (1) for which the consumer purchases service by paying in advance for a specified amount of calling or data usage, or (2) with respect to which the consumer does not have a direct relationship with the provider. Directs providers to make available to account holders the capability of deleting, from a remote location, all information that was placed on such a device after its manufacture. Prohibits a person from manufacturing in or importing into the United States for sale or resale to the public a mobile electronic device unless it is: (1) equipped with a unique identifier that allows a provider to identify such device, and (2) configured to enable a provider to make available the remote deletion capability required by this Act."
