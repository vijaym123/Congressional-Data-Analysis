Expediting Agriculture Through Science Act or EATS Act - Amends the Plant Protection Act to include biotechnology products among the plant pests that a person may petition the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to have added or removed from regulations allowing such products' importation, entry, exportation, or movement in interstate commerce without a permit. Revises provisions regarding the Secretary's response to such a petition to require the Secretary to: (1) determine whether to approve such petition not later than 180 days after the petition's receipt, with two permitted 30-day extensions; (2) notify the petitioner of such extensions; and (3) provide a denied petitioner with denial information and an opportunity to remedy deficiencies. Deems a petition approved if the Secretary has not made a determination to approve the petition by the end of the 240-day period beginning on the date of the petition's receipt.</summary>
