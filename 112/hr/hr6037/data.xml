  <summary>6/27/2012--Introduced.
Small Business Lending for Jobs Act of 2012 - Directs federal banking agencies to focus upon: (1) facilitating credit availability to customers of insured depository institutions, and (2) using regulatory policies and procedures that promote credit availability in a safe and sound manner in order to assist insured depository institutions to provide such credit and thus encourage business development and employment. Prohibits federal banking agencies from requiring or pressuring insured depository institutions to provide particular kinds of credit or on particular terms. Directs each federal banking agency to report to Congress an implementation plan addressing such foci. Establishes the Credit Availability Council to coordinate federal banking agency efforts in facilitating credit availability to insured depository institution customers. Authorizes an insured depository institution with assets of less than $10 billion, for purposes of capital calculation under the Financial Institutions Examination Council's Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, to choose to amortize any loss or write-down, on a quarterly straight-line basis over a seven-year period, which it has incurred with respect to: (1) a loan secured by commercial real estate, or (2) other real estate owned. Directs the federal banking agencies to promulgate regulations permitting an insured depository institution to include all of its allowance for loan and lease losses when computing capital for purposes of satisfying risk-based capital requirements.</summary>
