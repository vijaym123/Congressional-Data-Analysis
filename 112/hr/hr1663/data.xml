  <summary>4/15/2011--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow certain small businesses with gross receipts in the preceding taxable year not exceeding $20 million a work opportunity tax credit for hiring individuals who have been receiving state unemployment compensation for not less than 4 weeks in the 1-year period ending on the hiring date. Increases the amount of wages eligible for such credit from $6,000 to $12,000 for the hiring of individuals in a high unemployment zone (a county that has an unemployment rate exceeding the greater of 4% or the national unemployment rate). Terminates such credit after December 31, 2013.</summary>
