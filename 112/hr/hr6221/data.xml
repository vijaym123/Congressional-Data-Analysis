Directs the Secretary to ensure that information relating to such risks is: (1) disseminated, to the maximum extent possible, in an unclassified version, to owners and operators of critical infrastructure within each such sector; or (2) if the information in whole or in part should be classified, share such information with owners and operators who possess the appropriate security clearances. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress at least semiannually on cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure.</summary>
