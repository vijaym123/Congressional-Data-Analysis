Exempts a creditor with less than $1 billion in assets from: (1) this requirement when the consumer credit transaction has an annual percentage rate exceeding the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set by 1.5 or more percentage points; and (2) any other provision of such Act that requires the creditor to establish an escrow or impound account with respect to such a transaction."
