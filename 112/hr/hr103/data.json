Directs the Secretary to establish the MAV Program, under which a voucher may be used as a contribution into a health savings account and for the payment of enrollment premiums under a high deductible health plan. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the amount of the itemized deduction for health savings accounts by the amount of the MAV that is contributed to an individual's health savings account. Suspends Medicare late enrollment penalties for an individual between ages 65 and 70."
