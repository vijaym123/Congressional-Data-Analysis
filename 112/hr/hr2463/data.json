Changes the termination date for DHS's Homeland Security Science and Technology Advisory Committee to December 31, 2014.Directs the Comptroller General to assess the basic science research needs in the border and maritime security domain.Requires: (1) the Secretary of DHS and the Director of the Joint Planning and Development Office to continue to research and develop technologies to permit routine operation of unmanned aerial vehicles, including autonomously piloted drones, within the national airspace for border and maritime security missions without any degradation of existing levels of safety for all national airspace system users; (2) the Secretary to coordinate with the Director to enter into pilot projects in designated test ranges in sparsely populated, low-density air traffic airspace to conduct research, experiments, and data collection in order to accelerate the safe integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system as part of that Office's research activities; (3) the Under Secretary to continue to research and develop technologies to permit detection of near surface voids, such as tunnels, with an emphasis on technologies with real time capability; and (4) the Secretary to coordinate with other federal agencies and ensure the integration of such activities with relevant efforts of such other agencies and DHS's Centers of Excellence Program.Directs the Under Secretary, in coordination with: (1) the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to continue a joint research and development program on anti-counterfeit technologies and standards; and (2) the Commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to continue research on the use of mobile biometric technology at the nation's borders between the ports of entry."
