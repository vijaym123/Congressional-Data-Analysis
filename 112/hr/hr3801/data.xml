  <summary>2/10/2012--Public Law.
Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act of 2012 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 with respect to aviation smuggling to extend its coverage of aircraft to: (1) any contrivance invented, used, or designed to navigate, or fly in, the air; and (2) ultralight vehicles. Subjects attempts or conspiracies to commit aviation smuggling to specified criminal penalties. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense (DOD) should continue the broad program of cooperation with the Secretary of Homeland Security to identify DOD equipment, technology, and expertise that could be leveraged by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to fulfill its missions. Urges DOD especially to ensure that DHS can identify DOD equipment and technology that could also be used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to combat illicit trafficking across the international borders between the United States and Mexico and the United States and Canada, including any that could be used to detect and track the illicit use of ultralight aircraft.</summary>
