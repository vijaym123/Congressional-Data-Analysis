Requires the Council to submit to the FCC and Congress recommendations on how to: (1) promote reliable 9-1-1 services, E9-1-1 services, and Next Generation 9-1-1 services and extend next generation capabilities to other services using abbreviated dialing codes; (2) make broadband networks, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) systems, and other communications networks more secure, resilient, and defendable against Internet-based attacks; (3) leverage advanced technologies and the Internet to distribute emergency alerts and warnings to the public; and (4) improve priority services programs related to national security and emergency preparedness, including Government Emergency Telecommunications Service, Telecommunications Service Priority, and Wireless Priority Service. Directs the Council to include with such recommendations a summary of the greatest and growing threats to the security of communications networks and an itemization of any statutory or regulatory obstacles. Prohibits this Act from being construed as a grant of authority to the FCC to adopt rules or regulations imposing binding obligations on businesses or consumers."
