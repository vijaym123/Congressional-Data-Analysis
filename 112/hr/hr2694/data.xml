  <summary>7/29/2011--Introduced.
Medicare Firewall Act of 2011 - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, to defund as of the end of FY2011: (1) the convening of multi-stakeholder groups for input into the selection of health care quality measures, (2) the Independence at Home Demonstration Program, (3) the Community-Based Care Transitions Program, (4) the demonstration project on separate payments under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act for complex diagnostic laboratory tests, (5) outreach and assistance for specified state and local low-income programs, (6) the Independent Medicare Advisory Board, (7) evaluation of community-based prevention and wellness programs, and (8) the pilot program for care of certain individuals residing in emergency declaration areas. Restores to the Medicare Trust Funds unobligated amounts that were originally transferred from them for such programs and activities. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to report to Congress on demonstration, pilot, or similar projects undertaken with funding from any of the Medicare Trust Funds, especially those for which the initial period of the project has: (1) not demonstrated that the project has met its objectives, or (2) resulted in net expenditures from the Medicare Trust Funds. Requires the Secretary to include with this report a plan for termination or modification of each such project.</summary>
