North Korean Child Welfare Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of State to designate a representative to regularly brief Congress on U.S. efforts to advocate for the best interests of North Korean children and children of one North Korean parent, including efforts to address the adoption of such children living outside North Korea without parental care. Directs such designee to address the Department of State's: (1) analysis of the challenges facing North Korean children residing outside North Korea and challenges facing children of one North Korean parent in other countries who are fleeing persecution or are living as de jure or de facto stateless persons (such North Korean children); (2) efforts to advocate for the best interest of such North Korean children, including family reunification efforts and the adoption of North Korean children living outside North Korea and children of one North Korean parent living outside North Korea; (3) efforts to address challenges that U.S. citizens would encounter in attempting to adopt such North Korean children, including efforts to overcome the complexities involved in best interest determinations and adoption processing of those who habitually reside in a Hague country or a non-Hague country; (4) diplomatic efforts to encourage countries in which North Korean children or children of one North Korean parent are fleeing persecution or reside as de jure or de facto stateless persons to resolve issues of statelessness of North Koreans residing in that country; and (5) efforts to work with the Republic of Korea to establish pilot programs that assist in the family reunification of North Korean children and children of one North Korean parent living within South Korea and other countries who are fleeing persecution or are living as de jure or de facto stateless persons.</summary>
