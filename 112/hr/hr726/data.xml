States that: (1) the Secretary shall treat all applications to take land into trust within the boundaries of the original 1857 reservation as an on-reservation trust acquisition, and (2) all real property taken into trust within those boundaries after September 9, 1988, shall be part of the Tribe's reservation.</summary>
