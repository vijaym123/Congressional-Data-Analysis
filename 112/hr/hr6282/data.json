Requires the Secretary to determine the fair market value of the federal land based on an appraisal according to nationally recognized appraisal standards. Permits the city to pay or reimburse the Secretary, as appropriate, for reasonable transaction and administrative personnel costs associated with such conveyance, including the costs of appraisal, title searches, maps, and boundary and cadastral surveys. Prohibits a conveyance or combination of conveyances under this Act from being considered a major federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Releases the United States from all liabilities or claims of any kind or nature arising from the presence, release, or threat of release of any hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, petroleum product (or derivative of a petroleum product) solid waste, mine materials, or mining related features existing on the federal land."
