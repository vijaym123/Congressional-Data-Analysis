Enhanced Supply and Price Reduction Act of 2011 or Enhanced SPR Act - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to include refined petroleum products within its required capacity of 1 billion barrels of petroleum products. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to sell at least 30 million barrels of petroleum from the SPR and acquire refined petroleum product. Prescribes a schedule for such transactions. Directs the Secretary to deposit the cash proceeds from such sales into the SPR Petroleum Account.
