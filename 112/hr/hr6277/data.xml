  <summary>8/2/2012--Introduced.
Keep America Secure Act - Prohibits the Secretary of Defense (DOD) and the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) from purchasing equipment or military aircraft containing non-U.S. manufactured electronic components. Allows the Secretaries to waive the application of such prohibition respecting such a purchase if it is determined that such application would be inconsistent with the public interest or would result in unreasonable costs to DOD or DHS. Directs the Secretaries to jointly establish a classification system for electronic components be based on how sensitive the components, and the final products containing such components, are to national security. Requires the Secretaries to jointly study the prevalence of counterfeit electronic components in the supply chains of DOD and DHS and options for addressing such issue.</summary>
