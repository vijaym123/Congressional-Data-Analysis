Prohibits the Secretary from considering sound produced by sources other than commercial air tour operations when: (1) making recommendations, developing a final plan, or issuing regulations related to commercial air tour operations in the Park; or (2) determining whether substantial restoration of the natural quiet and experience of the Park has been achieved. Requires the Secretary to continuously monitor noise from aircraft operating over the Park below 17,999 feet MSL to ensure compliance with such substantial restoration in the Park."
