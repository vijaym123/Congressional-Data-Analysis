Requires, if a forfeited vessel is not transferred to or utilized by the Commandant for such exercises, that the forfeited vessel be transferred to or otherwise under the control of the Commandant, the Administrator of the Maritime Administration, or the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere of the Department of Commerce, and be: (1) scrapped or recycled; (2) sold or donated to a developing nation for fisheries enforcement; or (3) donated to a not-for-profit institution or governmental agency for education, research, or other public interest purposes with an agreement that the vessel will never be utilized for illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing or related activities. Defines a \"forfeited vessel\" as a foreign or stateless vessel forfeited to the United States for engaging in specified illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing under any of the living marine resource statutes implemented by the Secretary of Commerce. Applies this Act to all forfeited vessels surrendered or seized and forfeited after September 1, 2011."
