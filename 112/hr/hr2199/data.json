Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to notify the chief law enforcement officer of the state and of the local jurisdiction in which an alien who has been detained by the United States is released. Defines \"alien\" as an individual who: (1) is listed in the most recent quarterly report, or (2) has received a final order of removal and has not been removed from the United States."
