  <summary>5/5/2011--Introduced.
Preserving Equal Access to Mortgage Finance Programs Act - Amends the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act and the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act to increase limitations on the maximum original principal obligation of mortgages that may purchased by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Association (Freddie Mac). Increases such limitations in areas where 125% (currently, 115%) of the median price of residences of a particular size exceed existing mortgage purchase limitations for such residence size. Gives the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) discretion to prevent or limit a decrease in the limitation on the maximum original principal obligation of a mortgage that may be purchased by the corporation for an area. Amends the National Housing Act to raise limitations on the maximum principal obligation of mortgages that may be insured by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Gives the Secretary discretion to prevent or limit a decrease in the maximum dollar amount limitation for any area from taking place for any such area.</summary>
