Eliminates the authority for pilot demonstration projects to purchase and implement the use of advanced diagnostic medical equipment to analyze real-time clinical specimens for pathogens of public health or bioterrorism significance. Revises and reauthorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2016 for a grant program to improve hospital surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness for public health emergencies. Expands the purpose of the program to address the needs of pediatric and other at-risk populations. Requires the Secretary to implement metrics to ensure the entities receiving awards under the program are meeting, to the extent practicable, the goals of the National Health Security Strategy.

Reauthorizes appropriations to the special reserve fund (Biodefense Countermeasures' appropriations account) for FY2014-FY2018 for procurement of security countermeasures and for countermeasure advanced research and development under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Prohibits amounts in the special reserve fund from being used to pay: (1) costs other than payments made by the Secretary to a vendor for advanced development or for procurement of a security countermeasure, or (2) any administrative expenses. Requires a contract to procure security countermeasures to include a clear statement of defined government purpose limited to uses related to a security countermeasure. Reauthorizes the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Health Professions Volunteers (ESAR-VHP) for FY2012-FY2016, which provides a single national interoperable network of systems to verify the credentials and licenses of health care professionals who volunteer to provide health services during a public health emergency. Revises and reauthorizes for FY2012-FY2016 the Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Development Fund used to support BARDA to accelerate countermeasure and product advanced research and development. Requires the Secretary to provide a clear statement of defined government purpose related to BARDA activities for the awarding of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements for a qualified countermeasure or qualified pandemic or epidemic product. Extends the the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemption for specific technical data or scientific information that is created or obtained during countermeasure and product advanced research and development carried out under the PHSA that reveals significant and not otherwise known vulnerabilities of existing medical or public health defenses against biological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological threats.

(Sec. 4) Requires the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness to: (1) identify gaps, duplication, and other inefficiencies in public health preparedness activities and the actions necessary to overcome these obstacles; (2) lead the development of a coordinated Countermeasure Implementation Plan; (3) oversee the development of a five-year budget analysis; and (4) coordinate HHS grant programs relating to medical and public health preparedness capabilities and the activities of local communities to respond to public health emergencies.

Permits medical countermeasures to be dispensed without a prescription during an actual emergency in accordance with state law or an order issued by the Secretary.

(Sec. 9) Requires the Secretary to expand the involvement of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) personnel in interagency activities with the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Department of Defense (DOD) for the purpose of accelerating the development, stockpiling, approval, clearance, and licensure of countermeasures and pandemic or epidemic products. Directs the Secretary to establish a process for frequent scientific feedback and interactions between the FDA and security countermeasure sponsors to facilitate the approval, clearance, and licensing of security countermeasures. Requires such process to allow for the development of a written regulatory management plan for a security countermeasure. Requires the Secretary to provide final guidance to industry within one year after enactment of this Act regarding the development of animal models to support approval, clearance, or licensure of countermeasures and epidemic and pandemic products when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. Revises provisions governing special protocol assessments to include agreements on the design and size of animal efficacy trials and any associated clinical trials that, in combination, are intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim for a countermeasure or epidemic or pandemic product when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible."
