Eliminates the authority for pilot demonstration projects to purchase and implement the use of advanced diagnostic medical equipment to analyze real-time clinical specimens for pathogens of public health or bioterrorism significance. Revises and reauthorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2016 for a grant program to improve hospital surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness for public health emergencies. Expands the purpose of the program to address the needs of pediatric and other at-risk populations.

Prohibits amounts in the special reserve fund from being used to pay: (1) costs other than payments made by the Secretary to a vendor for advanced development or for procurement of a security countermeasure, or (2) any administrative expenses. Requires a contract to procure security countermeasures to include a clear statement of defined government purpose limited to uses related to a security countermeasure.

Revises and reauthorizes for FY2012-FY2016 the Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Development Fund used to support BARDA to accelerate countermeasure and product advanced research and development. Requires the Secretary to provide a clear statement of defined government purpose related to BARDA activities for the awarding of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements for a qualified countermeasure or qualified pandemic or epidemic product. Extends the the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemption for specific technical data or scientific information that is created or obtained during countermeasure and product advanced research and development carried out under the PHSA that reveals significant and not otherwise known vulnerabilities of existing medical or public health defenses against biological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological threats.
