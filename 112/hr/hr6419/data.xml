  <summary>9/14/2012--Introduced.
America Votes Act of 2012 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to permit an individual required to present identification as a condition for voting in a federal election to meet the requirement by presenting the appropriate state or local election official with an affidavit, signed by the individual under penalty of perjury, attesting to the individual's identification and that he or she is registered to vote in the election. Allows an individual desiring to vote by mail to submit such an affidavit with the ballot. Prohibits a state from requiring an individual who presents or submits such an affidavit to cast a provisional ballot in the election. Excepts first-time voters registering by mail from application of this Act. Requires states requiring an individual to present identification as a condition of receiving and casting a ballot in a federal election to include the use of an affidavit in voting information posted at polling places.</summary>
