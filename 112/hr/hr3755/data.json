(Current law only prohibits such demonstrations on property of a cemetery under the control of the National Cemetery Administration or on the property of Arlington National Cemetery.) Extends to 1,000 feet the distance within which certain demonstrations that impede access to or egress from such a cemetery or property are prohibited during the period beginning 60 minutes before and ending 60 minutes after such a service, provided that there is a visible sign at applicable distances stating the time interval during which a service will be held."
