Requires that a party to an administrative proceeding have the same right to retain such a structured settlement broker for negotiations with other parties. Directs: (1) the court or the agency in an administrative proceeding to inform the claimant of this right at the appropriate time, and (2) the defendant to provide timely notice of any current or previous professional relationship between the defendant and the broker."
