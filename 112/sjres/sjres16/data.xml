  <summary>5/25/2011--Introduced.
Declares that, as it pertains to the continuing armed engagement of the U.S. Armed Forces against the government of Libya, the President has exceeded the statutory time limits in the War Powers Resolution and is therefore in violation of the law. Calls on the President to seek a formal authorization from Congress to continue the mission in Libya and cease armed engagement against the government of Libya until further action is authorized by Congress.</summary>
