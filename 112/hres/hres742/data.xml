Urges Russia to: (1) end weapons transfers to the Assad regime; (2) call on the Assad regime to end all violence against civilians; (3) support international sanctions against Syria; and (4) support a peaceful transition of Syrian government leadership, starting with the early departure of Bashar al-Assad.</summary>
