  <summary>4/16/2012--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that U.S. policy toward China should be guided by the following strategic objectives to: (1) deploy defense and intelligence capabilities to resist any force or coercion that would jeopardize the peace of the Asia-Pacific region and the security of U.S. friends and allies; (2) treat Taiwan in strict accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, the three United States-People's Republic of China Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances; (3) pursue a diversified U.S. economy as the surest means of providing for leverage in interactions with China; (4) deploy counterintelligence capabilities to protect U.S. national security in the face of significant Chinese espionage efforts; (5) prevent the transfer of technology, intellectual property, or equipment that would substantially contribute to Chinese military or space capabilities; (6) encourage China to utilize its economic, political, and military power to contribute to the international system; (7) encourage China to support political reform and religious freedom; (8) encourage the peaceful resolution of maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea; and (9) convey to China that responsible behavior will create the possibility for a genuine U.S. partnership on matters of mutual interest, while unacceptable behavior will incur costs that would outweigh any gains.</summary>
