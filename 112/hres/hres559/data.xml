  <summary>2/17/2012--Introduced.
Calls on Egypt to: (1) without delay, release the U.S. citizens who are nongovernmental organization employees facing politically motivated charges; (2) return all assets and funds that have been seized from the nongovernmental organizations and U.S. citizens; and (3) allow the nongovernmental organizations to continue working to promote a free and democratic Egypt. Calls on the Secretary of State to withhold assistance to Egypt if the U.S. citizens are not released. Calls on Egypt to comply with international human rights standards. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that U.S. assistance for Egypt should not be allocated if the government of Egypt continues to retain U.S. and other foreign citizens and work against the pursuit of democracy.</summary>
