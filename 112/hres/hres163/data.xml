  <summary>3/10/2011--Introduced.
Declares that all private and public sector workers must have a basic right to organize and bargain collectively for a fair and just outcome. Supports the rights of workers, including their right to form a union and to bargain collectively in good faith with an employer. Urges Americans to work towards cessation of the constant attacks on workers and recognize that a strong middle class is the only way to ensure the United States remains a strong economic engine.</summary>
