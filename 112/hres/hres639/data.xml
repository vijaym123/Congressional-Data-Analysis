  <summary>4/27/2012--Introduced.
Urges the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to: (1) work within the framework of the U.N. process with Greece to achieve long-standing U.S. and U.N. policy goals by finding a mutually acceptable official name, for all uses, for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; and (2) abstain from hostile activities and stop violating provisions of the U.N.-brokered Interim Agreement between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece regarding hostile activities or propaganda. Urges the U.S. government to work in partnership with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies to extend an invitation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached within the U.N. framework.</summary>
