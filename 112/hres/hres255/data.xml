  <summary>11/4/2011--Reported to House without amendment.
Urges the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) respond to any modification of passenger name record (PNR) data sharing that degrades the ability to identify terrorists with stronger security requirements, (2) not enter into any agreement that would impose European oversight structures on the United States, and (3) oppose any effort by the European Union to frustrate counterterrorism cooperation and information sharing between DHS and non-European countries.</summary>
