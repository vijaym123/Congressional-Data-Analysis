Condemns: (1) Syria's intimidation and violence towards journalists, videographers, and bloggers; and (2) nations that assist Syria's media repression. Pays tribute to the journalists who have lost their lives while reporting on the conflict in Syria and commends the courage of journalists who continue to operate in harm's way. Supports the people of Syria seeking a free flow of accurate news and other forms of information. Reaffirms the centrality of press freedom to U.S. efforts to support democracy around the world."
