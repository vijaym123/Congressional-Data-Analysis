  <summary>1/5/2011--Introduced.
Declares the sense of the House of Representatives that, in order to keep energy costs affordable, curb our environmental impact, and safeguard economic prosperity, including our trade deficit, the United States must move rapidly to: (1) increase the productivity with which it uses fossil fuel; and (2) accelerate the transition to renewable fuels and a sustainable, clean energy economy. Urges the United States, in collaboration with other international allies, to establish an energy project with the magnitude, creativity, and sense of urgency of the "Man on the Moon" project to develop a comprehensive plan to address the challenges presented by Peak Oil.</summary>
