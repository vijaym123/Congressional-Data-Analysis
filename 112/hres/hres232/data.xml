  <summary>4/15/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should: (1) work to inform members of the U.N. General Assembly of Judge Goldstone's reconsideration of his own report and admission of its deeply flawed and inaccurate conclusion, (2) block future U.N. actions premised on the falsehoods in the Report, (3) reaffirm the right of any sovereign nation to defend itself against terror targeting its civilians, and (4) continue to seek major reforms of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).</summary>
