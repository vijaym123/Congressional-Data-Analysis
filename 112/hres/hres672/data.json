Accepts responsibility to safeguard the welfare of the people of the United States and acknowledges that such welfare is best protected by policies that: (1) reduce energy consumption and increase energy efficiency; (2) shift power supply strategy from oil, coal, and natural gas to wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; (3) capture and store carbon by planting and greening of urban landscapes and improving land and forest management practice; and (4) help people prepare for and withstand the significant impacts of climate change. Pledges that the House of Representatives will promptly introduce and enact legislation to achieve such goals."
