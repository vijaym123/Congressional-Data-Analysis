Encourages the Philadelphia Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center to establish an advisory committee to consider whether the name of the hospital should be changed to recognize the efforts of an individual or group of veterans in the service of the United States. Supports the inclusion in the advisory committee of diverse stakeholders, including veteran service organizations, community organizations, patients served by the hospital, and other stakeholders. Believes the actions and commendations of specific individuals, including Corporal Michael Joseph Crescenz, should be appropriately considered by the advisory committee. Seeks any recommendations that the advisory committee may develop in order to inform congressional deliberations about changing the name of the Philadelphia Medical Center or otherwise recognizing the service of Philadelphia area veterans."
