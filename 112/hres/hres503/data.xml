  <summary>12/20/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) it supports the U.S. Soldier's Creed and the Warrior Ethos, which state that "I will never leave a fallen comrade"; (2) it believes it is unacceptable to abandon the search efforts for members of the Armed Forces who are missing or captured in the line of duty; and (3) the United States has a responsibility to continue fulfilling the promises made to members who are currently in a missing status as a result of service in Iraq and Afghanistan while the United States begins its strategic withdrawal.</summary>
