  <summary>3/10/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that, in order to meet our nation's growing long-term energy demands and maintain our economic viability in the world marketplace, any comprehensive and economically viable energy bill must address: (1) taking advantage of our abundant domestic coal supply; (2) using recent technological innovations to exploit our vast supply of natural gas; (3) increasing our domestic oil production and refining capacity; (4) expanding the use of renewable and alternative energy sources, with a focus on nuclear energy; (5) providing incentives for an increase in conservation and energy efficiency; (6) expanding research and development through new methods such as public-private partnerships; and (7) enhancing consumer awareness and education regarding methods to increase energy efficiency and available alternative fuel sources to reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil.</summary>
