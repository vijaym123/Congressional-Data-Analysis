  <summary>12/7/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the Secretary of Defense (DOD) should take immediate action to ensure that all classified information that pertains to any member of the Armed Forces who is missing and unaccounted for from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, or the Cold War be declassified and provided to the primary or designated next-of-kin, and made available to the National Archives and Records Administration; (2) sufficient funding and personnel should be approved for the POW/MIA accounting community for expanding such declassification and related efforts and activities; and (3) such funding should be sufficient to allow for the expansion of accounting efforts for all members missing and unaccounted for from all wars without degrading efforts related to the most recent wars and conflicts or reducing efforts to account for members in cases where acidic soil is destroying remains, development is encroaching, and eyewitnesses are dying.</summary>
