  <summary>5/3/2011--Introduced.
Supports the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside Israel. Encourages the inclusion of Prime Minister Fayyad in any interim and subsequent Palestinian governments. Maintains that a Palestinian government which includes Hamas must be prohibited from receiving U.S. aid until the government publicly commits to the Quartet principles. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that U.S. aid to the Palestinians is intended to: (1) prevent acts of terrorism against Israel, (2) create the stability and prosperity in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip that promotes peaceful coexistence with Israel, and (3) meet humanitarian needs in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</summary>
