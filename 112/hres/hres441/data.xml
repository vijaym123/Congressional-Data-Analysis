  <summary>10/14/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that further reductions to core national security funding, such as those triggered by the sequestration alternative of the Budget Control Act of 2011, may cause irreparable harm to U.S. interests and that decisions on U.S. national security policy and spending levels should be based on: (1) the National Security Strategy, a sequential determination of the threats to the United States, and an analysis of the capabilities needed to deter or defeat threats; and (2) the principles that a strong economy and a strong national security are inextricably linked and that national security is the most important obligation of the federal government and should take precedence over other priorities.</summary>
