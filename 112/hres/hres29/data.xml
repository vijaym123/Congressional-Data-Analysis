  <summary>1/7/2011--Introduced.
Supports the right of the citizens of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to access websites of their choosing and to have the freedom to share and publish information over the Internet. Calls on Vietnam to: (1) repeal Circular 07, Article 88, and similar statutes that restrict the Internet, so as to be in line with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Vietnam is a signatory; and (2) become a responsible member state of the international community by respecting individuals' freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of political association.</summary>
