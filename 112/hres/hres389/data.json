Reaffirms the importance of the full and equal participation of people of African descent around the world in all aspects of political, economic, social, and cultural life. Recognizes that as a result of their skin color and ancestry many Black Europeans have experienced injustices in the public and private sector. Urges: (1) European governments and members of civil society and the private sector, in consultation with Black European communities, to develop initiatives to combat racial discrimination and promote racial equality in Europe; and (2) the Secretary of State to provide support for such initiatives. Supports the adoption of a Joint Action Plan on Racial and Ethnic Equality and Inclusion between the European Union (EU) and United States and implementation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly 2011 Resolution on Strengthening Efforts to Combat Racism and Xenophobia and Foster Inclusion."
