Commends the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and the U.S. intelligence community for: (1) their tremendous commitment, perseverance, professionalism, and sacrifice in bringing Osama bin Laden to justice; and (2) committing themselves to defeating, disrupting, and dismantling al Qaeda. Commends the President for ordering the successful operations to locate and eliminate Osama bin Laden. Reaffirms the U.S. commitment to disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda and affiliated organizations around the world that threaten U.S. national security, eliminating a safe haven for terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and bringing terrorists to justice."
