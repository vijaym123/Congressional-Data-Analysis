      <text>POINT OF ORDER AGAINST CONSIDERATION - Ms. Moore stated that the provisions of H. Res. 656 violate section 426(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and made a point of order against consideration of the resolution. Subsequently, the Chair noted that the required threshold of identifying the specific language in question had been met, and the House proceeded with 20 minutes of debate on the question of consideration. At the conclusion of debate on the question of consideration, the Chair will put the question to wit: Will the House now consider the resolution?</text>
