  <summary>9/19/2012--Passed House amended.
Supports: (1) strengthened U.S. engagements with Georgia aimed at helping Georgia enhance its security and to restore its territorial integrity through exclusively peaceful means, (2) implementation of the United States-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, and (3) Georgia's North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership aspirations. Affirms that it is U.S. policy to support Georgia's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity and to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as regions of Georgia illegally occupied by the Russian Federation. Calls on: (1) the Russian Federation to end the occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and withdraw its troops from the internationally recognized border of Georgia; and (2) the Russian Federation, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Tuvalu, and Nauru to reverse their recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent. Urges Russia and the authorities in control in the regions to allow for the return of internally displaced persons and for international mission access to the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Encourages Georgia to: (1) continue strengthening its democracy; and (2) preserve cultural heritage, language, and ethnic identity aimed at reconciling divided communities of the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Affirms that a peaceful resolution to this conflict is a U.S. priority in the Caucasus region.</summary>
