  <summary>7/22/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) reducing the rate of personal debt is as vital to our economic health as addressing the federal debt and debt limit; and (2) Congress should cut our true debt burden by reducing home mortgage balances, forgiving student loans, and bringing down overall personal debt. Declares that helping U.S. citizens become free of debt to promote personal financial security and to strengthen the nation's economy should be a top priority of the United States.</summary>
