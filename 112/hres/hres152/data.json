Urges: (1) that ostomy products be recognized, categorized, covered, and adequately reimbursed by Medicare in a new payment category of \"prosthetic supplies\"; and (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure that HHS programs, policies, and payment practices facilitate innovation of and access to medical devices that restore or improve intestinal or urinary system function of individuals with an ostomy."
