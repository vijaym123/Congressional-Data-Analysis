  <summary>8/1/2012--Introduced.
Recognizes: (1) that prostate cancer has created a health crisis for African-American men; and (2) the importance of health coverage and access to care, as well as promoting informed decisionmaking between men and their doctors, taking into consideration the known risks and potential benefits of screening and treatment options for prostate cancer. Urges federal agencies to support: (1) research to address and attempt to end that crisis; (2) efforts relating to education, awareness, and early detection at the grassroots level; and (3) the Office of Minority Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in focusing on improving health and health care outcomes for African Americans at an elevated risk. Urges investment by federal agencies in research focusing on the improvement of early detection and treatment, such as the use of: (1) biomarkers to distinguish indolent forms of prostate cancer from lethal forms, and (2) advanced imaging tools.</summary>
