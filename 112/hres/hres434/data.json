Supports the designation of an International Freedom Corridor and the nomination of the Detroit River as an International World Heritage Site. Recognizes that a National Park Service (NPS) special resource study may establish national significance, suitability, and feasibility of a National Freedom Corridor. Acknowledges that the National Heritage Areas and Corridors are examples of recognitions that do not involve establishing a new unit of the National Park System, and for which the role of the NPS is primarily to assist state and local initiatives to preserve resources."
