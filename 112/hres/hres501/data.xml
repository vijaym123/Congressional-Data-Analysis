  <summary>12/19/2011--Passed House without amendment.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that any final measure to extend the payroll tax holiday, extend federally funded unemployment insurance benefits, or prevent decreases in reimbursement for physicians who provide care to Medicare beneficiaries: (1) extend the payroll tax holiday through December 31, 2012; (2) extend and reform federally funded unemployment insurance benefits; (3) eliminate for two years the cut in reimbursement for physicians who provide care to Medicare beneficiaries; (4) reduce spending from areas throughout the federal government, including a freeze on congressional salaries, in order to protect the Social Security Trust Fund, whose solvency would otherwise be diminished as a result of the payroll tax holiday; and (5) provide immediate job creation through final approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, expensing for capital assets placed in service in 2012, and drafting new regulations for boilers that are achievable and cost-effective.</summary>
