  <summary>3/29/2012--Introduced.
Mourns the death of Tibetans who have self-immolated and deplores the repressive policies targeting Tibetans. Calls on China to: (1) suspend implementation of religious control regulations and resume a dialogue with Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including the Dalai Lama or his representatives; and (2) release all persons who have been arbitrarily detained and allow access by journalists, foreign diplomats, and international organizations to Tibet. Commends the Dalai Lama for his decision to devolve his political power in favor of a democratic system. Congratulates Tibetans living in exile for holding, on March 20, 2011, a free election that met international electoral standards. Reaffirms the friendship between the United States and Tibet. Calls on the Department of State to: (1) fully implement the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, and (2) seek from China a full accounting of the forcible removal of monks from Kirti Monastery.</summary>
