  <summary>3/30/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the regime of Mu'ammar al-Qadhaffi is no longer the legitimate government of Libya; (2) the Transitional National Council, based at Benghazi and headed by Mustafa Abdul Jalil, should be considered the legitimate representatives of the Libyan people and nation; (3) the United States should encourage the post-Qadhaffi government to repay the expenses incurred by the U.S. Armed Forces during military operations undertaken to protect the Libyan people; and (4) as Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner wrote in his letter to President Obama on March 23, 2011, "a U.N. Security Council resolution does not substitute for a U.S. political and military strategy," the U.S. course in Libya must be determined in accord with U.S. interests and values and in consultation with allies. States that the House of Representatives: (1) supports President Obama's strategy of protecting the Libyan people from the Qadhaffi tyranny without risking the direct intervention of U.S. ground forces in the Libyan civil war; (2) supports freezing Qadhaffi's assets with the understanding that such assets will be made available to the legitimate representatives of the Libyan people once they have been recognized by the United States; and (3) calls for the United States in cooperation with its allies to provide the Libyan freedom fighters with the arms, supplies, and other materials needed to liberate the entire country.</summary>
