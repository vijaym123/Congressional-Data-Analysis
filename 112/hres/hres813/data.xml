  <summary>11/16/2012--Passed House without amendment.
Expresses unwavering commitment to the security of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders and supports its inherent right to act in self-defense to protect its citizens against acts of terrorism. Reiterates that Hamas must end Gaza-linked terrorist rocket and missile attacks against Israel, recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce violence, and agree to accept previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. Urges the U.N. Security Council to condemn the recent spike in Gaza-linked terrorist missile attacks against Israel. Encourages the President to continue to work diplomatically with the international community to prevent Hamas and other Gaza-based terrorist organizations from retaining or rebuilding the capability to launch rockets and missiles against Israel.</summary>
