    "text": "Condemns in the strongest possible terms the horrific attack that occurred at the \"Congress on your Corner\" event hosted by Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011. Offers heartfelt condolences to the families, friends, and loved ones of those killed in that attack. Expresses hope for the rapid and complete recovery of those wounded in the shooting. Honors the memory of Christina Taylor Green, Dorothy Morris, John Roll, Phyllis Schneck, Dorwan Stoddard, and Gabriel Zimmerman. Applauds the bravery and quick thinking exhibited by those who prevented the gunman from taking more lives and helped to save those who had been wounded. Recognizes the service of the first responders who raced to the scene and the health care professionals who tended to the victims once they reached the hospital and whose service and skill saved lives. Reaffirms the bedrock principle of American democracy and representative government, memorialized in the First Amendment and which Representative Giffords herself read in the Hall of the House of Representatives on January 6, 2011, of \"the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" Stands firm in the belief in a democracy in which all can participate and in which intimidation and threats of violence cannot silence the voices of any American. Honors the service and leadership of Representative Giffords, a distinguished Member of the House of Representatives, as she courageously fights to recover. States that when the House adjourns on January 12, 2011, it does so out of respect to the victims of this attack."
