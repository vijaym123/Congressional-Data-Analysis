  <summary>2/15/2011--Introduced.
Calls for an end to the violence, arrests, torture, and ill treatment perpetrated against Iranian citizens as well as the unconditional release of all political prisoners in Iran. Calls upon the U.S. government, the President, and the Secretary of State to condemn human rights violations in Iran and support the Iranian people's endeavors towards democracy. Calls for an end to a selective approach to Iranian opponents who struggle for democracy and human rights and invites the Secretary, in coalition with British and European allies, to remove the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran from the State Department's list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. Calls for the adoption of measures by the President to impose sanctions while welcoming the U.S. government's efforts to create an international consensus to deal with Iran's nuclear program. Calls on the President to persuade U.S. allies and other countries to enact appropriate measures aimed at depriving Iranian banks and financial institutions involved in nuclear activities and backing of terrorist groups from access to the international monetary system.</summary>
