Urges state authorities having jurisdiction over building and housing construction and inspections to include requirements within their rules, regulations, and codes for proper bonding of yellow CSST gas piping in accordance with specified national fuel gas and electric and local codes. Encourages further education efforts of the public, relevant building and housing officials, homeowners, and construction professionals on the need to properly bond yellow CSST retroactively in structures already containing CSST."
