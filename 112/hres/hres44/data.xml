  <summary>1/19/2011--Introduced.
Declares the sense of the House of Representatives that it should be U.S. policy to allow for the development of offshore oil and gas-rich areas in an environmentally responsible manner. Declares that the Department of the Interior should: (1) complete promptly environmental analysis related to offshore leasing activities, including specified programs; (2) rescind promptly its announcement that the government will not propose any new oil drilling in waters off the East Coast, West Coast, or Eastern Gulf of Mexico for at least the next seven years; (3) expedite the processing and approval of both deepwater and shallow water drilling permits, exploration plans, development operations coordination documents, and development and production plans; and (4) allow new lease sales in all permissible areas of the Outer Continental Shelf, including the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and Atlantic areas.</summary>
