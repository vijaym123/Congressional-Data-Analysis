  <summary>6/16/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that it is U.S. policy to support its ally Israel in seeking peace with its neighbors, particularly toward a two-state solution that results in a free, nonmilitarized Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel. Commends the Prime Minister of Israel for his efforts to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Calls on the Palestinian leadership to return to the negotiating table with Israel. Urges the Administration to mount a global effort to convince the Palestinians and U.S. allies that Palestinian statehood will not be achieved outside of negotiations at the United Nations (U.N.), and to use the U.S. veto if the issue comes before the U.N. Security Council in September.</summary>
