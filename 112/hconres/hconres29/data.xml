  <summary>3/9/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) state and local governments should be supported for taking actions to discourage illegal immigration, (2) current immigration laws should be enforced to the highest extent of the law, (3) the Department of Justice (DOJ) should not use taxpayer funds to sue states or local jurisdictions that are forced to pass their own immigration legislation due to the federal government's failure to act on the issue, and (4) federal legislation to enhance border security and immigration law enforcement should be passed quickly in order to ease the burden on state and local governments.</summary>
