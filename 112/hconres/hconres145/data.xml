  <summary>1/1/2013--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the North Korean missile launch of December 12, 2012, represents a flagrant violation of specified U.N. Security Council resolutions; (2) North Korea continues to defy the U.N., its Six-Party partners, and the international community; (3) the member nations should immediately impose sanctions covered by such resolutions and censure North Korea; (4) all current restrictions against North Korea, including sanctions that ban the importation into the United States of North Korean goods, should remain in effect until North Korea no longer engages in activities that threaten U.S. interests and global peace; (5) China should cooperate with the United States in a new round of Security Council sanctions, pressure its North Korean partner, redouble its efforts to prevent Chinese companies from transferring military and dual-use technologies to North Korea, and crack down on transshipments through China that relate to North Korean military, missile, and nuclear programs and proliferation activities; and (6) North Korea should dismantle its missile and nuclear weapons programs, cease its proliferation activities, and comply with all relevant international agreements and Security Council resolutions.</summary>
