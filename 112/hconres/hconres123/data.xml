  <summary>5/10/2012--Introduced.
Recognizes that: (1) the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is critical to stopping the spread of HIV worldwide, and (2) U.S. leadership in the fight to eliminate pediatric HIV should continue. Expresses support for: (1) providing women with HIV counseling and testing services and scaling up access to services that prevent mother-to-child transmission; and (2) U.S. and international efforts to create a generation free of HIV, to eliminate new pediatric HIV infections worldwide, and to keep the mothers of that generation alive. Calls for greater access to more efficacious antiretroviral drug regimens for the health of women and children living with HIV and as a prophylaxis to stop mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, delivery, and breast feeding.</summary>
