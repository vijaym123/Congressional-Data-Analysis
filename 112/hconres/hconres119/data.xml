  <summary>4/24/2012--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) involuntary homelessness should be eliminated; (2) the federal government should provide adequate funding for the rental housing voucher program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, the Community Development Block Grant program, and the HOME Investment Partnerships program; (3) legislation should be enacted that provides the National Housing Trust Fund with the $1 billion requested in the President's FY2013 Budget Request; and (4) the federal government should move away from a "shelter first" housing policy and instead promote a "housing first" policy that provides employment and training opportunities, transportation, and other self-sufficiency services to help the involuntarily homeless.</summary>
