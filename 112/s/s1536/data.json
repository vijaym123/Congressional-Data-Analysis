Exempts any communication: (1) initiated by a consumer if the consumer knows or reasonably should know that the employee or agent is located outside the United States; or (2) related to the provision of emergency services. Authorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to exclude certain classes or types of business entities or customer services communications from the requirements of this Act for exceptionally compelling circumstances that justify such exclusions. Sets forth enforcement provisions."
