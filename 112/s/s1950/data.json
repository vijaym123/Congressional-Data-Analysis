    "text": "Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Enhancement Act of 2011 - Title I: Commercial Motor Vehicle Registration - (Sec. 101) Revises commercial motor vehicle registration requirements to prohibit the Secretary from registering a person to provide motorcoach services until that person has: (1) submitted a comprehensive management plan that is in place to ensure compliance with DOT motor carrier safety regulations; (2) disclosed any common ownership, common management, common control, or common familial relationships between the carrier and any other motor carrier, freight forwarder, or broker that have occurred in the five-years preceding the filing of an application for registration; and (3) passed the DOT written proficiency examination the Secretary is hereby directed to establish to test a motor carrier's knowledge of federal and state motor carrier safety regulations, standards, and orders. (Sec. 102) Reduces from 18 months to 12 months after motorcoach operations begin the deadline for mandatory safety reviews of newly registered motorcoach owners or operators. Authorizes the Secretary to register a person to provide motorcoach services after that person undergoes a pre-authorization safety audit. (Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretary to withhold, suspend, amend, or revoke the registration of a motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder: (1) for failure to obey a subpoena issued by the Secretary; (2) for failure to disclose in its application a material fact relevant to its willingness and ability to comply with federal law, regulations, or a registration condition; or (3) that is or was related through common ownership, common management, common control, or common familial relationship to any other motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder. Requires the Secretary to develop data analysis capacity and programs for the means to determine such a relationship. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to: (1) issue a report on the appropriateness of current minimum financial requirements and bond and insurance requirements for motor carriers, brokers, and and freight forwarders; and (2) not later than six months after publication of the report, initiate a rulemaking, if necessary, to revise such requirements. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to register an employer or person subject to safety jurisdiction and regulation. Authorizes an employer or person to operate a commercial motor vehicle only if that employer or person is registered by the Secretary and receives a DOT number. Sets forth conditions for withholding, revoking, or suspending such registration.

(Sec. 108) Increases civil penalties against motor carriers or foreign motor carriers of passengers or motor carriers of hazardous waste for: (1) failing to comply with certain reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and (2) operating without being registered. (Sec. 109) Revises the requirement that the Secretary revoke the registration of a motor carrier that has been conducting unsafe operations which are an imminent hazard to public health or property. Makes revocation mandatory regardless of whether the unsafe operations are in the present or were in the past. (Sec. 110) Increases from a range of $100-$5,000 to a range of $1,000-$10,000 the civil penalties against a motor carrier, motor carrier of migrant workers, or motor private carrier for failing to respond to a subpoena or requirement of the Secretary to appear and testify or produce records. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold, suspend, amend, or revoke the registration of a motorcoach carrier for failure to obey such subpoena or requirement. (Sec. 111) Revises conditions for fleetwide out-of-service orders as penalties for operating without required registration. Changes the primary reference from motor vehicles to motor carriers. (Thus authorizes the Secretary to order motor carrier operations out-of-service for a motor carrier operating without a required registration.) (Sec. 112) Revises requirements related to the duty of employers and employees to comply with commercial motor vehicle safety regulations. Prohibits two or more motor carriers, employers, or persons from using common ownership, common management, common control, or common familial relationship to avoid compliance, or conceal noncompliance or a history of noncompliance with commercial motor vehicle safety regulations or an order of the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to impose appropriate sanctions for violation of this prohibition. Applies such sanctions to conduct that is intentional or knowing and to repeated instances of negligent conduct. (Sec. 113) Authorizes the Secretary to take an action pursuant to federal commercial motor vehicle safety requirements against any successor of a motor carrier, employer, or owner or operator to the same extent as the Secretary may take action against the motor carrier, employer, or owner or operator.
