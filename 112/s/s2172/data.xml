  <summary>3/7/2012--Introduced.
Fairness in Women-Owned Small Business Contracting Act of 2012 - Amends the Small Business Act with respect to the procurement program for women-owned small businesses (providing a federal procurement contracting preference to such businesses) to: (1) remove the requirement that the woman or women owning such business be economically disadvantaged, (2) remove contract award price limits, and (3) allow a contracting officer to award a sole source contract to such a business under the same conditions as such a contract may be awarded to a qualified HUBZone (historically underutilized business zone) small business. Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to: (1) periodically conduct a study to identify any U.S. industry in which women are underrepresented; and (2) every five years, report study results to the congressional small business committees.</summary>
