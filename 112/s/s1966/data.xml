  <summary>12/8/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that it is urgent that the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) application process be reformed by the end of 2012, when many of the more than 1 million current TWIC holders will be required to renew their TWICs. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to reform the process for the enrollment, activation, issuance, and renewal of TWICs to require not more than one in-person visit to a designated enrollment center.</summary>
