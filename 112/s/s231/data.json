Prohibits any action taken by the Administrator before the end of such period (including any action before enactment of this Act) from being considered to make carbon dioxide or methane a pollutant subject to regulation under the CAA for any source other than a new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine. Exempts from such prohibitions: (1) any action under the CAA's emission standards for motor vehicles, (2) any action relating to the preparation of a report or the enforcement of a reporting requirement, or (3) any action relating to the provision of technical support at a state's request."
