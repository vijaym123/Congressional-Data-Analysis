Authorizes PRC to establish new classes of mail at the request of USPS. Directs the Postmaster General to: (1)\u00a0designate a senior officer in USPS who has a wide range of knowledge of USPS, its customers, marketing, and product innovation\u00a0to serve as Chief Product Innovation Officer; and (2) develop a program to educate postal employees and retirees on how Medicare benefits can interact with or supplement benefits under the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHB). Requires USPS to develop a program to increase compliance with postage requirements, including compliance with fraud investigations. Requires surplus contributions to the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) to be used by USPS to fund separation payments to USPS employees who voluntarily separate from service before October 1, 2014. Grants postmasters and supervisors the right to consult with USPS on any changes to or reductions of compensation and benefits.\u00a0 Extends\u00a0protections afforded to federal employees in any reduction in force to USPS employees.\u00a0\u00a0 Authorizes the USPS Board of Governors to allow not more than 12 USPS officers or employees in critical senior executive or equivalent positions to receive total annual compensation in an amount not to exceed 135% of: (1) level I of the Executive Schedule for the Postmaster General, (2) level II of the Executive Schedule for the Deputy Postmaster General, and (3) level III of the Executive Schedule for any other officer or employee."
