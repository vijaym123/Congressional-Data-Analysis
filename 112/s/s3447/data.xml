  <summary>7/26/2012--Introduced.
Disability Pension Fairness Act - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Act of 1974 (ERISA), with respect to single-employer plan guaranteed benefits, to revise the prohibition against reduction of the maximum monthly disability benefit payable to a plan participant solely on account of his or her age in the case of a benefit payable by reason of a disability that occurs on or before termination of the plan. Extends this prohibition with respect to a disability occuring after plan termination as well, without regard to whether the disability was or would have been covered under the terms of the plan.</summary>
