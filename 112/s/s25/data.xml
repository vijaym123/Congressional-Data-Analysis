  <summary>1/25/2011--Introduced.
Stop Unfair Giveaways and Restrictions Act of 2011 or SUGAR Act of 2011 - Eliminates nonrecourse support loans for sugar producers. Lowers sugarcane and sugar beet loans rates each year from 2012-2014 until they are $0 for the 2015 crop. Eliminates: (1) sugar price supports and sugar processor loans as of 2015, and (2) sugar marketing quotas and allotments. Eliminates: (1) Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) forfeited sugar storage payments, (2) sugar processor storage facility loans, and (3) the feedstock flexibility program for bioenergy producers as of the 2013 sugar beet crop year. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to implement a program to increase the tariff-rate quotas for raw cane sugar and refined sugars that ensures a competitive U.S. sugar processing industry and an adequate supply of reasonably priced sugar in the United States.</summary>
