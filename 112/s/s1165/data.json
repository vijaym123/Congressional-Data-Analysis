    "text": "Button Cell Battery Safety Act of 2011 - Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to promulgate: (1) a standard requiring button cell battery compartments of battery-operated or assisted consumer products to be secured in a manner that reduces access to such batteries by children that are three years of age or younger; and (2) standards requiring warning labels to be included in any literature that accompanies such a product, on packaging for such batteries sold to consumers, and directly on such a product in a manner that is visible to the consumer upon installation or replacement of the battery. Requires such labels to clearly identify the hazard of ingestion and to instruct consumers to keep new and used batteries out of the reach of children and to seek immediate medical attention if a battery is ingested. Exempts such regulations from procedures for consumer product safety rules. Makes such regulations effective one year after the standard is promulgated."
