Public Agency Accountability for Sexual Harassment Act - Prohibits sexual harassment (as defined under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) by any individual who is an agent of an organization or government&#160;and who administers a program or activity from&#160;which an annual&#160;benefit of more than $5,000 is derived.&#160; Requires such organization or government&#160;to terminate its relationship with an agent who engages in sexual harassment and to disclose the terms of any settlement resulting from an act of sexual harassment by an agent.&#160; Sets forth enforcement provisions and fines for violations of this Act. Declares that&#160;states shall not be&#160;immune under the&#160;Eleventh Amendment&#160;from suit in federal court for a violation of this Act and that states waive sovereign immunity by receiving federal assistance.</summary>
