    "text": "Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to revise the requirement that the concurrent resolution on the budget be adopted before consideration of budget-related legislation. Replaces the current requirement with one that makes it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any legislation after April 15 (whether or not budget-related) unless the concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year has been adopted for the budget year. Allows waiver or suspension of this requirement for an emergency by a vote of three-fifths of the Members."
