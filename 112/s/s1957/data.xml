Requires agency heads to publish on agency websites the information required by this Act, the latest performance reviews of each agency program, improper payment rates,&#160;the total amount of unspent and unobligated program funds held by the agency and grant recipients, and recommendations for consolidating duplicative programs, eliminating waste and inefficiency, and terminating lower priority, outdated, and unnecessary programs and initiatives.
