Includes within such definition forest products that meet biobased content requirements, notwithstanding market maturity. Defines \"forest product\" as a product made from materials derived from the practice of forestry or the management of growing timber, and includes: (1) pulp, paper, paperboard, pellets, and wood products; and (2) any recycled products derived from forest materials."
