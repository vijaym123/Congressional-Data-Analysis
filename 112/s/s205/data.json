Requires that the state of Alaska receive 37.5% of: (1) any bonus bid paid for leasing rights for any area in the Alaska Adjacent Zone; and (2) specified post-leasing revenues including lease rental payments and lease royalty payments, as well as royalty proceeds from a sale of royalties taken in kind. Sets forth an allocation scheme under which the Secretary of the Interior is directed to pay: (1) 20% of any allocable state share directly to coastal political subdivisions, (2) 33% of any allocable state share to certain Regional Corporations, and (3) 7% of any allocable state share directly to Indian tribes. Instructs the Secretary to distribute 6.25% of certain federal royalty revenues into: (1) a specified land and water conservation fund to provide financial assistance to states, and (2) direct federal deficit reduction."
