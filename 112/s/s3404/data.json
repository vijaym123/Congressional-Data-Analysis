    "text": "Department of Energy Reorganization Act of 2012 - Establishes within the Department of Energy (DOE) an Office of Federal Energy Production, headed by a Director appointed by the Secretary of Energy. Transfers to such Director the current functions of the Directors of: (1) the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, (2) the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, and (3) the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior with respect to oil and gas development and renewable energy production. Establishes within DOE the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, to whose Director are transferred the functions and regulatory authority of the Director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement of the Department of the Interior. Terminates the latter Bureau upon completion of all transfers. Establishes within DOE the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, to whose Director are transferred the functions of the Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management of the Department of the Interior. Terminates the latter Bureau upon completion of all transfers. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, with respect to the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas leasing program, to require the Secretary to certify that the oil and gas leasing program prepared will best meet national energy needs for the five-year period following its approval or reapproval. Directs the Secretary to amend the program to include additional lease sales in additional areas if it is determined that the United States will require more than one million barrels of oil per day for the next fiscal year from foreign sources other than Canada and Mexico. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to authorize appropriations to the Secretary to implement oil shale and gilsonite leases and permits. Exempts DOE from the jurisdiction of the Equal Access to Justice Act."
