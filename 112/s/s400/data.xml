  <summary>2/17/2011--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Power Act to deny any rate or charge for the transmission of electric energy contained in any filing made or proceeding initiated after June 17, 2010, from being considered just and reasonable unless it is based upon an allocation of costs for new transmission facilities that is reasonably proportionate to measurable economic or reliability benefits projected, as determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to accrue to the persons that pay such rates or charges.</summary>
