Defines a \"military humanitarian operation\" as a military operation involving the deployment of members or weapons systems of the Armed Forces where hostile activities are reasonably anticipated and with the aim of preventing or responding to a humanitarian catastrophe, including its regional consequences, or addressing a threat posed to international peace and security. Provides for the consideration of a joint resolution of approval of such use."
