  <summary>5/12/2011--Introduced.
Job Protection Act - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to provide that an employer's expression or written dissemination of views, argument, or opinion regarding the costs associated with collective bargaining, work stoppages, or strikes shall not constitute antiunion animus or unlawful motive (an unfair labor practice), if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit. Denies the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), unless an employer has been adjudicated finally to have unlawfully undertaken certain actions, any power to: (1) order the employer to relocate, shut down, or transfer any existing or planned facility or work or employment opportunity; (2) prevent the employer from making such relocations, transfers, or expansions to new or existing facilities in the future; or (3) prevent the employer from closing or not developing a facility, or from eliminating an employment opportunity. Declares that, unless an employer has been so adjudicated, nothing under the Act shall: (1) prevent the employer from choosing where to locate, develop, or expand its business or facilities; (2) require the employer to move, transfer, or relocate any facility, production line, or employment opportunity, or require the employer to cease or refrain from doing so; or (3) prevent the employer from closing a facility or eliminating any employment opportunity.</summary>
