Prescribes procedures allocation of indeterminate loss claims and their payment. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish an arbitration panel for appeals regarding loss allocation for resolving indeterminate claims.

Amends the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 to: (1) increase the maximum civil money penalty against regulated lenders for failure to require flood insurance, (2) modify requirements for the escrow of flood insurance payments, and (3) require policyholder notification by a regulated lending institution that insurance coverage may cease upon policyholder's final mortgage payment.Requires the Administrator of FEMA to continue to work with the insurance industry, state insurance regulators, and other interested parties to implement certain minimum training and education standards for all insurance agents who sell flood insurance policies.</summary>
