Defines \"aviation security preclearance agreement\" to mean an agreement that delineates and implements security standards and protocols comparable to those of the United States and therefore sufficiently effective to enable passengers to deplane into sterile areas of U.S. airports. Directs the Assistant Secretary to report annually to Congress on the re-screening of baggage."
