    "text": "Combating Military Counterfeits Act of 2011 - Amends the federal criminal code to impose criminal penalties on persons who traffic in counterfeit goods or services if: (1) the offense involved a military good or service that malfunctioned, failed, or was compromised and could reasonably be foreseen to cause serious bodily injury or death, disclosure of classified information, impairment of combat operations, or other significant harm to a member of the Armed Forces or to national security; and (2) the person had knowledge that the good or service is falsely identified as meeting military standards or is intended for use in a military or national security application. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to: (1) review and amend federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements to reflect the intent of Congress to increase penalties for defendants that sell infringing products to, or for the use by or for, the Armed Forces or a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency or for use in critical infrastructure or in national security applications; and (2) consider an appropriate offense level enhancement and minimum offense level for offenses that involve a product that is used to maintain or operate critical infrastructure or that is used by or for an entity of the federal government or a state or local government in furtherance of the administration of justice, national defense, or national security. Requires the Commission, in accordance with emergency authority under the Sentencing Act of 1987, to promulgate such guidelines and policy statements no later than 180 days after this Act's enactment and amend such guidelines to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law."
