    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "2011-10-11", 
    "text": "Veterans Programs Improvement Act of 2011 - Title I: Health Care Matters - (Sec. 101) Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to waive the imposition or collection of copayments for telehealth and telemedicine visits of veterans. (Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary to carry out a program of teleconsultation for the provision of remote mental health and traumatic brain injury (TBI) assessments in facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that are not otherwise able to provide such assessments without contracting with third party providers or reimbursing providers through a fee basis system. Requires the Secretary to: (1) offer medical residents training opportunities in telemedicine; and (2) modify the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system to include teleconsultation, teleretinal imaging, telemedicine, and telehealth coordination services. Defines \"teleconsultation,\" \"telehealth,\" \"telemedicine,\" and \"teleretinal imaging.\" (Sec. 103) Treats Vet Centers as VA facilities for purposes of authorized payments or allowances for beneficiary travel to or from a VA facility in connection with medical care. Requires a report from the Secretary to Congress on the feasibility and advisability of paying the actual expenses of travel or allowances for such travel. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 104) Requires the Secretary to admit into any VA building or property service animals accompanying individuals with disabilities. (Sec. 105) Includes within a program of individualized rehabilitation and reintegration plans for veterans with TBI: (1) the goal of maximizing the individual's independence, and (2) improving such veterans' behavioral functioning. Requires the inclusion of rehabilitative services in: (1) a VA comprehensive program of long-term care for veterans with TBI, and (2) cooperative agreements for the use of non-VA facilities for veterans' rehabilitation from TBI. (Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary to establish and operate centers of excellence for rural health research, education, and clinical activities, including: (1) research on furnishing health services in rural areas, (2) development of specific models to be used in furnishing health services to veterans in such areas, (3) education and training for VA health care professionals, and (4) development and implementation of clinical activities and systems.

(Sec. 109) Directs the Secretary to enter into a contract or agreement with each state home to pay for nursing home care provided to certain veterans with service-connected disabilities. Requires such payment to be based on a methodology, developed by the Secretary in consultation with the home, to adequately reimburse the home for the care provided under such contract or agreement. (Current law requires payment at the lesser of the prevailing rate in the geographic area for non-VA nursing homes or the daily cost of care, both of which are determined by the Secretary.) Makes this section effective for care provided on or after January 1, 2012. (Sec. 110) Authorizes the Secretary to disclose information about a veteran or his or her dependent to a state controlled substance monitoring program to the extent necessary to prevent misuse and diversion of prescription medicines. (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and implement a plan to ensure the recovery and collection of third-party insurer amounts for deposit into the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Care Collections Fund, and (2) monitor such recovery and collection. Title II: Homeless Veterans Matters - (Sec. 201) Allows grants made by the Secretary for homeless veterans' comprehensive services programs (outreach, rehabilitation, vocational counseling, and transitional housing assistance) to be used for the construction of new facilities. Prohibits the Secretary from denying applications for such grants solely on the basis that the grant entity proposes to use funding from other private or public sources, as long as such entity demonstrates that a private nonprofit organization will provide project oversight and site control. Requires the Secretary to: (1) study matters relating to the method used to make per diem payments to grant recipients, (2) develop more effective and efficient procedures for fiscal control and fund accounting by grant recipients, and (3) develop a more efficient and effective method for adequately reimbursing grant recipients for services furnished to homeless veterans. Requires a report to Congress on such study and methods. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 202) Revises eligibility: (1) under the grant program for entities serving homeless veterans with special needs, and (2) for treatment and rehabilitation of homeless veterans who are not seriously mentally ill. (Sec. 204) Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress a comprehensive plan to end homelessness among veterans.

(Sec. 209) Authorizes the Secretary to consider entering into agreements with state or local government agencies, tribal organizations, and nonprofit organizations to collaborate in the provision of case management services under the VA supported housing program to ensure that homeless veterans facing the most significant difficulties in obtaining suitable housing receive the assistance they require. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to collaborating entities. Provides funding. Requires the Secretary to report annually to Congress on such collaborative services. Title III: Housing Matters - Andrew Connolly Veterans' Housing Act - (Sec. 302) Amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to extend from 9 to 12 months after a servicemember's period of military service both the stay of proceedings to enforce an obligation on real or personal property owned by the servicemember prior to such military service, as well as the protection against sale, foreclosure, or seizure of such property. Requires a report from the Comptroller General to Congress on such protections provided during the five-year period ending on the date of enactment of this Act. (Sec. 303) Considers a veteran who is unable to occupy a home because of active-duty status to have satisfied the occupancy requirement relating to housing financed through the VA if the veteran's dependent child is occupying or will occupy the home and the veteran's attorney or a legal guardian of the dependent child makes the VA-required occupancy certification. (Sec. 304) Waives the veterans' housing loan fee for veterans eligible to receive veterans' disability compensation as the result of a pre-discharge review of existing medical evidence. (Under current law, such fee is waived only for veterans rated eligible to receive compensation as the result of a pre-discharge VA examination and subsequent disability rating.) (Sec. 305) Increases the authorized amount of VA assistance for permanent and total service-disabled veterans who are temporarily residing in housing owned by a family member from: (1) $14,000 to $28,000, in the case of the acquisition of housing with special features; and (2) $2,000 to $5,000, in the case of adaptations to a current residence. Directs the Secretary to adjust such amounts annually based on the residential home cost-of-construction index. Extends such authority through 2021. (Sec. 306) Expands eligibility for VA specially adapted housing assistance to include veterans with visual acuity of 20/200 (under current law, 5/200) or less.

Title IV: Compensation and Pension Matters - (Sec. 401) Increases to $31,305 the combined annual rate of pension for two married veterans meeting specified disability and service or age and service requirements when both such veterans need regular aid and attendance. (Sec. 402) Authorizes the Secretary to provide an effective date of an award of disability compensation, in the case of a veteran who submits a fully-developed claim, of up to one year before the date of receipt of such claim. Makes such date effective with respect to claims filed after FY2012. (Sec. 403) Entitles a surviving spouse to a benefit for the month of a veteran's death if, at the time of the veteran's death: (1) the veteran was receiving veterans' disability compensation or veteran's pension, or (2) the veteran was not receiving such compensation or pension but had a claim pending for the month of the veteran's death for which benefits would have been payable had the veteran not died. Requires that, if a claim for entitlement to such benefits is pending at the time of a veteran's death and the pending claim was subsequently granted, any additional amount of benefits for the month of death would be paid as accrued VA benefits. (Sec. 404) Requires initial review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals of a substantive appeal containing new evidence, unless the claimant requests initial review by the agency of original jurisdiction. Title V: Memorial, Burial, and Cemetery Matters - (Sec. 501) Amends the federal criminal code concerning the prohibition on disruptions of funerals of members or former members of the Armed Forces to increase the period covered under such prohibition from one to two hours before and after a military funeral. Includes within such unlawful conduct any disturbance or disruption occurring within 500 feet of the boundary of a funeral location, or on or near the boundary of the residence of a surviving member of a deceased's immediate family. Provides civil remedies, including actual and statutory damages. Makes identical changes under federal veterans' provisions concerning the prohibition on certain demonstrations and disruptions at national cemeteries, including Arlington National Cemetery (Arlington).

(Sec. 604) Authorizes appropriations for FY2012 for the projects and leases authorized under this title. Provides funding limitations. (Sec. 605) Prohibits the Secretary from using bid savings on a VA project to expand the purpose of a project except pursuant to a law enacted after the date on which the Secretary submits to the veterans and appropriations committees notification of: (1) the project that is the source of the bid savings, (2) the project for which the expansion is to be used, (3) a description of the expansion purpose, and (4) the amounts which the Secretary intends to obligate for the expansion.

Requires any such grant to be available to acquire a suitable housing unit with special fixtures or moveable facilities made necessary by the veteran's disability, along with the land for such housing. Permits the Secretary to: (1) extend up to an additional two months the subsistence allowances of veterans displaced by such disasters while satisfactorily following a program of employment services prescribed in a vocational rehabilitation program for certain veterans with service-connected disabilities; (2) waive the annual limitation on the number of veterans eligible to participate in programs of independent living services and assistance when a veteran has been displaced as the result of a disaster; (3) in determining whether certain real estate housing loans are secured by a first lien, disregard or allow for subordination to a superior lien created by a duly recorded covenant running with the realty in favor of a public entity that has provided or will provide assistance in response to a major disaster as determined by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; and (4) provide or assist in providing a second automobile or other specified conveyance to eligible disabled veterans and members of the Armed Forces if an automobile or other conveyance previously purchased with assistance was destroyed by such a disaster through no fault of the individual and without compensation by a property insurer.
