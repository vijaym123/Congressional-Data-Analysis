Imposes enhanced criminal penalties for violations (not to exceed 10 years for a first offense or 20 years for a subsequent offense, involving the same controlled substance and schedule). Exempts any controlled substance that has been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the drug approval process or that has been altered at the direction of a medical practitioner for a legitimate medical purpose.Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to review its guidelines and policy statements to reflect the enhanced penalties provided by this Act."
