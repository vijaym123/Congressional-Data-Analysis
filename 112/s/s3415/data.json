Requires the publicly available records to be updated annually to include payments made during the previous year. Requires such records, including a payment breakdowns showing the specific amount of the damages, interest, and attorneys' fees, to be maintained on a publicly accessible Internet website. Prohibits records from being made available under this Act if: (1) the payment was not the result of any executive branch, federal agency, or instrumentality statutory or regulatory approval or permit related case, court order, consent decree, or settlement; or (2) the disclosure of the information is otherwise prohibited by law or court order, or is not in the best interest of national security."
