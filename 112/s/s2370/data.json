(Sec. 4) Modifies restrictions on employment by a trustee of professional persons to declare a person is not disqualified for such employment by a small business debtor solely because the person holds a claim of less than $5,000 that arose before commencement of the case in bankruptcy. (Sec. 5) Modifies requirements for debtor conversion from chapter 11 to chapter 7 (Liquidation), or for dismissal in chapter 11, for cause to include within the scope of \"cause\" the failure of a small business debtor to designate itself as a small business debtor. (Sec. 6) Instructs the Comptroller General to report to Congress detailing: (1) the number and percentage of all cases filed under chapter 11 in which the debtor is a small business debtor, and (2) recommendations for improving the confirmation rate for small business debtors."
