  <summary>1/25/2011--Introduced.
Affordable Footwear Act of 2011 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the reduction or elimination of duties on certain imported footwear would provide significant benefits to U.S. consumers, particularly lower-income families. Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to provide for the duty-free treatment of certain footwear (including children's shoes) made of rubber or plastics that are imported into the United States. Deems the outer sole of shoes made of rubber or plastics to which textile materials are attached or incorporated to be made only of rubber or plastics. Amends the Caribbean Basic Economic Recovery Act to provide footwear imported directly from Haiti into the United States with the same preferential treatment that is provided to certain imported footwear under the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement.</summary>
