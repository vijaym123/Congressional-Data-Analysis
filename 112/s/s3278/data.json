Defines a \"qualified project\" as: (1) the construction, modernization, renovation, or repair of qualified housing for such eligible individuals; (2) the payment of interest on bonds or other financing instruments (except refinancing instruments) issued for such activities; or (3) the repayment of a loan used for such construction and so forth, or to purchase or lease real property for qualified housing purposes. Defines a \"qualified community\" as any open country, or any place, town, village, or city that is not part of or associated with an urban area and that has a population between 2,500 to 10,000, and is not accessible by a motor vehicle. Authorizes the State Director of Rural Development for a state to evaluate for the Secretary any application for a qualified project in the state. Requires the Secretary to take the evaluation into consideration in determining whether to provide such assistance. Requires the Secretary to give priority to: (1) a state education agency (SEA) or local educational agency (LEA), (2) a state or local housing authority, (3) an Indian tribe or tribal organization, (4) a tribally designated housing entity, (5) a local government, or (6) a consortium of any such entities."
