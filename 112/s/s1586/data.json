    "text": "Clean Energy Technology Manufacturing and Export Assistance Act of 2011 - Requires the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Clean Energy Technology Manufacturing and Export Assistance Program, to be carried out by the Under Secretary for International Trade, to: (1) promote policies to reduce production costs and encourage innovation, investment, and productivity among businesses in the United States that produce or export clean energy technologies or related services; (2) implement a national strategy with respect to the exportation of such technologies and related services; and (3) ensure that such businesses, including suppliers of parts for the production of such technologies and engineering and design firms, have the information and assistance necessary to be competitive and to create and maintain clean energy technology jobs. Defines \"clean energy technology\" to means a technology related to the production, use, transmission, storage, control, or conservation of energy that is designed to: (1) reduce the need for additional energy supplies by using existing energy supplies with greater efficiency or by transmitting, distributing, or transporting energy with greater effectiveness; (2) diversify the sources of the energy supply of the United States to strengthen energy security and to increase supplies of energy with a favorable balance of environmental effects if the entire technology system is considered; or (3) contribute to a stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations through reduction, avoidance, or long-term sequestration of energy-related emissions. Requires the Under Secretary, consistent with the National Export Initiative, to provide information and other assistance under the Program to businesses, particularly businesses with no more than 500 employees, to promote the production and exportation of such technologies and related services."
