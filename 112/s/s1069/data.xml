  <summary>5/25/2011--Introduced.
Affordable Footwear Act of 2011 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the reduction or elimination of duties on certain imported footwear will result in reduced retail prices for a wide range of U.S. consumers. Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to provide for temporary duty-free or reduced-duty treatment of certain footwear (including children's shoes) made of rubber or plastics that are imported into the United States. Deems the outer sole of shoes made of rubber or plastics to which textile materials are attached or incorporated to be made only of rubber or plastics, with no account taken of the textile materials.</summary>
