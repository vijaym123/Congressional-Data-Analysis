(Sec. 103) Allows the DNI to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY2012 (by not more than 3%) when necessary for the performance of important intelligence functions. Authorizes the DNI to employ additional personnel to convert to performance by intelligence community (IC) personnel activities currently performed by contractor employees. Requires notification of the congressional intelligence committees in either case. Requires the DNI to establish guidelines to govern the treatment under authorized personnel levels of employment or assignment in: (1) a student program, trainee program, or similar program; (2) a reserve corps or as a reemployed annuitant; or (3) details, joint duty, or long term, full-time training. (Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account for FY2012, as well as for full-time personnel for elements within such Account. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY2012 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. Title III: General Intelligence Community Matters - (Sec. 301) Prohibits the authorization of appropriations by this Act from being deemed to constitute authority to conduct any intelligence activity not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. (Sec. 302) Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. (Sec. 303) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to allow the DNI, in order to carry out intelligence functions, to: (1) convert competitive service positions within an IC element to excepted service positions, and (2) establish new excepted service positions within an IC element. (Sec. 304) Requires, for IC major system acquisitions requiring a service or capability from another acquisition or program to deliver end-to-end functionality for IC end users, independent cost estimates to include all estimated costs to develop, acquire, procure, operate, and sustain the system across all pertinent IC elements. (Sec. 305) Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the the Secretary of State (current law) and the DNI to jointly provide to the President an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement relating to a proposed Civilian Nuclear Agreement (nuclear cooperation) with another country or multinational organization. Requires: (1) the classified annex required to accompany each Statement to be prepared jointly by the Secretary and the DNI, and (2) the text of the proposed Agreement to be submitted to the intelligence communities (under current law, only to the foreign relations committees). (Sec. 306) Amends the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 and the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 to require 30 days' advance notification to Congress prior to the transfer of a detainee at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (Guantanamo), to another country. Requires such notification to include the terms of any detainee monitoring assurance provided by the receiving country, as well as the federal agency or department responsible for carrying out the transfer agreement. (Sec. 307) Amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 to require the DNI, at least semiannually, to update and make publicly available an unclassified summary relating to terrorist recidivism of former Guantanamo detainees.

(Sec. 309) Authorizes the heads of IC elements outside of DOD, in conducting intelligence and intelligence-related activities, to: (1) take certain procurement actions with respect to information technology or systems in order to reduce the risk that an enemy or adversary may sabotage, maliciously introduce unwanted functions, or otherwise subvert IC information systems; and (2) limit the disclosure of information concerning the basis for taking such actions. Requires any IC element head, before taking such action, to: (1) determine that the use of such authority is necessary to protect national security by reducing supply chain risk and that less intrusive measures are not reasonably available, and (2) notify the DNI and the intelligence committees of such determination. Terminates such authority on January 7, 2014. (Sec. 310) Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to report to the intelligence committees on current burial allowances for federal civilian or military personnel.

(Sec. 412) Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to authorize the CIA Director to accept and use gifts for the welfare of CIA employees injured in the line of duty without the requirement that such gifts be used for the general welfare of all CIA employees. Allows such gifts to be used to assist the families of CIA officers who were injured or died from hostile or terrorist activities or in connection with other at-risk intelligence activities. Requires such gift use to be consistent with all relevant ethical constraints and principles, including: (1) the avoidance of any prohibited conflict of interest or appearance of impropriety, and (2) a prohibition against the acceptance of a gift from a foreign government or agent thereof. (Sec. 413) Requires the CIA to establish and maintain on its public website information relating to the CIA Office of the Inspector General, including means of contact.
