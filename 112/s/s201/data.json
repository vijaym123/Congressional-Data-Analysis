Grants the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, exclusive jurisdiction to manage the Craigin Project in accordance with the Arizona Water Settlements Act. Defines the \"Craigin Project\" to include the Craigin Dam, its reservoir pool, and Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District or Bureau of Reclamation structures and facilities used for the Project. Requires that Secretary and the District to ensure the compliance of each activity carried out at the Project with applicable federal environmental law. Grants the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, administrative jurisdiction over land management activities on the covered land and other appropriate management activities that do not conflict with, or adversely affect, the operation, maintenance, or replacement (including repair) of the Project. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the District, to enter into an agreement under which the Secretary of Agriculture may: (1) undertake any other appropriate management activity in accordance with applicable law that will improve the management and safety of the covered land and other land managed by the Secretary of Agriculture if the activity does not conflict with, or adversely affect, the operation, maintenance, or replacement (including repair) of the Project; and (2) carry out any emergency activities on the covered land."
