Keeping Politics Out of Federal Contracting Act of 2011 - Prohibits&#160;the head of an executive agency from: (1) requiring a contractor to submit political information as part of a solicitation, request for bid, request for proposal, or any other communication in connection with the award of a contract for procurement of property or services, during the course of the contract performance, or at any time prior to contract completion and final contract closeout; (2) using such political information as a factor or consideration in the source selection process used to award a competitive or non-competitive contract or in making any decision associated with the modification of a contract or the exercise of a contract option; or (3) including such political information in&#160;a contracting past performance database or any database designed to provide information to a contracting officer for purposes of supporting a responsibility determination.&#160; Defines "political information" as information relating to political spending, including any payment for an electioneering communication, by a contractor or persons related to such contractor to a candidate for federal office, a political committee, a political party, or to a third party entity for political purposes. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as: (1) waiving, superseding, restricting, or limiting the application of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 or preventing federal regulatory or law enforcement agencies from collecting or receiving information authorized by law; or (2) precluding the Defense Contract Audit Agency or other auditor from assessing and reviewing information to identify unallowable costs and administering cost principles.</summary>
