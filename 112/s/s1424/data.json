    "text": "Off-Reservation Land Acquisition Guidance Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to consider anticipated tribal benefits and applicable state and local government concerns before taking off-reservation land into trust for Indian tribes. Defines \"off-reservation land\" as land that is beyond a reasonable commuting distance from the applicable tribe's reservation and likely to be used for gaming. Requires an Indian tribe requesting that such land be taken into trust for the tribe to disclose and submit to the Secretary: (1) any plan, contract, agreement, or other information relating to the use, or intended use, of such land by the tribe; (2) a request for a written opinion from the Office of Indian Gaming that the land is eligible for gaming; and (3) any other information the Secretary requires in rendering a decision. Requires a tribe's proposed use of the land to be compatible with state and local planning and zoning, and public health and safety requirements. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to carry out this Act before approving any application to take off-reservation land into trust for Indian tribes."
