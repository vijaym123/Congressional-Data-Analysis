Requires each owner or operator of such unit that is subject to any emissions standard for hazardous air pollutants to submit: (1) a draft implementation plan for the expeditious implementation of the applicable emissions reduction requirements to the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) by July 1, 2012 for review, (2) a revised plan to the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy (DOE) by December 1, 2012, and (3) a report describing the progress made in implementing the plan to the Administrator and the Secretary by December 1, 2014, and annually thereafter. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Administrator: (1) a final implementation plan no later than 60 days after submission of a draft plan to ERO, and (2) a report on progress on implementing emissions control measures in a manner that ensures the reliability of the local and regional electricity systems by March 31, 2015, and annually thereafter through 2018."
