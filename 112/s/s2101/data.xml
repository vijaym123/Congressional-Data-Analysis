Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Human Rights Act of 2012 - Title I: Expansion of Multilateral Sanctions Regime with Respect to Iran - (Sec. 101) Declares that it is U.S. policy to: (1) prevent Iran from acquiring or developing nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and advanced conventional weapons; and (2) implement all sanctions against Iran in order to compel Iran to abandon nuclear weapons efforts and to cease support for terrorism. (Sec. 102) Expresses the sense of Congress that compelling Iran to abandon its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons capability and other threatening activities can be achieved through the implementation and intensification of enforcement of a multilateral sanctions regime. (Sec. 103) Urges the President to initiate diplomatic efforts to expand the multilateral sanctions regime regarding Iran. (Sec. 104) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should seek to maximize the effects of existing sanctions on Iran, and (2) the United States should take all necessary measures to preserve information-sharing activities. Title II: Expansion of Sanctions Relating to the Energy Sector of Iran and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction by Iran - Subtitle A: Expansion of Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 - (Sec. 201) Amends the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 to impose specified sanctions on a person that knowingly participates in certain petroleum resource development joint ventures outside of Iran if the Iranian government is a substantial partner or investor in the joint venture, or if Iran could, through such joint venture, receive new technology or equipment that could significantly contribute to its development of petroleum resources in Iran. (Sec. 202) Imposes specified sanctions on a person that knowingly sells, leases, or provides to Iran certain petroleum and infrastructure development-related resources goods, services, technology, or support: (1) any of which has a fair market value of $1 million or more; or (2) that, during a 12-month period, have an aggregate fair market value of $5 million or more. Imposes specified sanctions on a person knowingly selling, leasing, or providing to Iran certain petrochemical development-related goods, services, technology, or support: (1) any of which has a fair market value of $250,000 or more; or (2) that, during a 12-month period, have an aggregate fair market value of $1 million or more. (Sec. 203) Imposes specified sanctions on a person knowingly participating in certain joint ventures with Iran's government, Iranian entities, or persons acting for or on behalf of Iran in the mining, production, or transportation of uranium. Exempts a person from sanctions if the person withdraws from such joint ventures within 180 days after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 204) Authorizes the President to: (1) direct the Secretary of State to exclude from the United States an alien who is a corporate officer, principal, or controlling shareholder in a sanctioned firm; and (2) impose sanctions against the principal executive officer or other principal executive officers of a sanctioned firm.

Authorizes the President to waive such provisions if in the U.S. national security interest. (Sec. 212) Amends the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 to impose sanctions on entities controlled or owned by a person sanctioned by U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Iran. (Sec. 213) Prohibits an entity owned or controlled by a U.S. person and established or maintained outside the United States from engaging in any transaction with Iran or a person under Iran's jurisdiction that would be prohibited if the transaction were engaged in by a U.S. person or in the United States. Imposes specified civil penalties for violations of such prohibition. Exempts a person from such provisions if the person divests or terminates its business with the entity within 180 days after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 214) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require securities issuers to disclose in detail in their mandatory annual or quarterly reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whether they or their affiliates have: (1) engaged in certain activities relating to Iran, terrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; (2) knowingly engaged in specified activities, or knowingly violated certain regulations prescribed under the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010; (3) knowingly conducted any transaction or dealing with a person whose property and interests in property are blocked by certain Executive Orders; or (4) knowingly conducted a transaction or dealing with any person listed in the Iranian Transactions Regulations. Requires: (1) an issuer to disclose in a separate SEC filing that any such activity has been included in an annual or quarterly report, (2) the SEC to transit the report to the President and Congress, and (3) the President to initiate an investigation into the possible imposition of sanctions. (Sec. 215) Directs the President to publish a list of senior Iranian officials (and family members) involved in Iran's: (1) illicit nuclear activities or WMD proliferation, (2) support for international terrorism, or (3) human rights abuses against Iranian citizens. Prohibits such persons from being granted U.S. immigration status for admission. Authorizes the President to waive such provisions if in the U.S. national interest. (Sec. 216) Sets forth reporting requirements regarding: (1) financial communications services to the Central Bank of Iran; (2) foreign entities investing in Iran's energy sector; and (3) petroleum imports to, and exports from, Iran.

Requires investigative priority for foreign persons: (1) identified with the government of Iran; and (2) who have conducted transactions with Iran relating to petroleum, petrochemicals, energy resources, finances, nuclear, chemical or ballistic weapons, or sensitive technologies. (Sec. 302) Directs the President to identify and impose specified mandatory and discretionary sanctions upon a foreign person who knowingly: (1) assists or engages in any significant transactions with the IRGC or its agents and affiliates, (2) engages in any significant transactions with a person subject to U.N. sanctions relating to Iran. Authorizes the President to waive the imposition of sanctions if the person has terminated the activity or for reasons of U.S. national security. (Sec. 303) Prohibits anything in this subtitle from being construed to limit the President's authority to designate foreign persons for the imposition of sanctions pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Subtitle B: Additional Measures Relating to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps - (Sec. 311) Amends the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 to require certification by prospective U.S. government contractors that neither they nor their subsidiaries have engaged in significant economic transactions with the IRGC, or its officials, agents, or affiliates whose property is blocked pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. (Sec. 312) Amends the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to determine whether the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) or the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) is an IRGC agent or affiliate and submit such determination to Congress. States that such provisions shall apply to petroleum transactions for NIOC or NITC 180 days after enactment of this Act, but only if the President determines that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products in countries other than Iran to permit purchasers to significantly reduce petroleum and petroleum product purchases from Iran. Title IV: Measures Relating to Human Rights Abuses in Iran - Subtitle A: Expansion of Sanctions Relating to Human Rights Abuses in Iran - (Sec. 401) Amends the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 to direct the President to identify and submit a list to Congress of persons who have knowingly transferred to Iran goods or technology, or provided post-transfer services, that are likely to be used by the government of Iran to commit human rights abuses.
