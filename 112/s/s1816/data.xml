  <summary>11/7/2011--Introduced.
Amends the federal-aid highway program to modify the minimum penalties states are required to impose on motorists convicted multiple times for driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol. Requires repeat offenders to have: (1) all their driving privileges suspended (currently, a driver's license suspension) for at least one year; or (2) a combination of suspension of unlimited driving privileges for one year, allowing for reinstatement of limited driving privileges, subject to restrictions and limited exemptions as established under state law, if an ignition interlock device is installed for at least one year on each of the motor vehicles they own or operate. Eliminates the current alternative of a combination of suspension of all driving privileges for the first 45 days of the suspension period followed by a reinstatement of limited driving privileges for the purpose of getting to and from work, school, or an alcohol treatment program if an ignition interlock device is installed on each of the motor vehicles owned or operated, or both, by the individual.</summary>
