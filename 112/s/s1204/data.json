    "text": "Department of Defense Energy Security Act of 2011 - Requires the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to carry out and designate a lead officer for a pilot project assessing the feasibility and advisability of various joint and multi-service mechanisms to decrease energy usage by deployed military units, including by minimizing at forward operating bases the production of waste water, consumption of drinking water, energy, and materials, and reducing impacts on habitat and perimeter security and by maximizing capacity and effectiveness while promoting operational independence from supply lines and minimizing the resource footprint. Requires the Secretary to identify hybrid-drive technologies suitable for incorporation into the next reset and recap of motor vehicles of the current military services tactical fleet. Authorizes provisions of this Act to be waived if: (1) the Secretary certifies to Congress regarding an adverse impact on national security, or (2) the Director of National Intelligence determines an intelligence activity exemption is necessary to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure. Prohibits, beginning on October 1, 2017, the Secretary, the Secretary of a military department, or the head of a defense agency from procuring non-tactical motor vehicles or buses without electric or hybrid propulsion or alternative propulsion meeting or exceeding Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. Sets forth conditions for preferred propulsion systems and waivers by the Secretary. Extends to 15 years the maximum period of a contract for storage, handling, or distribution of liquid fuels or natural gas, subject to renewal restrictions. Directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy, Plans, and Programs to chair and prescribe a policy for a joint task force for alternative fuel development, consisting of the Secretaries of the military departments, the Assistant Secretary for Research and Engineering, and other appropriate members. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prescribe specified energy efficiency standards for designing, constructing, and renovating Department of Defense (DOD) facilities, (2) modify at least annually a list energy-efficient products for such projects, and (3) conduct an energy metering study. Sets forth curriculum and certification standards for energy managers. Specifies dates by which the DOD must meet certain milestones before achieving its renewable energy goal by FY2025. Authorizes the Secretary of a military department, subject to energy security considerations and other conditions, to develop DOD renewable energy sources within lands under the Secretary's jurisdiction, including public lands. Requires the Secretary to identify locations on military installations and ranges for such energy production and development. Defines: (1) \"renewable energy\" as solar, wind, geothermal, marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy, qualified hydropower, biomass, or landfill gas; and (2) \"energy security,\" generally, as assured access to reliable supplies of energy and the ability to protect and deliver sufficient energy to meet operational needs. Directs the Secretary to establish a policy to favorably consider energy security in the design and development of renewable energy projects on military installations and ranges. Eliminates the DOD Secretary approval required before the Secretary of a military department may enter into certain contracts for energy or fuel for military installations."
