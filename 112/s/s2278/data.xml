  <summary>3/29/2012--Introduced.
Amends the Truth in Lending Act with respect to the requirement that a creditor, in connection with the consummation of a consumer credit transaction secured by a first lien on the consumer's principal dwelling (other than under an open end credit plan or a reverse mortgage) establish an escrow or impound account for the payment of taxes, hazard insurance, and specified other insurance premiums, if any. Directs the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to exempt from this escrow or impound account requirement any loan secured by a first lien on a consumer's principal dwelling if the loan is held by a smaller insured depository institution having assets of $10 billion or less.</summary>
