Fort Sumner Project Title Conveyance Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey to the Fort Sumner Irrigation District, located in De Baca County, New Mexico, all works, land, and facilities of the Fort Sumner reclamation project in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the United States and the Fort Sumner Irrigation District Concerning Principles and Elements of Proposed Transfer of Title to Fort Sumner Irrigation District Facilities. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress if such conveyance isn't completed within one year. Terminates, on the date of such conveyance: (1) U.S. interest in, responsibility for, and liability relating to such property; (2) a specified repayment contract between the United States and the District dated November 5, 1948; and (3) a specified payment obligation of the United States under the contract between the United States and the District for the forbearance of exercising priority water rights, dated August 21, 2009. Provides that all other terms of such forbearance agreement shall remain in effect for not less than 10 years after this Act's enactment. Prohibits, effective on the date of such conveyance, any additional amounts from the reclamation fund established by the Act of June 17, 1902, from being provided for the conveyed land or facilities due to their status as part of a reclamation project.</summary>
