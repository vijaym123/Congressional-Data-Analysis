Specifies acceptable forms of property, cash, and in-kind consideration. Directs the Secretary to determine fair market value based on a highest- and best-use appraisal in conformance with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Professional Appraisal Practice. Directs that any proceeds the United States receives as such consideration be available to the Secretary, subject to appropriation, for the acquisition, through lease or by purchase of real property, and associated design and construction of a new port facility in the Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska, that is under the administrative jurisdiction of the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere. Requires the exact acreage and legal description of any property so conveyed to be determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to bear the cost of such survey. Permits the Secretary, as appropriate to protect the interest of the United States, to: (1) exchange all or any portion of the real property, and (2) require additional terms and conditions with any such conveyance."
