  <summary>7/12/2011--Introduced.
Battery Innovation Act of 2011 - Sets forth a research, development, demonstration, and commercial application (R&amp;D) program for advanced batteries. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) to direct the Secretary of Energy (DOE) (Secretary) to implement a grants program for domestic lithium R&amp;D for use in advanced battery technologies. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to identify the raw materials needed for the manufacture of plug-in electric drive vehicles, batteries, and other components for such vehicles, including the infrastructure needed to support them. Directs the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to fund high-risk, high-reward research and development programs supporting the manufacture of plug-in electric drive vehicles and charging infrastructure. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) make discretionary cash awards in recognition of advanced battery breakthrough achievements, and (2) establish energy innovation hubs. Establishes the Battery Achievement Award Fund. Directs the Secretary to conduct R&amp;D regarding: (1) materials, technologies, and processes with the potential to reduce substantially or eliminate petroleum use and the emissions of the passenger and commercial vehicles of the United States, (2) connectivity of vehicle and transportation systems, (3) advanced vehicle manufacturing technologies and practices; and (4) advanced technologies for medium- to heavy-duty vehicles. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a competitive grant program to demonstrate the integration of multiple advanced technologies on Class 8 truck and trailer platforms with a goal of improving overall freight efficiency by 50%, (2) engage in specified testing to evaluate the performance of advanced heavy vehicle technologies, and (3) undertake a pilot R&amp;D program to improve total machine or system efficiency for nonroad mobile equipment. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make grants for the manufacture of advanced batteries and components, (2) provide facility funding awards to manufacturers of advanced battery systems and vehicle batteries produced in the United States, and (3) conduct an R&amp;D program that builds upon work carried out pursuant to a specified secondary electric vehicle battery use program. Amends EISA to direct the Secretary to guarantee loans made to eligible entities for the purchase of at least 200 qualified automotive batteries with a total minimum power rating of 1 megawatt that use advanced battery technology.</summary>
