Requires the TPCC to: (1) identify opportunities to consolidate or co-locate offices of federal agencies involved in export promotion and export financing activities; (2) assess the use and coordination of electronic databases among federal agencies in support of such activities; and (3) provide a detailed listing of current and future federal and state-led trade missions, trade fairs, and related activities to ensure better delivery of services to U.S. businesses. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to make available information on federal and state-led trade missions, trade fairs, and related activities on the Export.gov website. Requires the governmentwide strategic plan for federal trade promotion efforts to: (1) clearly identify and explain the role, goals, and objectives of each TPCC member agency with respect its export promotion and export financing activities; (2) include any recommendations of the Comptroller General relating to coordination of the TPCC and member agencies; and (3) reflect the recommendations of the U.S. Travel Association (currently, U.S. National Tourism Organization) to the degree considered appropriate by the TPCC. Revises membership of the TPCC to include one member that represents state agencies with responsibility for export promotion and export financing. Requires the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce to report annually to Congress on the extent to which the TPCC is successfully carrying out its duties. Requires certain reports to Congress: (1) on recommendations for improving access about export information (including state resources) on the Export.gov website, and (2) for developing a single website for complying with and disseminating information about U.S. export control laws and regulations. Amends the Small Business Act to require that the nationwide marketing effort of the Associate Administrator of the Office of International Trade of the Small Business Administration (SBA), in promoting sales opportunities for the export of small business goods and services, to conduct at least one outreach event each fiscal year in each state.
