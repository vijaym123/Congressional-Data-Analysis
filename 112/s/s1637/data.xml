Appeal Time Clarification Act of 2011 -Amends federal judicial code requirements concerning the time limits for the filing of appeals to any judgment, order, or decree in a civil action, suit, or proceeding in which the United States or a U.S. officer or agency is a party. Revises the requirement that an appeal in any such action, suit, or proceeding be filed within 60 days after entry of judgment, order, or decree. Extends application of the 60-day filing deadline to any civil action, suit, or proceeding in which one of the parties is: (1) a U.S. employee sued in an official capacity; or (2) a current or former U.S. officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on behalf of the United States, including all instances in which the United States represents that officer or employee when the judgment, order, or decree is entered or files the appeal for that person. Sets forth the finding of Congress that the application of the 60-day deadline: (1) is not limited to civil actions in which representation of the United States is provided by the Department of Justice (DOJ); and (2) includes all civil actions in which the representation of the United States is provided by a federal legal officer acting in an official capacity, including civil actions in which a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate or the House of Representatives is represented by the Office of Senate Legal Counsel or the House's Office of General Counsel.</summary>
