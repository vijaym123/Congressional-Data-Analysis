Increases such reduction from 2% to 3.1% Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose on individual taxpayers between 2012 and 2022 an additional tax equal to 1.9% of so much of their modified adjusted gross income in excess of $1 million. Provides for an inflation adjustment to the $1 million threshold amount for taxable years beginning after 2013. Defines "modified adjusted gross income" as adjusted gross income reduced by any deduction allowed for investment interest. Imposes a 50% tax (55% for a taxable year beginning in 2011 or 2012) on any unemployment compensation received by a taxpayer with an adjusted gross income of at least $1 million. Denies a tax deduction for the payment of such tax. Amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to render ineligible for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP), formerly food stamps, any household in which a member receives income or assets with a fair market value of at least $1 million. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to require until October 1, 2021, a phased increase in the fees charged to mortgage lenders by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) to guarantee payment of new mortgage loans.</summary>
