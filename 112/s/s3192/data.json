Requires an F-4 alien to demonstrate an intent to: (1) return to his or her country of residence upon completion or termination of such qualifying graduate program, or (2) obtain U.S. employment in a STEM field and become a permanent U.S. resident upon completion of the graduate program which was the basis for such nonimmigrant status. States that an F-4 visa shall be valid: (1) during the intended period of graduate study, (2) for an additional one year period if the alien is pursuing an offer of STEM field employment, and (3) for an additional six month period while the alien's application for permanent resident status adjustment is pending. States that an alien shall qualify for permanent resident status adjustment if he or she: (1) has F-4 status and has earned an advanced STEM field degree at an institution of higher education, and (2) is employed full-time in the United States in a STEM field position."
