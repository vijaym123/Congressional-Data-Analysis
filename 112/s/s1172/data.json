Prohibits the Secretary from: (1) seeking a remand without the appellant's agreement if such a written report is submitted, and (2) opposing any subsequent filing by the appellant for specified fees and other expenses under the federal judicial code if the Secretary seeks a remand after the seven-day period. Allows the CAVC to impose sanctions, including money sanctions, if the Secretary fails to comply with this Act."
