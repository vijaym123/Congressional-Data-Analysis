Converts certain existing temporary judgeships for the district of Arizona and the central district of California to permanent judgeships. Increases the filing fee for most civil actions or proceedings, excluding a writ of habeas corpus, to $360 (currently, $350). Requires that incremental amounts collected by reason of enactment of this Act be deposited in a special fund in the Treasury to offset funds appropriated for the operation and maintenance of U.S. courts to the extent specifically appropriated by an Act of Congress after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 3) Prohibits any judicial branch officer, employee, agent, contractor, or subcontractor from discharging, demoting, threatening, suspending, harassing, or otherwise discriminating against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act by the employee to provide information, cause information to be provided, or otherwise assist in an investigation regarding any possible violation of federal law or regulation, or misconduct, by a judge, justice, or any other employee in the judicial branch, which may assist in the investigation of the possible violation or misconduct. Authorizes an employee injured by such a prohibited act to obtain appropriate relief in a civil action."
