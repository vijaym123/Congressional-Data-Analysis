  <summary>3/21/2012--Introduced.
Instructs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to use its authority (including emergency powers) to: (1) to curb immediately the role of excessive speculation in any contract market within its jurisdiction and control that is serving as a platform for the trading of energy futures or swaps; and (2) eliminate excessive speculation, price distortion, sudden or unreasonable fluctuations, unwarranted changes in prices, or other unlawful activity that is causing major market disturbances that prevent the market from accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand for energy commodities.</summary>
