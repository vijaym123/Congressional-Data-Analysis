    "text": "Freedom from Tolls Act of 2011 - Prohibits the use of highway funds to impose a toll on any segment of a federal-aid system highway that as of enactment of this Act: (1) has had its construction completed, (2) is not tolled, (3) was constructed with federal assistance, and (4) is in actual operation. Excepts from this prohibition, thus allowing tolls on, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes as well as any highway segment that, as of the date on which a toll is imposed on it, will have the same number of non-toll lanes as were in existence before that date. Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century to decrease from three to two the number of facilities a state may establish on a highway, bridge, or tunnel on the Interstate System to collect tolls for reconstructing and rehabilitating Interstate highway corridors under the Interstate System reconstruction and rehabilitation pilot program."
