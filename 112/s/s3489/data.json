Requires such guidelines and procedures to provide that identification of an Administration field office for possible closure shall not require the Commissioner to begin closure procedures for it. Requires the Commissioner to: (1) develop an office closure and service continuity proposal for any office so identified which the Commissioner decides to close that contains, among other specified items, the estimated cost of the closure; (2) notify state and local chief executive offices and the public before closure; (3) require the Commissioner to hold at least one hearing to take public comments before making a final decision to close a field office; (5) issue a final closure decision only after review of such comments and evaluation of any alternatives to closing the office; and (6) continue to operate an office proposed for closure in good faith and with the assumption of continued service until the notice of the Commisioner's final closure decision is made."
