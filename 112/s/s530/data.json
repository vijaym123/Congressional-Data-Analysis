Requires the President to: (1) reduce semiannually the temporary duty imposed on ethanol by an amount equal to the reduction in any federal income or excise tax credit for alcohol and ethanol blends used as fuel; and (2) take other actions necessary to ensure that the combined temporary duty and any other duty imposed on ethanol is equal to, or lower than, any federal income or excise tax credit applicable to ethanol."
