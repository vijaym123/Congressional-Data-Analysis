Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act or MAP-21 - Division A: Federal-Aid Highways and Highway Safety Construction Programs - Title I: Federal-Aid Highways - Subtitle A: Authorizations and Programs - (Sec. 1101) Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) (other than the Mass Transit Account) equal to current federal highway spending levels plus inflation for FY2012 and FY2013 for: (1) certain new and existing core federal-aid highway programs; (2) the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation program; (3) the federal lands, tribal transportation, and federal lands access programs; and (4) the territorial and Puerto Rico highway program. Requires the expenditure of 10% of amounts made available for federal-aid highways and public transportation programs on small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Requires states to compile annual lists of small disadvantaged business enterprises according to minimum uniform criteria established by the Secretary of Transportation (DOT). (Sec. 1102) Prescribes obligation ceilings for federal-aid highway and highway safety construction programs, with specified exceptions. Prescribes requirements, including a formula, and restrictions for certain FY2012 and FY2013 distributions from the obligation limitation for federal-aid highways. Requires the Secretary to redistribute to the states any federal-aid highway program funds that, because of the imposition of any obligation limitation, will not be allocated or otherwise made available for obligation to them for surface transportation program projects. (Sec. 1104) Revises the National Highway System (NHS) program. Repeals the maximum mileage of 178,250 miles for NHS highways. Eliminates authority to add new congressional high-priority corridors. Repeals the specification of uses of obligated federal funds for state and territory eligible NHS projects. Repeals specified authority for the transfer to a state's apportionment of certain Interstate construction funds, whether in surplus or not. Amends the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 to designate as future Interstate Route I-11 certain Arizona and Nevada segments of the CANAMEX Corridor. (Sec. 1105) Authorizes appropriations for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) administrative expenses. Directs the Secretary to distribute federal-aid highway funds apportioned to states for each fiscal year: (1) among the national highway performance (new core program), the transportation mobility (new core program), the highway safety improvement, the national freight (new core program), and the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement (CMAQ) programs; as well as (2) to metropolitan transportation planning. (Sec. 1106) Directs the Secretary to establish and implement a national highway performance program. (Effectively consolidates the interstate maintenance, NHS, and part of the highway bridge programs.) Requires states to develop risk-based asset management plans that include strategies leading to projects that would make progress toward achieving state targets and national goals to improve infrastructure condition and performance on the NHS. Requires a state to obligate a specified amount of the apportionment of national highway performance program funds for the restoration of certain Interstate System (IS) pavement and NHS bridges. (Sec. 1107) Revises the emergency relief fund program. Reauthorizes appropriations for the emergency relief fund for the repair or reconstruction of highways, roads, and trails damaged as a result of a disaster. Authorizes the Secretary to obligate fund amounts for the repair or reconstruction of disaster-affected tribal transportation facilities, federal lands transportation facilities, and other federally-owned roads that are open to public travel, whether or not they are federal-aid highways. (Sec. 1108) Directs the Secretary to establish and implement a transportation mobility program (TMP). (Effectively replaces the surface transportation program.) Authorizes a state to obligate the apportionment of TMP funds for projects to improve conditions and performance on federal-aid highways and bridges and tunnels on public roads. Makes certain TMP allocations to areas of a state based on population. Requires a state to obligate a specified amount of the apportionment of TMP funds for the improvement of certain deficient off-system bridges. (Sec. 1109) Requires the Secretary to deduct a certain amount from FHWA administrative funds per fiscal year (instead of whenever certain apportionments are made) for: (1) surface transportation and technology on-the-job training programs, and (2) training programs for minority business enterprises to achieve proficiency to compete for federal-aid highway contracts and subcontracts. (Sec. 1110) Directs the Secretary to deduct for each of FY2012-FY2013 at least $10 million from FHWA administrative expenses for highway use tax evasion projects. (Sec. 1111) Revises the highway bridge program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) inventory all highway bridges and tunnels, (2) establish national inspection standards for evaluating all highway bridges and tunnels for safety and serviceability, and (3) establish a training program for highway bridge and tunnel inspectors. Authorizes a state to use TMP funds to replace certain bridges and ferries that have been destroyed. (Sec. 1112) Revises the highway safety improvement program. Directs the Secretary to establish requirements for regularly recurring updates and approval of state strategic highway safety plans. Requires the Secretary to issue guidance to states on establishing performance measures and targets for state highway safety improvement programs to reduce serious injuries and fatalities on highways. (Sec. 1113) Revises the CMAQ program. Requires states and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to give priority to projects that are proven to reduce PM2.5, including diesel retrofits, in areas designated as nonattainment or maintenance for PM2.5. Requires, also, that 50% of such funds be suballocated for projects to reduce fine particulate matter emissions within areas designated as nonattainment or maintenance for ozone, carbon monoxide, or PM2.5, including diesel retrofits. Requires each tier I MPO representing a nonattainment or maintenance area (population of more than 50,000 individuals) to develop a performance plan that describes projects that will achieve certain emission and traffic congestion reduction targets. Authorizes a state to reserve a specified amount of CMAQ program funds for: (1) the transportation enhancements, recreational trails, and safe routes to school programs; and (2) planning, designing, or constructing boulevards and roadways largely in the right-of-way of former Interstate System routes or other divided highways. (Sec. 1114) Revises and replaces the Puerto Rico highway program with the Territorial and Puerto Rico highway program. (Effectively consolidates the programs.) Makes certain allocations for the Puerto Rico highway and territorial highway programs for resurfacing and reconstruction, highway safety improvement, transportation mobility program, preventive maintenance, and ferry boats and terminal facilities projects. (Sec. 1115) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a national freight program to improve movement of freight on highways, including freight intermodal connectors and aerotropolis transportation systems; and (2) develop, periodically update, and post on the Department of Transportation (DOT) website a national freight strategic plan. Defines "aerotropolis transportation system" as a planned and coordinated multimodal freight and passenger transportation network that provides efficient, cost-effective, sustainable, and intermodal connectivity to a defined region of economic significance centered around a major airport. Authorizes a state to obligate its apportionment of national freight program funds for projects to improve the movement of freight on the national freight network. Directs the Secretary to designate a primary freight network consisting of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways most critical to the movement of freight. Authorizes a state to designate a road within state borders, meeting specified criteria, as a critical rural freight corridor. Directs the Secretary to develop and post on the DOT public website a national freight strategic plan including specified assessments and best practices. Requires states to develop, and periodically update, state performance targets for freight movement on the primary freight network. Requires states that have not met or made significant progress toward meeting such targets, however, to submit biennially to the Secretary a freight performance improvement plan. Directs the Secretary to begin development of new transportation investment data and planning tools or to improve existing tools to support an outcome-oriented, performance-based approach to evaluate proposed freight-related and other transportation projects. (Sec. 1116) Revises requirements for making authorized funds available for the tribal transportation, federal lands transportation, and federal lands access programs for various transportation planning and highway improvement projects. (Sec. 1117) Revises requirements for the Alaska highway program. Authorizes the Secretary, upon agreement with the state of Alaska, to expend federal-aid highway funds apportioned to the state for necessary reconstruction on: (1) a specified segment of the Alaska Highway, or (2) the Alaska Marine Highway System. (Sec. 1118) Directs the Secretary to establish a grant program for eligible surface transportation infrastructure projects of national and regional significance. Authorizes appropriations for FY2013. Directs the Comptroller General and the DOT Inspector General separately to assess the establishment, solicitation, selection, and justification process with respect to the funding of such projects (Sec. 1119) Revises the formula for the allocation of federal-aid highway funds to states for construction of ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities. Directs the Secretary to establish within the FHWA a Ferry Boat Coordination Team to: (1) coordinate federal programs affecting ferry and ferry facility construction, maintenance, operations, and security; and (2) promote ferry transportation. Authorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2013. Revises requirements for the National Ferry Database to include information on federal, state, and local government funding sources for ferry systems. Requires the Secretary to ensure that the database is consistent with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) national transit database. Makes amounts for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics available for the database through FY2013. Subtitle B: Performance Management - (Sec. 1201) Revises metropolitan transportation planning and statewide transportation planning requirements. Requires designation of an MPO for each urbanized area with a population of more than 200,000 individuals and for small urbanized areas with populations between 50,000 and 200,000 individuals. (Currently, an MPO must be designated for each urbanized area with a population of more than 50,000 individuals.) Requires the Secretary to prescribe a rule that establishes certain minimum requirements (including population) for designation of a tier I and tier II MPO. Requires MPOs, in developing metropolitan transportation plans and transportation improvement programs (TIPs) for metropolitan planning areas, to use a process that establishes certain performance measures and targets for the metropolitan transportation planning of federal-aid highway projects. Authorizes funding. (Sec. 1202) Requires each state, in developing a statewide transportation plan and a statewide transportation improvement program (STIP), to use similar performance measures and targets for the statewide transportation planning of federal-aid highway projects. Requires each state to incorporate the metropolitan transportation plans and TIPs for each metropolitan area into the statewide transportation plan and STIP. Authorizes funding. (Sec. 1203) Declares that it is in the interest of the United States to focus the federal-aid highway program on certain national goals, including to: (1) significantly reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads, (2) maintain the highway infrastructure system in a state of good repair, (3) improve the efficiency of the surface transportation system, (4) improve the national freight network and support regional economic development, (5) enhance the performance of the transportation system while protecting the natural environment, and (6) reduce project delivery delays. Subtitle C: Acceleration of Project Delivery - (Sec. 1301) Directs the Secretary to carry out a project delivery acceleration initiative to identify, develop, and advance the use of best practices and deployment of technology and innovation to accelerate project delivery and to reduce project costs for transportation projects and programs while enhancing safety and protecting the environment. (Sec. 1302) Authorizes a public authority to acquire real property that may be used for an approved surface transportation project before completion of the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) for the project, if the acquisition does not: (1) have an adverse environmental effect, (2) limit the choice of reasonable alternatives for the proposed project, or (3) prevent the lead agency from making an impartial decision as to whether to select an alternative that is being considered during the environmental review process. (Sec. 1303) Authorizes a contracting agency (state transportation department) to award, on a competitive basis, a two-phase contract to a construction manager or general contractor for pre-construction and construction services on federal-aid highway projects. (Sec. 1304) Declares that it is in the national interest to promote the use of innovative technologies and practices that increase the efficiency of construction of, improve the safety of, and extend the service life of highways and bridges. Allows the federal share payable on account of a project or activity, at state discretion, to be up to 100% percent if it: (1) contains innovative project delivery methods that improve work zone safety for motorists or workers and the quality of the facility; (2) contains innovative technologies, manufacturing processes, financing, or contracting methods that improve the quality, extend the service life, or decrease the long-term costs of maintaining highways and bridges; (3) accelerates project delivery while complying with other applicable federal laws (including regulations) and not causing any significant adverse environmental impact; or (4) reduces congestion related to highway construction. (Sec. 1305) Revises requirements for the provision of federal funds at state request for a project subject to the environmental review process to support activities that directly and meaningfully contribute to expediting and improving transportation project planning and delivery for projects in that state. Requires the affected federal agency and the state agency, with respect to funds for dedicated staffing at that federal agency, to enter into a memorandum of understanding that establishes the projects and priorities to be addressed by the use of those funds. (Sec. 1306) Authorizes a multimodal project lead DOT authority (operating administration or secretarial office) to apply a categorical exclusion (that does not involve significant environmental impact), designated under the implementing regulations or procedures of a cooperating DOT authority that is not the lead authority, for other components of a multimodal transportation project if specified conditions are met. (A "categorical exclusion" under NEPA is a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementing environmental regulations and for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.) (Sec. 1307) Authorizes a state to terminate its assumption of responsibility for designating activities for categorical exclusion from requirements for environmental assessments or environmental impact statements. (Sec. 1308) Converts the surface transportation project delivery pilot program into a permanent program, making all states eligible to participate. Revises requirements for the written agreement between DOT and a state that assumed DOT responsibilities for environmental review, consultation, or other action required under any federal environmental law pertaining to the review or approval of a specific project. Requires the agreement to require the Secretary, after five years, to evaluate the state's ability to carry out those responsibilities. Repeals the requirement for periodic DOT compliance audits of participating states. Authorizes a state to terminate its participation in the program at any time by giving the Secretary a 90-days notice. (Sec. 1309) Directs the Secretary to publish notice of proposed rulemaking for categorical exclusions for federal-aid highway projects that are located solely within the right-of-way of an existing highway and are intended to improve safety, alleviate congestion, or improve pavement conditions. (Sec. 1310) Directs the Secretary to: (1) survey the DOT's use of categorical exclusions for transportation projects since 2005; and (2) publish a review of the survey, including any requests for new categorical exclusions. Requires the Secretary to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to propose new categorical exclusions received by the Secretary. (Sec. 1311) Prescribes procedures for accelerating the project delivery decisionmaking process with respect to: (1) environmental review of projects, (2) coordination among relevant agencies in meeting project deadlines, and (3) issue resolution and referral. (Sec. 1314) Directs the Secretary to establish an initiative to review and develop consistent procedures for environmental permitting and procurement requirements for DOT formula grant programs. Requires the Secretary to publish the initiative in an electronically accessible format. (Sec. 1315) Authorizes the Secretary to establish an alternative relocation payment demonstration program for the payment of relocation assistance to persons displaced by federally-assisted programs and projects. (Sec. 1316) Directs the Secretary to compare the completion times of categorical exclusions, environmental assessments, and environmental impact statements for federal-aid highway projects among specified time periods. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on such review, including any change in the timing for completions and reasons for any such change, as well as reasons for any delays in excess of five years. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the types and justification for additional categorical exclusions granted by the Secretary. Directs the Comptroller General and the DOT Inspector General each to assess the accelerated project delivery reforms made in this Act. Subtitle D: Highway Safety - (Sec. 1401) Expresses the sense of Congress that it is a national priority to address projects for the shortage of long-term parking for commercial motor vehicles on the NHS to improve the safety of motorized and nonmotorized users and for commercial motor vehicle operators. Makes eligible to be a federal-aid highway project the construction of long-term parking facilities for commercial motor vehicles on the NHS (Jason's Law). Directs the Secretary to survey and assess the availability of parking facilities for commercial motor vehicles in each state. Requires survey results be made available to the public on the DOT website. (Sec. 1402) Revises open container requirements. Requires the Secretary to withhold 2.5% (currently 3%) of a state's apportionment of national highway performance and surface transportation program funds if it has not enacted or is not enforcing a law that prohibits the possession of any open alcoholic beverage container, or the consumption of such beverage, in the passenger area of any motor vehicle on a public highway. Requires such funds to be withheld until the state certifies to DOT the means by which it will use those funds for: (1) alcohol-impaired driving countermeasures and enforcement activities, and (2) the state highway safety improvement program. (Sec. 1403) Amends the federal-aid highway program to modify the minimum penalties states are required to impose on motorists convicted multiple times for driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol. Requires repeat offenders to have: (1) all their driving privileges suspended (currently, only a driver's license suspension) for at least one year; or (2) their unlimited driving privileges suspended for one year, with limited driving privileges permitted, subject to restrictions and limited exemptions, if an ignition interlock device is installed for at least one year on each of the motor vehicles they own or operate. Eliminates the specified current alternative penalty of a combination of suspension of all driving privileges for the first 45 days of the suspension period followed by a reinstatement of limited driving privileges for the purpose of getting to and from work, school, or an alcohol treatment program if an ignition interlock device is installed on each of the motor vehicles owned or operated, or both, by the individual. Applies the same administrative penalties for state failure to enact or enforce a repeat intoxicated driver law as under Sec. 1402 for state failure to prohibit possession of any open alcoholic beverage container or consumption of the beverage in the passenger area of any motor vehicle on a public highway. (Sec. 1404) Revises and decreases certain penalties for state failure to enact and/or enforce specified laws regarding: (1) vehicle weight limitations; (2) control of junkyards near the NHS, including the Interstate Highway System; (3) certain other vehicle and size and weight requirements; (4) payment of the heavy vehicle use tax; (5) use of safety belts; (6) the national minimum drinking age; (7) suspension or revocation of the driver's licenses of drug offenders; (8) a zero tolerance blood alcohol concentration for minors; and (9) operation of motor vehicles by intoxicated persons. Revises penalties for state failure to comply with specified requirements regarding commercial driver's licenses. (Sec. 1405) Directs the Secretary to modify a specified regulation regarding Work Zone Safety Management Measures and Strategies to ensure that: (1) positive protective measures are used to separate workers on highway construction projects from motorized traffic in all work zones in areas that offer workers no means of escape (such as tunnels and bridges), unless an engineering study determines otherwise; (2) temporary longitudinal traffic barriers are used to protect workers on highway construction projects in long-duration stationary work zones when the project design speed is anticipated to be high and the nature of the work requires workers to be within one lane-width from the edge of a live travel lane, unless certain requirements are met; and (3) when positive protective devices are necessary for highway construction projects, those devices are paid for on a unit-pay basis, unless doing so would create a conflict with certain innovative contracting approaches. Subtitle E: Miscellaneous - (Sec. 1501) Revises the administrative penalty for a state's failure to commence on-site construction of, or acquisition of right-of-way for, a highway project within 10 years (or an approved reasonable longer period) after the date on which federal funds are first made available for preliminary engineering of the project. Requires the state to pay an amount equal to the amount of federal funds reimbursed for the preliminary engineering (currently, an amount equal to the amount of federal funds made available for such engineering). (Sec. 1502) Prohibits the Secretary from assigning responsibilities to a state for design, plans, specifications, estimates, contract awards, and inspections of interstate NHS projects deemed in a high risk category. Requires a state to develop and carry out a value engineering program with respect to NHS projects receiving federal assistance. Authorizes a state, subject to DOT project approval, to obligate funds to determine that subrecipients of federal funds have adequate project delivery systems and sufficient accounting controls to properly manage such funds. Makes the federal share of costs for such activities 100%. Allows the financial plan of a recipient of federal financial assistance for a major project with an estimated total cost of $500 million or more to include a phasing plan when applicable. (Sec. 1503) Requires the Secretary to ensure the use of practical highway project design solutions so that transportation needs are met and that funds available for such projects are used efficiently.
