Directs the Secretary to ensure that each VISN: (1) is aligned with the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the specific health care requirements of veterans in that network; (2) implements VA national goals within their network and associated medical centers; (3) maintains a regional integrated health care system; (4) identifies and reduces the duplication of functions in VHA clinical, administrative, and operational processes and practices; (5) works to achieve maximum effectiveness in patient care and safety, graduate medical education, and research; (6) assesses the consolidation or realignment of institutional functions, in collaboration and cooperation with other VISNs and specified offices or entities within their network; and (7) develops and shares innovations and best practices with each other at the local, regional, and national levels. Prohibits more than one headquarters for each VISN, with no more than 65 full-time employees. Requires the Secretary to report at least annually to the congressional veterans committees on employment at VISN headquarters. Directs the Secretary, at least every three years, to: (1) review and assess VISN structure and operations, and (2) submit review results to such committees. Requires the Secretary, in order to comply with the requirements of this Act, to realign and combine the current 21 VISNs into 12 geographically defined VISNs, and to appropriately consolidate VISN headquarters. Directs the Secretary to submit to such committees a realignment implementation plan. Provides for the relocation of leased VISN headquarters, requiring the Secretary to notify such committees if renewing or engaging in a new lease for any headquarters. Directs the Secretary to establish up to four regional support centers within the VHA to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the VISNs."
