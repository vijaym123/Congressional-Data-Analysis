Requires the Secretary of the Army to: (1) assign government-owned and operated Army factories and arsenals sufficient workload to ensure cost efficiency and technical competence in peacetime, while preserving the response ability described above; and (2) make Army arsenals available to DOD, the defense agencies, and military services for the procurement of supplies, components, parts, systems, and subsystems. Directs: (1) the Secretary to report annually to Congress on Army arsenal capabilities, workload, performance, and required capital investments; and (2) the Comptroller General to review each report for completeness and compliance and provide findings to the congressional defense committees."
