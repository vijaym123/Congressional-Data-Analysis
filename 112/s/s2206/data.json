Outlines information to be included in such counseling. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make such information available to the public. Repeals the $6 million fiscal year limit for VA contracting for such counseling services. Directs the Secretary to establish a system to collect, process, and track complaints submitted by individuals enrolled in VA programs of education to report instances of fraud, waste, and abuse with respect to benefits and services provided by educational institutions. Requires a state approving agency, when considering whether to approve a course of education at an educational institution, to review and take into consideration the complaints processed and tracked by such system. Provides for the confidentiality of such complaints."
