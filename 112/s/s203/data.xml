  <summary>1/26/2011--Introduced.
Responsible Arctic Energy Development Act of 2011 - Requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in collaboration with other federal agencies, to direct research and take action to improve oil spill prevention, response, and recovery in Arctic waters. Amends the Oil Polllution Act of 1990 to require the NOAA Administrator and the Commandant of the Coast Guard to use amounts made available under this Act for research and related activities in advance of energy exploration and production in the Arctic. Requires the Coast Guard to assess and take action to reduce the risk of, and improve U.S. response to, a maritime disaster in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Sets forth additional Interagency Committee Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research functions, including requiring the Committee to request the National Research Council to conduct an oil spill risk assessment and make recommendations that will enhance safety and lessen the potential adverse environmental impacts of industrial activities in Arctic waters.</summary>
