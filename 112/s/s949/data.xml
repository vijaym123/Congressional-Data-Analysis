National Oilheat Research Alliance Reauthorization Act of 2011 - Renames the National Oilheat Research Alliance Act of 2000 the National Oilheat Research, Consumer Education, and Efficiency Act of 2011. Revises criteria for membership in the National Oilheat Research Alliance. Directs the Alliance to: (1) submit proposed biennial (currently, annual) budgets to the Secretary of Energy (DOE); and (2) maintain a data collection process to track equipment, service, and related safety issues. Authorizes the Secretary to recommend changes to budget programs and activities of the Alliance. Directs the Secretary to report biennially to Congress on certain Alliance activities. Prohibits assessments collected under this Act from being passed through to or otherwise required to be paid by either retail purchasers or ultimate consumers of oilheat. Requires a qualified state association to deposit in a separate account the funds received under this Act. Directs the Alliance to ensure that specified percentages of assessments collected for each calendar year are used to: (1) conduct research, development, and demonstration activities relating to oilheat; (2) implement consumer assistance programs; and (3) conduct consumer education activities relating to oilheat. Directs the Alliance to: (1) ensure that heating system conversion assistance is coordinated with administrators of a specified low-income home energy assistance program and with the Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income Persons; and (2) develop, with states, a coordinated heating oil efficiency and upgrade plan to implement cost-effective efficiency programs and activities. Repeals the mandate for an annual market survey and analysis of changes in the price of oilheat relative to other energy sources. Prohibits the use of funds derived from assessments collected by the Alliance to lobby. Authorizes the Secretary to impose a fine or take other action to ensure compliance with this Act (including referral to an appropriate law enforcement authority) if the Alliance, a qualified state association, or any other entity or person violates this Act. Extends the sunset date for the National Oilheat Research Alliance program to 19 years after the date on which it was established.</summary>
