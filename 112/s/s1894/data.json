Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) impose liability on, and grant U.S. district courts personal jurisdiction over, any person who aids, abets, provides material support or resources to, or conspires with a person who commits an act of international terrorism that injures a U.S. national; (2) repeal provisions prohibiting civil actions against foreign states or foreign officials for damages related to acts of terrorism; and (3) extend from 4 to 15 years the limitation period for bringing an action for civil damages resulting from an act of international terrorism and allow previously time-barred cases that would have been timely filed under such extended limitation period to be refiled within 90 days of the enactment of this Act."
