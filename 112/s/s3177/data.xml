  <summary>5/15/2012--Introduced.
Stopping Ongoing Lender Delays Act or SOLD Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require each servicer of a home mortgage to respond in writing within 30 days to a mortgagor of a residential mortgage loan who hasrequested in writing a short sale of the dwelling or residential real property that is subject to the mortgage, deed of trust, or other security interest securing the mortgage loan. Authorizes an aggrieved individual to bring a civil action for damages and equitable relief for any violation of this Act. Declares this Act inapplicable to certain residential mortgages entered into before its enactment whose mortgage agreements explicitly provide a procedure or terms for a short sale approval.</summary>
