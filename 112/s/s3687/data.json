(Sec. 2) Designates: (1) the EPA headquarters located at 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., Washington, DC, known as the Ariel Rios Building, as the \"William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building,\" (2) the federal building and U.S. courthouse located at 200 East Wall Street in Midland, Texas, known as the George Mahon Federal Building, as the \"George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush United States Courthouse and George Mahon Federal Building,\" and (3) the federal building currently known as Federal Office Building 8, located at 200 C Street SW, Washington, DC, as the \"Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Federal Building.\" (Sec. 5) Makes the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 and provisions of the federal criminal code prohibiting importation of injurious animals inapplicable to any water transfer by the North Texas Municipal Water District and the Greater Texoma Utility Authority using only closed conveyance systems from the Lake Texoma raw water intake structure to treatment facilities at which all zebra mussels are extirpated and removed from the transferred water. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey the McKinney Lake National Fish Hatchery in Richmond County, North Carolina, to the state of North Carolina to be used by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission as a component of the fish and wildlife management program of the state. Requires the state to allow the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to use such property for the propagation of any critically important aquatic resource held in public trust to address the specific restoration or recovery needs of such resource. Requires reversion of the property if it is used for any purpose other than as described above."
