Requires schools to use that review in developing and implementing policies and procedures that create a school environment and classroom practices that: (1) help each child reach state and grade level expectations, including state academic content and achievement standards; and (2) support successful transitions for children. Requires the review to assess a school's needs for: (1) developmentally appropriate curricula, classroom materials, teaching practices, instructional assessments, and accommodations; (2) services and supports for disabled and limited English proficient children; (3) family and community engagement policies and practices; (4) building and maintaining a school climate that supports positive development and learning; (5) school staff leadership and support; and (6) outreach to, and collaboration with, early childhood education and service providers."
