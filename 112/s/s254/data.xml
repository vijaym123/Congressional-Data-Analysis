  <summary>2/1/2011--Introduced.
Justice for Survivors of Sexual Assault Act of 2011 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require government entities, in order to be entitled to justice system improvement grants to combat violent crimes against women under such Act, to: (1) incur the full out-of-pocket cost of forensic medical exams for victims of sexual assault (current law), and (2) coordinate with regional health care providers to notify sexual assault victims of the availability of free exams. Repeals a provision deeming a government entity to have incurred the full out-of-pocket cost of such an exam if it reimburses the victim for the cost of such exam. Amends the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 to revise the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program to: (1) require the annual reports to the Attorney General by state and local governments receiving Program grants to include a specific breakdown of the number of sexual assault cases that are in a backlog for DNA case work and the percentage of grant amounts allocated to reducing the backlog; (2) direct the Attorney General to compile and publish, annually, a list of states and local governments receiving grants that have failed to provide such information, and (3) prohibit the Attorney General from awarding to such a state or local government for the next fiscal year a grant amount greater than 50% of the amount such government would have received otherwise.</summary>
