  <summary>3/8/2012--Introduced.
Exempts natural gas automobiles from the maximum fuel economy increase standards for dual fueled automobiles for model years 1993-2019. Revises the definition of a "dedicated automobile" (i.e., an automobile that operates only on alternative fuel) to prohibit the inclusion of a reserve gasoline tank for incidental or emergency use in the event of alternative fuel depletion from detracting from the dedicated nature of such an automobile.</summary>
