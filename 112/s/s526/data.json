    "text": "Mohave Valley Land Conveyance Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), upon the request of the Arizona Game and Fish Commission within one year of enactment of this Act, to convey, by quitclaim deed, specified federal land in Mohave County, Arizona, to the Commission for use as a public shooting range. Makes such conveyance subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary may require, including appropriate conditions for addressing the impact of the shooting range on cultural resources. Makes the Commission, if it accepts the conveyance of the federal land, responsible for the payment of: (1) consideration to the Secretary for such land in an amount that is consistent with conveyances made to governmental entities for recreational purposes under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, and (2) the administrative costs associated with the conveyance. Requires the land conveyed under this Act to the Commission to be managed as a public shooting range and for recreation and other public purposes. Requires the federal land to revert to the United States, at the Secretary's option, if it ceases being used for the purposes specified above. States that if the Secretary determines that such land should revert and that it is contaminated with hazardous waste, the local governmental entity to which the land was conveyed shall be responsible for the remediation of such contamination."
