Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend through June 30, 2012, the increased 80% tax credit for health insurance costs (including advance payments) for trade adjustment assistance (TAA) and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) pension recipients. Makes TAA recipients who are in a break in training under a training program, or who are receiving unemployment compensation, eligible for such tax credit for the period through June 30, 2012. Amends the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to extend through June 30, 2012, the TAA pre-certification period rule disregarding any 63-day lapse in creditable health care coverage for TAA workers. Extends the continued eligibility for the credit for qualifying family members and certain qualified TAA-eligible individuals and PBGC pension recipients for COBRA premium assistance through June 30, 2012. Extends through June 30, 2012, coverage under an employee benefit plan funded by a voluntary employees' beneficiary association established pursuant to an order of a bankruptcy court, or by agreement with an authorized representative. Expands for the two-year period beginning after the enactment of this Act the continuous tax levy on payments to vendors for goods and services leased to the federal government to include payments for all property sold or leased to the federal government.</summary>
