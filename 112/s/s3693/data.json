    "text": "School Safety Enhancements Act of 2012 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize school security grants by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services to be used for the installation of surveillance equipment and the establishment of hotlines or tiplines for the reporting of potentially dangerous students and situations. Increases the maximum federal share of the costs of a program provided by a grant to 80%. Requires a grant application to be accompanied by a report that: (1) is signed by the heads of each law enforcement agency and school district with jurisdiction over the schools where the safety improvements will be implemented; and (2) demonstrates that each proposed use of the grant funds will be an effective means for improving school safety, as well as consistent with a comprehensive approach to preventing school violence and individualized to the needs of each school. Requires the Office Director and the Secretary of Education to establish an interagency task force to develop and promulgate a set of advisory school safety guidelines. Authorizes appropriations for such grant program for FY2013-FY2015."
