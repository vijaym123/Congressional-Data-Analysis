Requires such campaign to include dissemination of the following information: (1) breast reconstruction is possible at the time of breast cancer surgery or in a delayed fashion; (2) prostheses or breast forms may be available; (3) federal law mandates that both public and private health plans include coverage of breast reconstruction and prostheses; (4) the patient has a right to choose the provider of reconstructive care, including the potential transfer of care to a surgeon that provides breast reconstructive care; and (5) the patient may opt to undergo breast reconstruction in a delayed fashion for personal reasons or after completion of all other breast cancer treatments. Prohibits such campaign from specifying, or being designed to serve as a tool to limit, the health care providers available to patients."
