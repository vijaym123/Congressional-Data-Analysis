    "text": "Oil Independence for a Stronger America Act of 2011 - Establishes in the Executive Office of the President a national energy security program to reduce oil consumption, by calendar 2030, by a quantity equal to or exceeding the quantity of oil imported from outside North America. Directs the President to develop a national oil independence plan to meet or exceed such goal. Establishes a National Energy Security Council to advise the President in meeting such goal. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate joint regulations establishing fuel efficiency standards and greenhouse gas emissions limitations for certain automobiles and nonroad vehicles. Establishes within the Department of Energy (DOE) a national plug-in electric drive vehicle deployment program and a targeted electric drive vehicle deployment communities program. Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) develop a national plan for plug-in electric drive vehicle deployment, and (2) establish a grants program to assist state and local governmental entities to prepare a community deployment plan. Directs the Administrator of General Services (GSA) to acquire plug-in electric drive vehicles and related charging infrastructure for federal fleets. Establishes a plug-in electric drive vehicle private fleet upgrade program. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to fund research, development, and demonstration projects in advanced batteries, plug-in electric drive vehicle components, and charging infrastructure, as well as in secondary use applications. Provides funds for Advanced Research Projects Agency--Energy (ARPA-E) Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle Research and Development Programs. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish the Advanced Batteries for Tomorrow Prize for a 500-mile vehicle battery. Creates in the Treasury a 500-mile Battery Fund. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to study the supply of raw materials needed for the manufacture of plug-in electric drive vehicles, batteries, and supporting infrastructure. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for the Academy to identify the data that may be collected from plug-in electric drive vehicles. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to require each electric utility to develop a plan for plug-in electric drive vehicles. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to direct the Secretary of Energy to guarantee loans for eligible entities to purchase qualified automotive batteries and for charging infrastructure. Establishes the Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Technical Advisory Committee. Directs the President to establish a Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Interagency Task Force. Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the EPA Administrator to promulgate regulations to establish: (1) national transportation-related goals for reducing oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) standardized models and methods for states, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and air quality agencies to address oil savings and emission reduction goals. Requires MPOs and states to develop surface transportation-related oil savings and greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, including strategies to meet those targets. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to distribute funds to states and MPOs for investing in transportation greenhouse gas emission reduction programs. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase to $230, with a cost-of-living adjustment, the amount of qualified transportation and parking fringe (commuter) benefits excluded from an employee's gross income. Declares it is the goal of the United States to shift at least 10% of freight shipped by truck to rail or marine shipping by 2020. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop a national freight transportation options plan; and (2) make grants to states for the capital costs of facilities, infrastructure, and equipment for high priority rail corridor projects to reduce congestion in freight rail transportation. Requires the Comptroller General to study and reported to specified congressional committees on the benefits and costs of electrification of rail corridors. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an investment tax credit for advanced biofuel facilities as well as grants in lieu of credits for advanced biofuel facility property. Includes algae-based biofuel in the definition of cellulosic biofuel. Extends: (1) the cellulosic biofuel producer credit, (2) the special allowance for cellulosic biofuel plant property, (3) certain credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel, and (4) alcohol fuels tax credits. Allows a tax credit for qualified natural gas motor vehicles, and creates tax-exempt natural gas vehicle bonds. Allows an expensing deduction for manufacturing facilities producing vehicles fueled by compressed or liquefied natural gas. Directs the GSA Administrator to studymeans of increasing the number of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas vehicles in the federal fleet. Establishes in DOE the Energy Efficiency Improvement for Heating Oil, Propane, and Kerosene Program to fund state participation in programs operated by a national oilheat research alliance or the Propane Education and Research Council to implement cost-effective energy efficiency programs for homes and buildings that use home heating oil, propane, and kerosene. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a renewable biomass thermal energy loan program of grants to states to support financial assistance by qualified program delivery entities to replace with certain wood or wood-pellet fired boilers any thermal energy systems in commercial or multifamily residential buildings that use heating oil or another petroleum product."
