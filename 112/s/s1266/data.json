Requires the Director to develop criteria to ensure that funded activities: (1) restore or protect fish and wildlife and their habitats; (2) improve or protect water quality by reducing pollutants and restoring headwater areas and drinking water basins; (3) improve management of water volume and mitigation of flood damage to support the ecological needs of fish and wildlife and the habitats of fish and wildlife; (4) include priority needs or actions identified in the basin-wide strategy; and/or (5) include restoration and protection activities with multiple benefits in the Basin, including habitat, water quality, and flood damage mitigation. Limits the federal share of the total cost of a funded project to 50%. Authorizes the Director to contract to manage the grant program with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation or a similar organization that offers grant management services."
