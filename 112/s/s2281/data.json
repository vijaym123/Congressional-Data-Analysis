Requires the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to seek the opinion of external experts on topics that may include: (1) rare diseases; (2) the severity of rare diseases; (3) the unmet medical need associated with rare diseases; (4) the willingness and ability of individuals with a rare disease to participate in clinical trials; (5) an assessment of the benefits and risks, including side effects, of current and investigational therapies; (6) the design of clinical trials for rare disease populations and subpopulations; and (7) demographics and the clinical description of patient populations. Authorizes: (1) external experts to request the opportunity to meet with a review division regarding any such topic, and (2) external experts who are consulted to be considered special government employees. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) create a right for any external expert to obtain access to proprietary information of a sponsor without that sponsor's permission or a legal right for a consultation on any matter, or (2) require the Secretary to meet with any particular expert."
