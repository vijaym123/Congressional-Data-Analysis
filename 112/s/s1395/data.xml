WAIVE Act - Allows an individual to apply for a waiver from one or more of the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) by submitting an application to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Requires the application to include: (1) the provision or provisions of PPACA for which the waiver is being sought; and (2) a brief description of why compliance would result in a decrease in access to benefits that are currently covered by a plan or policy in which the individual is enrolled or an increase in premiums to be paid by the individual for such coverage. Requires the Secretary to: (1) issue waivers within 30 days of the receipt of such application, and (2) issue guidance to individuals in how they can apply for and be granted a waiver under this Act.</summary>
