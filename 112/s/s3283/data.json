Excludes from the exemption from fair housing requirements for a religious organization or private club any religion whose membership is restricted to persons who are not servicemembers or veterans. Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1968 to impose a fine, imprisonment, or both on persons who violate housing discrimination prohibitions under such Act against servicemembers and veterans."
