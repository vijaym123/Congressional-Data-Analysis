Requires the the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a Registry of Legitimate Online Pharmacy Websites for the purpose of educating consumers and promoting public health and safety. Allows only those pharmacies designated as legitimate by the Secretary on the site. Sets forth criteria for determining the legitimacy of a pharmacy. Requires the Secretary to: (1) engage in a campaign to educate consumers on the availability and use of the Registry to promote public health and safety; and (2) make consumer education materials available, on the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) website, regarding how to safely purchase drugs over the Internet."
