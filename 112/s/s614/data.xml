Securing Terrorist Intelligence Act - Prohibits the Attorney General (AG) or any officer or employee of the Department of Justice (DOJ) from initiating a custodial interrogation of, or filing a criminal complaint or indictment (action) against any foreign person detained by the United States because they may have engaged in conduct constituting an act of war against the United States, terrorism, or material support to terrorists or activities in preparation therefor, unless the AG has previously consulted with: (1) the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), (2) the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, (3) the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), and (4) the Secretary of Defense (DOD). Provides that if any of the intelligence officials believe that any action proposed by the AG may prevent the collection of intelligence related to terrorism or threats of violence against the United States or its citizens, the AG may not initiate such action without specific direction from the President. Requires an annual report from the AG to Congress on the occasions on which direction for action was sought from the President and the number of times the President directed such actions.</summary>
