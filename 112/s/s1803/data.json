Exempts nuisance dust from the CAA and excludes nuisance dust from\u00a0references in such Act to particulate matter, except with\u00a0respect to geographical areas where such dust is not regulated under state, tribal, or local law\u00a0if the Administrator finds that: (1) nuisance dust (or any subcategory of nuisance dust) causes substantial adverse public health and welfare effects at ambient concentrations; and (2) the benefits of applying CAA standards and other requirements to such dust outweigh the costs. Defines \"nuisance dust\" as particulate matter: (1) generated from natural sources, unpaved roads, agricultural activities, earth moving, or other activities typically conducted in rural areas; or (2) consisting primarily of soil, other natural or biological materials, windblown dust, or some combination thereof."
