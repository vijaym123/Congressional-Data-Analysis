Directs the Secretary to implement an identity theft tax fraud prevention program that provides for a unique personal identification number (PIN) on tax returns. Authorizes the Commissioner to transfer appropriated funds to be used solely to prevent and resolve potential tax fraud cases.

Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from disclosing information contained on the Death Master File relating to a deceased individual to persons who are not certified to access such information. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1)\u00a0establish and implement procedures to eliminate the unnecessary collection, use, and display of Social Security account numbers of Medicare beneficiaries; (2) ensure that newly-issued Medicare identification cards meet certain security standards;\u00a0and (3) establish a pilot program to evaluate the applicability of smart card technology to Medicare beneficiaries or providers and whether such cards would be effective in preventing Medicare fraud."
