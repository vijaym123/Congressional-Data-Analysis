  <summary>4/12/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) Medicare should not be dismantled and turned into a voucher or premium-support program; (2) deficit reduction should not be achieved by simply passing on the costs of health care to Medicare beneficiaries; (3) guaranteed Medicare benefits should be preserved; (4) medical decisions should be made by seniors and their doctors, not insurance companies; and (5) deficit reduction should be achieved by lowering health care costs through delivery system reforms.</summary>
