Critical Minerals and Materials Promotion Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the United States Geological Survey (USGS), to establish a research and development program to: (1) provide data and scientific analyses for research on, and assessments of the potential for, undiscovered and discovered resources of critical minerals and materials in the United States and other countries; (2) analyze and assess current and future critical minerals and materials supply chains; and (3) cooperate with international partners to ensure that the research and assessment programs provide analyses of the global supply chain of critical minerals and materials. Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to conduct a research, development, and demonstration program to strengthen the domestic critical minerals and materials supply chain for clean energy technologies, and to ensure the long-term, secure, and sustainable supply of critical minerals and materials sufficient to strengthen the national security and meet the clean energy production needs of the United States. Directs the Secretary of Energy to promote the development of the critical minerals and materials industry workforce in the United States by supporting: (1) critical minerals and materials education by providing undergraduate and graduate scholarships and fellowships at institutions of higher education, including technical and community colleges; (2) partnerships between industry and institutions of higher education, including technical and community colleges, to provide onsite job training; and (3) development of courses and curricula on critical minerals and materials. Expresses the policy of the United States to promote an adequate and stable supply of critical minerals and materials necessary to maintain national security, economic well-being, and industrial production with appropriate attention to a long-term balance between resource production, energy use, a healthy environment, natural resources conservation, and social needs. Directs the President take specified steps to implement such policy.</summary>
