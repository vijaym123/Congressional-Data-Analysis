Permits a grant recipient to request permission to transfer such 10-year obligation to another facility.Authorizes a state that receives a grant to award a subgrant to a qualified community program for activities such as: (1) the construction, expansion, and modernization of mental health and substance abuse facilities; (2) the construction and structural modification of facilities to permit the integrated delivery of behavioral health and primary care of specialty medical services to individuals with co-occurring mental illnesses and chronic medical or surgical diseases at a single service site; and (3) acquiring information technology required to accommodate the clinical needs of primary and specialty care professionals.
