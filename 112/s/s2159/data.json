Requires the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in carrying out such Program, to ensure that: (1) each recipient of an initial or renewal grant meets the grant eligibility criteria for each fiscal year, and (2) the meeting of that criteria is fully documented. Requires the Director, upon delegating authority to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to carry out Program activities, to: (1) develop and document an approach to monitoring and overseeing the administration of the Program by SAMHSA, and (2) fully define the respective roles and responsibilities of the Office and SAMHSA in administering the Program. Authorizes the Director to make a grant to an eligible organization to provide for the establishment of a National Community Anti-Drug Coalition Institute to: (1) provide education, training, and technical assistance for coalition leaders and community teams, with emphasis on the development of coalitions serving economically disadvantaged areas; (2) develop and disseminate evaluation tools, mechanisms, and measures to better assess and document coalition performance measures and outcomes; and (3) bridge the gap between research and practice by translating knowledge from research into practical information."
