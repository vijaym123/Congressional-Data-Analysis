Requires the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to award grants for: (1) an analysis of the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) file to develop preliminary estimates on the totals costs to Medicare for items, services, and treatments for HHT; and (2) recommendations regarding an enhanced data collection protocol to permit a more precise determination of such costs.</summary>
