Requires the Strategy to include: (1) provisions for increasing the preparedness, response capabilities, and surge capacity of dental health facilities and critical care service systems; (2) plans for optimizing a coordinated and flexible approach to the medical surge capacity of hospitals, other health care facilities, and trauma care and emergency medical systems; (3) provisions taking into account the unique needs of individuals with disabilities in a public health emergency; and (4) strategic initiatives to advance countermeasures to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or treat harm from any biological agent or toxin or any chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents, whether naturally occurring, unintentional, or deliberate. Requires the Secretary to: (1) monitor emerging issues and concerns as they relate to medical and public health preparedness and response for at-risk individuals in the event of a public health emergency; (2) disseminate and update novel and best practices of outreach to and care of at-risk individuals before, during, and following public health emergencies in as timely a manner as is practicable, including from the time a public health threat is identified; and (3) ensure that public health and medical information distributed by HHS during a public health emergency is delivered in a manner that takes into account the range of communication needs of the intended recipients, including at-risk individuals. (Sec. 102) Requires the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to provide integrated policy coordination and strategic direction with respect to all matters related to federal public health and medical preparedness and execution and deployment of the federal response for public health emergencies and incidents covered by the National Response Plan before, during, and following public health emergencies. Give the Assistant Secretary direct authority over and responsibility for: (1) the Medical Reserve Corps, (2) the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals, and (3) administering grants and related authorities related to trauma care. Authorizes the Assistant Secretary to exercise the responsibilities and authorities of the Secretary with respect to the coordination of the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement Program. Requires the Assistant Secretary to: (1) align and coordinate medical and public health grants and cooperative agreements as applicable to preparedness and response activities authorized under PHSA; and (2) carry out drills and operational exercises to identify, inform, and address gaps in and policies related to all-hazards medical and public health preparedness. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary, to: (1) conduct periodic meetings with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to provide an update on, and to discuss, medical and public health preparedness and response activities; (2) develop a coordinated strategy and accompanying implementation plan for medical countermeasures to address chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. Requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct an independent evaluation on the strategy and implementation plan. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop and annually update a five-year budget plan based on medical countermeasures and priorities; (2) report to the relevant congressional committees regarding coordination with the Department of Defense (DOD) regarding countermeasure activities to address chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats; and (3) ensure that information and items that could compromise national security are not disclosed.

Authorizes the Secretary to determine and pay claims for reimbursement for services provided through the System directly or through contracts that provide for payment in advance or by way of reimbursement. (Sec. 105) Reauthorizes through FY2016 a program for public health emergency readiness of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. Title II: Optimizing State and Local All-Hazards Preparedness and Response - (Sec. 201) Revises and reauthorizes for FY2012-FY2016 a program of cooperative agreements to improve state and local public health security. Revises requirements for the All-Hazards Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan. Requires the Secretary to: (1) periodically update criteria for an effective state plan for responding to pandemic influenza, and (2) require the integration of such criteria into the benchmarks and standards that measure levels of preparedness. Provides that amounts provided to an eligible entity under a cooperative agreement to achieve preparedness goals for a fiscal year that are unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to such entity for the next fiscal year. Makes continued availability of such funds contingent upon achieving benchmarks and submitting a pandemic influenza plan. Eliminates provisions limiting the amount of an award that an entity may carry over to the succeeding fiscal year. Reauthorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2016 for the influenza vaccine tracking and distribution program in an influenza pandemic.

Makes community health centers eligible for such a program. Provides that amounts provided to an eligible entity under such program for a fiscal year that are unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to such entity for the next fiscal year for the purposes for which such funds were provided. Makes continued availability of such funds contingent upon achieving benchmarks and submitting a pandemic influenza plan. (Sec. 203) Reauthorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2016 for a program to improve public health alert communications and surveillance and public health situational awareness capability. Includes poison control centers in the integrated system of public health alert communications and surveillance networks. Requires the Secretary to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a coordinated strategy and an accompanying implementation plan that identifies and demonstrates the measurable steps the Secretary will carry out to: (1) develop, implement, and evaluate the public health situation awareness systems; and (2) modernize and enhance biosurveillance activities. Requires the network to include data from community health centers and health centers. Requires the National Biodefense Science Board to provide expert advice and guidance regarding the measurable steps the Secretary should take to modernize and enhance biosurveillance activities pursuant to the efforts of HHS to ensure comprehensive, real-time all-hazards biosurveillance capabilities. Title III: Enhancing Medical Countermeasure Review - (Sec. 301) Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to revise provisions governing special protocol assessments to include agreements on the design and size of animal and any associated clinical trials which, in combination, are intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim for a countermeasure or epidemic or pandemic product when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. (Sec. 302) Revises provisions permitting the Secretary to authorize the use of unapproved medical products or the unapproved use of an approved product, including to: (1) allow the Secretary to base the determination on a threat (rather than a specific threat as under current law); (2) allow the Secretary to base the determination on a significant potential for a public health emergency; (3) allow the Secretary to base the determination on the identification of a material threat sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens abroad; (4) eliminate the one-year expiration date; and (5) allow a person to revise the label to reflect the new expiration date.

Authorizes the Secretary to permit deviations from good manufacturing practice requirements when the circumstances of a domestic, military, or public health emergency or material threat so warrant. Authorizes the Secretary to waive requirements for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for domestic, military, and public health emergencies (currently, such waiver authority applies only to public health emergencies) and for the identification of a material threat sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens abroad. Permits a government entity to introduce into interstate commerce a product intended for emergency use if that product is intended to be held and not used, and is held and not used, unless and until it is: (1) approved, cleared, or licensed; (2) authorized for investigational use; or (3) authorized for emergency use.
