Requires the Secretary to: (1) monitor emerging issues and concerns as they relate to medical and public health preparedness and response for at-risk individuals in the event of a public health emergency; (2) disseminate and update novel and best practices of outreach to and care of at-risk individuals before, during, and following public health emergencies in as timely a manner as is practicable, including from the time a public health threat is identified; and (3) ensure that public health and medical information distributed by HHS during a public health emergency is delivered in a manner that takes into account the range of communication needs of the intended recipients, including at-risk individuals. (Sec. 102) Requires the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to provide integrated policy coordination and strategic direction with respect to all matters related to federal public health and medical preparedness and execution and deployment of the federal response for public health emergencies and incidents covered by the National Response Plan before, during, and following public health emergencies.

Title II: Optimizing State and Local All-Hazards Preparedness and Response - (Sec. 201) Revises and reauthorizes for FY2012-FY2016 a program of cooperative agreements to improve state and local public health security. Revises requirements for the All-Hazards Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan. Requires the Secretary to: (1) periodically update criteria for an effective state plan for responding to pandemic influenza, and (2) require the integration of such criteria into the benchmarks and standards that measure levels of preparedness. Provides that amounts provided to an eligible entity under a cooperative agreement to achieve preparedness goals for a fiscal year that are unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to such entity for the next fiscal year. Makes continued availability of such funds contingent upon achieving benchmarks and submitting a pandemic influenza plan. Eliminates provisions limiting the amount of an award that an entity may carry over to the succeeding fiscal year. Reauthorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2016 for the influenza vaccine tracking and distribution program in an influenza pandemic.

Provides that amounts provided to an eligible entity under such program for a fiscal year that are unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to such entity for the next fiscal year for the purposes for which such funds were provided. Makes continued availability of such funds contingent upon achieving benchmarks and submitting a pandemic influenza plan. (Sec. 203) Reauthorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2016 for a program to improve public health alert communications and surveillance and public health situational awareness capability. Includes poison control centers in the integrated system of public health alert communications and surveillance networks. Requires the Secretary to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a coordinated strategy and an accompanying implementation plan that identifies and demonstrates the measurable steps the Secretary will carry out to: (1) develop, implement, and evaluate the public health situation awareness systems; and (2) modernize and enhance biosurveillance activities. Requires the network to include data from community health centers and health centers. Requires the National Biodefense Science Board to provide expert advice and guidance regarding the measurable steps the Secretary should take to modernize and enhance biosurveillance activities pursuant to the efforts of HHS to ensure comprehensive, real-time all-hazards biosurveillance capabilities. Title III: Enhancing Medical Countermeasure Review - (Sec. 301) Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to revise provisions governing special protocol assessments to include agreements on the design and size of animal and any associated clinical trials which, in combination, are intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim for a countermeasure or epidemic or pandemic product when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. (Sec. 302) Revises provisions permitting the Secretary to authorize the use of unapproved medical products or the unapproved use of an approved product, including to: (1) allow the Secretary to base the determination on a threat (rather than a specific threat as under current law); (2) allow the Secretary to base the determination on a significant potential for a public health emergency; (3) allow the Secretary to base the determination on the identification of a material threat sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens abroad; (4) eliminate the one-year expiration date; and (5) allow a person to revise the label to reflect the new expiration date. Authorizes the Secretary to extend the expiration date of eligible medical countermeasures if the Secretary determines: (1) that the extension will help protect public health; (2) the extension is supported by scientific evaluation that is conducted or accepted by the Secretary; (3) what changes to the product labeling, if any, are required or permitted; and (4) that any other conditions that the Secretary deems appropriate have been met. Authorizes the Secretary to permit deviations from good manufacturing practice requirements when the circumstances of a domestic, military, or public health emergency or material threat so warrant. Authorizes the Secretary to waive requirements for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for domestic, military, and public health emergencies (currently, such waiver authority applies only to public health emergencies) and for the identification of a material threat sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens abroad. Permits a government entity to introduce into interstate commerce a product intended for emergency use if that product is intended to be held and not used, and is held and not used, unless and until it is: (1) approved, cleared, or licensed; (2) authorized for investigational use; or (3) authorized for emergency use. Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure the appropriate involvement of FDA personnel in interagency activities related to countermeasure advanced research and development, (2) ensure the appropriate involvement and consultation of FDA personnel in flexible manufacturing activities, (3) promote countermeasure expertise within the FDA, and (4) maintain teams composed of FDA personnel with expertise on countermeasures. Requires the Secretary to establish a procedure by which a sponsor or applicant that is developing a countermeasure for which human efficacy studies are not ethical or practicable, and that has an approved investigational new drug application or investigation device exemption, may request and receive: (1) a meeting to discuss proposed animal model development activities, and (2) a meeting prior to initiating pivotal animal studies. Requires such meetings to include discussion of animal models for pediatric populations, as appropriate. Requires the Secretary to take into account the material threat posed by the chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent for which the countermeasure under review is intended when evaluating a countermeasure for approval, licensure, or clearance. Directs that, when practicable and appropriate, teams of FDA personnel reviewing applications or submissions shall include a reviewer with sufficient training or experience with countermeasures pursuant to established protocols. Requires the Secretary to establish a formal process for obtaining scientific feedback and interactions regarding the development and regulatory review of eligible countermeasures by facilitating the development of written regulatory management plans. Allows prioritization of countermeasures to receive regulatory management plans if the Commissioner of Food and Drugs determines that resources are not available to establish regulatory management plans for all eligible countermeasures. Directs the Secretary to submit to the specified congressional committees a report detailing the countermeasure development and review activities of the FDA.
