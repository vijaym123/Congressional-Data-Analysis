Supports a diplomatic process by all claimants for resolving outstanding territorial and jurisdictional disputes. Supports U.S. Armed Forces operations in the Western Pacific, including in the South China Sea, in support of freedom of navigation, the maintenance of peace, respect for international law, and unimpeded lawful commerce.</summary>
