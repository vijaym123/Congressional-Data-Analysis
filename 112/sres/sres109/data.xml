  <summary>4/14/2011--Passed Senate amended.
Honors the women in North Africa and the Middle East who have worked to ensure that women are guaranteed equality and basic human rights. Recognizes that women's empowerment is inextricably linked to the potential of nations to generate economic growth and democracy. Reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the universal rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of association, including via the Internet. Celebrates this year's centennial anniversary of International Women's Day. Condemns efforts to provoke violence against women. Underscores the importance of women's rights and political participation as leaders in North Africa and the Middle East consider constitutional reforms and shape new governments.</summary>
