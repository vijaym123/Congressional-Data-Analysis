  <summary>2/10/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) while the United States continues to combat terrorism in all forms around the world the safety, security, and health of our livestock and agriculture commodities must not be forgotten; (2) research and investment in biosecurity and biosafety should remain a congressional priority; (3) providing the resources for the advancement of vaccines and eradication of deadly pathogens and emerging zoonotic disease is an integral part of homeland defense; (4) a laboratory capable of handling such deadly diseases is necessary to meet the demand for such resources; and (5) the United States must remain the leader in the fight against bioterrorism.</summary>
