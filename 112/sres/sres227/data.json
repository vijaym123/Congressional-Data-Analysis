Encourages greater U.S. engagement with the Mekong River countries through the Lower Mekong Initiative. Applauds the government of Laos' decision to temporarily suspend work on the Xayaburi Dam. Supports delay of the construction of mainstream hydropower dams along the Mekong River until environmental assessments have been completed. Calls on: (1) riparian states along the Mekong River, including China, to respect the rights of other River basin countries; and (2) the governments of Burma and China to improve cooperation with the Mekong River Commission. Supports assistance to the Lower Mekong River riparian states to analyze the impacts of proposed development."
