Recognizes the right of the Syrian people to defend themselves against the violence being conducted by the Assad regime and supports calls by Arab leaders to provide the Syrian people with the means to defend themselves. Urges the President to take all necessary precautions to ensure that support for the Syrian opposition does not benefit individuals in Syria who are aligned with al Qaeda or who have committed human rights abuses. Affirms that the establishment of safe havens would be an important step to save Syrian lives and calls on the President to consult with regional allies on whether, how, and where to create such safe havens. Urges the President, as part of an international effort to hold senior Syrian officials accountable for mass atrocities, to gather information about such mass atrocities. Commends the establishment of the Friends of the Syrian People Contact Group and other international diplomatic efforts to end the violence and support a peaceful transition to democracy and the removal of Bashar al-Assad from power."
