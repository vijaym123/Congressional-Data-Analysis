  <summary>5/18/2011--Passed Senate without amendment.
Urges the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) reject any efforts by the European Union to modify existing passenger name record (PNR) data sharing mechanisms in a way that would degrade the usefulness of the PNR data for identifying terrorists and other dangerous criminals, and (2) not enter into any agreement that would impose European oversight structures on the United States. Opposes any effort by the European Union to interfere with counterterrorism cooperation and information sharing between DHS and non-European countries.</summary>
