  <summary>4/14/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) U.S. military intervention in Libya, as explained by the President, is not in the vital interests of the United States; (2) the President should have consulted with Congress prior to committing the U.S. Armed Forces either independently or as a major part of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operations; (3) the President should obtain authorization from Congress before providing further military and financial support to Libya operations and should not assume that such an authorization would equate to the U.S. Armed Forces leading any future strike or support operations; (4) prior to further U.S. military involvement NATO members and other nations with a vital regional interest should agree to provide a substantial portion of the military and financial burdens associated with Operation Unified Protector; and (5) members of the Arab League should ensure that all of their military resources are available to enforce U.N. Resolutions 1970 and 1973.</summary>
