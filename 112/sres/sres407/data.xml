Expresses the sense of the Senate that, until the segregated account funds of its customers have been fully repaid in full, and federal investigations have revealed both the cause of, and parties responsible for, the loss of millions of dollars of its customer money, bonuses should not be paid to the executives and employees responsible for the day-to-day management and operations of MF Global.</summary>
