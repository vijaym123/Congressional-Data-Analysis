Expresses appreciation for the efforts of the European countries that have implemented legislation for the restitution of, or compensation for, private, communal, and religious property confiscated during the Nazi or Communist eras and welcomes the efforts of the governments of many post-Communist countries to address the status of such property. Urges each government that has not already done so to implement legislation to effect the in rem return of, or the payment of, compensation for such confiscated property. Calls on each government to establish restitution and compensation schemes in a simple, transparent, and timely manner to provide a real benefit to those who suffered from the unjust confiscation of their property. Calls on the Secretary of State to issue an updated report on property restitution in Central and Eastern Europe."
