Urges the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) streamline the review and approval of applications for both shallow and deepwater drilling permits in the Outer Continental Shelf, (2) take immediate action to provide the shallow and deepwater industry with a completed sample application meeting all new safety and environmental regulations, (3) supply written guidance and clarification to applicants regarding new safety requirements, and (4) give permit applicants timely and detailed explanations on any areas of a permit which do not satisfy new requirements."
