  <summary>7/31/2012--Passed Senate amended.
Honors the life, bravery, and leadership of Oswaldo Paya Sardinas, and offers condolences to his family, friends, and loved ones. Calls on the United States to continue policies that promote religious freedom, democracy, and human rights in Cuba. Calls on the government of Cuba to: (1) allow an impartial, third-party investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Oswaldo Paya Sardinas; and (2) provide its citizens with internationally accepted standards for civil and human rights and the opportunity to vote in free and fair elections. Condemns the government of Cuba for the detention of nearly 50 pro-democracy activists following the memorial service for Oswaldo Paya Sardinas.</summary>
