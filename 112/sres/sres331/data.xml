  <summary>11/16/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should pass a deficit reduction measure that: (1) includes enough deficit reduction to stabilize the federal debt as a share of the economy, put the debt on a downward path, and provide fiscal certainty; (2) reduces the deficit by at least $4 trillion over 10 years in order to reassure financial markets; (3) uses established, bipartisan debt and deficit reduction frameworks as a starting point for discussions; (4) focuses on the major parts of the budget and includes long-term entitlement reforms and pro-growth tax reform; (5) is structured to grow the economy in the short, medium, and long terms to create jobs in the United States; and (6) includes tax reform that guarantees deficit reduction and economic growth to rebuild America.</summary>
