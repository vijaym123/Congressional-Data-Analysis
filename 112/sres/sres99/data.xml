    <title as="introduced" type="official">A resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the primary safeguard for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and that the primary safeguards for the legal rights of children in the United States are the Constitutions of the United States and the several States, and that, because the use of international treaties to govern policy in the United States on families and children is contrary to principles of self-government and federalism, and that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child undermines traditional principles of law in the United States regarding parents and children, the President should not transmit the Convention to the Senate for its advice and consent.</title>

  <summary>3/10/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is incompatible with the Constitution, the laws, and the traditions of the United States; (2) the Convention would undermine presumptions of freedom and independence for U.S. families; (3) the Convention would interfere with U.S. principles of sovereignty, independence, and self-government that preclude the necessity or propriety of adopting international law to govern domestic matters; and (4) the President should not transmit the Convention to the Senate for its advice and consent.</summary>
