Expresses the support of the House of Representatives for states that have successfully implemented school breakfast programs in order to improve the test scores and grades of their participating students. Encourages states to: (1) strengthen their school breakfast programs by improving student access, (2) promote improvements in the nutritional quality of breakfasts served, and (3) inform students and parents of healthy nutritional and lifestyle choices. Recognizes: (1) that the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 provides low-income children with greater access to nutritious breakfasts; (2) the role nonprofit and community organizations play in increasing awareness of, and access to, breakfast programs for low-income children; and (3) that National School Breakfast Week helps draw attention to the need for, and success of, the school breakfast program."
