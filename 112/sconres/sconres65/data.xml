  <summary>12/19/2012--Introduced.
Congratulates the Navy and the many crews of the U.S.S. Enterprise (CVN 65) (Enterprise) on having provided the United States an incalculable service in international relations and engagement and in the prevention and winning of armed conflicts over the 51-year period of its service. Honors the service and memory of: (1) the 121 sailors who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country while serving onboard the Enterprise, including the 30 that were killed in action during the Vietnam War; and (2) the 20 Enterprise sailors who were held as prisoners of war during the Vietnam War, the 3 who died while in captivity, and the 5 still listed as missing-in-action. Congratulates the nearly 100,000 current and former sailors who have served on the Enterprise and thanks them for their selfless sacrifice in service to the United States.</summary>
