Lists recommended budgetary levels and amounts for FY2013-FY2022 with respect to: (1) federal revenues, (2) new budget authority, (3) budget outlays, (4) deficits, (5) public debt, and (6) debt held by the public. Lists the appropriate levels of new budget authority, outlays, and administrative expenses of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund (Social Security Trust Funds) and specified major functional categories for FY2013-FY2022.

Authorizes the Chairman to reduce the allocations of committees for any savings achieved by such sales, repeals, and reduction, with the savings used to reduce the deficit. Makes it out of order to consider in the Senate any legislation that would cause the discretionary spending limits in this resolution to be exceeded, except by a supermajority waiver. Specifies such discretionary spending limits in the Senate for FY2013-FY2022. Makes it out of order to consider in the Senate any legislation that would require advanced appropriations. Sets forth requirements for the treatment of emergency legislation. Allows the Chairman to adjust the estimate of budgetary effects of legislation that: (1) amends or supersedes the system for updating physician payments under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, and (2) amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a single, flat tax rate to conform with the annual revenue levels specified in this resolution. Permits the Chairman to make such adjustments only for points of order in specified legislation relating to: (1) pay-as-you-go, and (2) long- and short-term deficits. Requires Senate committees to: (1) review programs and tax expenditures in their jurisdictions to identify waste, fraud, and abuse or duplication, and to increase the use of performance data to inform committee work; (2) review the matters for congressional consideration identified on the Government Accountability Office's (GAO) High Risk list report; and (3) make recommendations to the Senate Budget Committee to improve governmental performance in their annual views and estimates reports. Sets forth reconciliation instructions for the Senate Committees on: (1) Commerce, Science, and Transportation; (2) Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; (3) Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; and (4) Finance. Declares the policy of Congress on attainment of Social Security solvency, reduction in Medicare unfunded liabilities, Medicaid sustainability at the federal level, tax reform, federal government assets sales and transfers of government activities to the private sector, and repeal of the PPACA. Expresses the sense of Congress on: (1) applying regulatory analysis requirements for executive branch agencies to independent agencies, (2) voting on the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, (3) the automatic biennial sunsetting of all federal regulations unless repromulgated by Congress, (4) implementing regulatory process reform, (5) incorporating formal rulemaking procedures for all major regulations, and (6) requiring any adjustments to allocations and aggregates to require rescission of any unspent or unobligated allocations after 36 months.</summary>
