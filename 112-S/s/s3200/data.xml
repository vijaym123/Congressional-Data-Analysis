  <summary>5/17/2012--Introduced.
Amends the Small Business Export Development Act to direct the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to submit to the congressional small business committees periodic reports, beginning two years after the enactment of this Act, that rank each state and U.S. territory, the District of Columbia, and the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas on how well their regulations and policies create optimal environments for the creation and development of small businesses. Designates each such report as a National Small Business Climate Index (Index). Outlines factors to be used to achieve such rankings. Requires the Chief Counsel, within one year after the enactment of this Act, to report to such committees on the progress in preparing the first Index.</summary>
