  <summary>7/29/2011--Introduced.
Commercial Truck Safety Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to establish a program to improve commercial motor vehicle safety on Interstate System (IS) highways. Directs the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking to establish a demonstration program under which a state governor may request from the Secretary a three-year waiver for covered trucks (six-axle trucks with a maximum gross weight of up to 100,000 pounds) to operate on the state's IS highways. Requires a state, as a condition for receiving a waiver, to: (1) collect data on the waiver's effects, particularly on accident rates involving heavier trucks; and (2) establish a safety committee to review such data.</summary>
