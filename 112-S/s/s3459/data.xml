  <summary>7/31/2012--Introduced.
Department of Energy High-End Computing Improvement Act of 2012 - Renames the Department of Energy High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004 as the Department of Energy High-End Computing Act of 2012. Defines "exascale computing" as computing through the use of a computing machine that performs near or above 10 to the 18th power floating point operations per second. Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to: (1) conduct a research program to develop exascale computing machines to promote DOE missions; (2) coordinate the development of such machines across all applicable DOE agencies; and (3) implement the program through an integration of application, computer science, and computer hardware architecture using public-private partnerships to ensure that exascale computing machines are capable of solving DOE target applications and scientific problems. Authorizes appropriations for FY2013-FY2015.</summary>
