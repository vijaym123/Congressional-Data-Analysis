Considers such Department personnel to be engaged in authorized data sharing activities when lawfully seeking to: (1) verify the identity of a passport applicant, (2) detect passport fraud, or (3) deny or revoke a passport. Directs the Secretary to promulgate implementing regulations regarding data sharing regulations, procedures, and policies. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study, and report to Congress, to determine: (1) if U.S. passport applicants or renewals should provide biometric identification information, and (2) if technology should be employed to verify identity documents."
