Requires a state, to be eligible to receive any form of financial assistance, to include in its plan or application an assurance that the state has in effect a state law for mandatory reporting of child abuse or neglect. Directs the Secretary of HHS to collect information on and otherwise study the efforts of states relating to state laws for mandatory reporting of incidents of child abuse or neglect in order to assess the implementation of CAPTA. Requires an application for a community-based grant to contain an assurance that the state has in effect a state law for mandatory reporting of child abuse or neglect.</summary>
