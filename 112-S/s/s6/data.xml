  <summary>1/25/2011--Introduced.
Reform America's Broken Immigration System Act - Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should: strengthen our commitments to border security; pass legislation, such as the DREAM Act, supporting national and economic security; implement a rational legal immigration system to ensure that the best and brightest can come to the United States and create jobs; require all U.S. workers to have tamper-proof identification to further prevent and penalize illegal hiring; hold accountable people here illegally by requiring them to either earn legal status or be immediately deported; and adopt practical and fair immigration reforms to help ensure that families are able to be together.</summary>
