Amends the federal judicial code to repeal the requirement that the Comptroller General (GAO) review contributions to the Judicial Survivors' Annuities Fund at the end of each three-fiscal year period. Changes reporting and audit requirements of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to require: (1) reports on the strategy of ONDCP's national media campaign on February 1, 2013, and every three years thereafter, rather than annually, and (2) audits of the programs and operations of ONDCP not later than December 31, 2013, and every three years thereafter, rather than annually. Amends the Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010 to modify the annual GAO reporting requirement for the demonstration project for referral of claims under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 to the Office of Special Counsel to require only one annual report after the commencement of the demonstration project. Amends the Semipostal Authorization Act to repeal the requirement that GAO issue an interim report four years after a semipostal stamp is first made available to the public and a final report not later than six months before the semipostal stamp's scheduled expiration date. Amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act to eliminate the annual GAO review requirement for the Earned Import Allowance Program for imports of textiles. Eliminates requirements that the American Battle Monuments Commission prepare an annual financial statement and obtain an annual audit of its financial statement by GAO. Requires audits of the Senate Preservation Fund at least once every three years, rather than annually, unless the Chairman or the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration or the Secretary of the Senate requests that an audit be conducted at an earlier date."
