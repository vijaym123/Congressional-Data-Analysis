Extends the exemption to any employee working broadly in a computer or information technology (IT) occupation, including but not limited to work related to computers, information systems, components, networks, software, hardware, databases, security, the Internet, intranet, or websites. Adds to the current occupations cited designer, developer, and administrator. Applies such exemption to IT professionals: (1) whose primary duties include, among other things, network or database analysis, consulting with users, and directing the work or training of individuals performing such duties; and (2) who are paid at a rate of at least $27.63 an hour (as under current law) or on a salary basis."
