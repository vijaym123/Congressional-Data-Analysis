  <summary>5/26/2011--Introduced.
Shawnee Cattle Trail Study Act - Amends the National Trails System Act to require the study of the Shawnee Cattle Trail, consisting of three main branches and several smaller connecting trails extending from Texas to Missouri, and later Kansas, which is considered the oldest of the major Texas Cattle Trails, for potential addition to the National Trails System. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from considering specified alternatives related to private property protections. Requires the study to include an analysis and documentation regarding whether each alternative proposed has potential or actual impact on private property within or adjacent to the trail area. Requires all private property owners whose land will be studied to be notified that such study will be conducted.</summary>
