Requires the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to: (1) prepare a management plan for the Preserve; (2) establish a new science and education program for the Preserve; (3) undertake activities for improving the health of forest, grassland, and riparian areas within the Preserve; and (4) study the feasibility of establishing a hiking trail along the rim of the Valles Caldera. Authorizes the establishment of a science and education center outside of the Preserve. Transfers administrative jurisdiction over the Preserve from the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) and the Valles Caldera Trust to the Secretary. Modifies the boundaries of Santa Fe National Forest to exclude the Preserve. Terminates the Valles Caldera Trust."
