  <summary>4/7/2011--Introduced.
Soledad Canyon High Desert, California Public Lands Conservation and Management Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to cancel Bureau of Land Management (BLM) mineral contracts CA-20139 and CA-22901 and withdraw the areas that were subject to such contracts from further mineral entry under all mineral leasing and sales authorities available to the Secretary. Requires the holder of such contracts to receive specified compensation for the cancellation. Deems: (1) any negotiated agreement between the Secretary and the contract holder as to the amount of compensation to be a compromise settlement of imminent litigation, and (2) judgment by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to be final. Directs the Secretary to offer for sale by competitive bidding specified lands identified for disposition near Victorville, California, and provides for the acquisition of environmentally sensitive land and interests with the proceeds of such sale.</summary>
