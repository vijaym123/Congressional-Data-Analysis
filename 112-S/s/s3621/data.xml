Seniors' Financial Bill of Rights Act - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 (OAA) to include financial counseling and legal assistance, particularly with regard to powers of attorney and the duties of agents or attorneys under a power of attorney, and of fiduciaries, among the services provided by Aging and Disability Resource Centers. Makes it a duty of the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Aging to coordinate with other federal agencies any activities and research related to the economic security and financial exploitation of older individuals and to use them to make available to states and local organizations resources, technical assistance, and information to carry out the State Seniors' Financial Bills of Rights, as well as certain other activities. Requires the state OAA plan to include an assurance that the state will establish a State Seniors' Financial Bill of Rights meeting specified criteria.</summary>
