Preserving Access to Targeted, Individualized, and Effective New Treatments and Services (PATIENTS) Act of 2011 or the PATIENTS Act of 2011 - Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) from using data obtained from comparative effectiveness research, including such research that is conducted or supported using funds appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) or authorized or appropriated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to deny or delay coverage of an item or service under a federal health care program. Requires the Secretary to ensure that comparative effectiveness research conducted or supported by the federal government accounts for factors contributing to differences in the treatment response and preferences of patients, including patient-reported outcomes, genomics and personalized medicine, the unique needs of health disparity populations, and indirect patient benefits.</summary>
