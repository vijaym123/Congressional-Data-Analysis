  <summary>5/10/2012--Introduced.
Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2012 or FACT Act - Amends federal bankruptcy law concerning a trust formed under a plan of reorganization following the discharge in bankruptcy of a debtor corporation in order to assume the debtor's liability with respect to claims seeking recovery for personal injury, wrongful death, or property damage allegedly caused by the presence of, or exposure to, asbestos or asbestos-containing products. Requires such a trust to file with the bankruptcy court and the U.S. Trustee quarterly reports, available on the public docket, which describe each demand the trust has received from a claimant and the basis for any payment made to that claimant (excluding any confidential medical record or the claimant's full Social Security number). Requires such reports also to provide any information relating to payment from, and demands for payment from, the trust to any party to any action in law or equity if the subject concerns liability for asbestos exposure.</summary>
