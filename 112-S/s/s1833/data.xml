  <summary>11/9/2011--Introduced.
Fair Compliance Act of 2011 - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide an extension of at least two years of the deadline to comply with any emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units that the Administrator may promulgate based on the proposed rule entitled "National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units." Requires the Administrator to: (1) provide adequate time for each state to adopt and submit state implementation plan revisions for the implementation of the emissions reductions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from electric utility steam generating units required by the final rule entitled "Federal Implementation Plans: Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone and Correction of SIP Approvals"; and (2) extend the date by which each state shall implement such reductions until no earlier than January 1, 2015, for first phase of the emissions reductions and January 1, 2017, for the second phase. Requires each owner or operator of such unit that is subject to any emissions standard for hazardous air pollutants to submit: (1) a draft implementation plan for the expeditious implementation of the applicable emissions reduction requirements to the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) by July 1, 2012 for review, (2) a revised plan to the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy (DOE) by December 1, 2012, and (3) a report describing the progress made in implementing the plan to the Administrator and the Secretary by December 1, 2014, and annually thereafter. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Administrator: (1) a final implementation plan no later than 60 days after submission of a draft plan to ERO, and (2) a report on progress on implementing emissions control measures in a manner that ensures the reliability of the local and regional electricity systems by March 31, 2015, and annually thereafter through 2018.</summary>
