Requires the design of such coins to be a close likeness of the two gold and one half-dollar coins issued by the San Francisco Mint at the opening of the Pan-Pacific Exposition and the medal awarded to every U.S. citizen who worked for a continuous two-year period on the construction of the Panama Canal. Restricts the issuance of such coins to the one-year period beginning on January 1, 2015. Prescribes the sale price of the coins and coin surcharges. Requires such surcharges to be distributed to: (1) the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society for the design and construction of appropriate exhibitions in the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society; and (2) the National Park Foundation to be used for programs, construction, or preservation work at President Theodore Roosevelt's home in Oyster Bay, New York."
