  <summary>12/4/2012--Introduced.
Repeals the requirement that the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) prescribe regulations to require passenger motor vehicle dealers to distribute to prospective buyers information comparing insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger motor vehicles based on damage susceptibility and crashworthiness. Declares any regulations promulgated pursuant to that requirement to have no force or effect. Directs the Secretary, after providing for public comment, to study and report to Congress on the most useful data, format, and method for providing simple and understandable damage susceptibility information to consumers.</summary>
