  <summary>1/13/2012--Reported to Senate without amendment.
American Battlefield Protection Program Amendments Act of 2011 - Amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, with respect to the Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program, to: (1) expand the current definition of "battlefield report" to include the report entitled "Report to Congress on the Historic Preservation of Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Sites in the United States"; and (2) expand the Program to permit the acquisition not only of an "interest in an eligible site," but also an "eligible site." Requires acquisitions of lands or interests under the Act to be from willing sellers only. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit to Congress a report on activities carried out under this Act. Authorizes appropriations through FY2022 to the Secretary for the provision of grants for the protection of Civil War, Revolutionary War, and War of 1812 battlefields.</summary>
