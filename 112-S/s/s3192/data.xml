  <summary>5/16/2012--Introduced.
Sustaining our Most Advanced Researchers and Technology Jobs Act of 2012 or the SMART Jobs Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish an F-4 nonimmigrant visa for an alien who has been accepted and plans to attend an accredited graduate program for a degree in a STEM field (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) at an institution of higher education in the United States. Requires an F-4 alien to demonstrate an intent to: (1) return to his or her country of residence upon completion or termination of such qualifying graduate program, or (2) obtain U.S. employment in a STEM field and become a permanent U.S. resident upon completion of the graduate program which was the basis for such nonimmigrant status. States that an F-4 visa shall be valid: (1) during the intended period of graduate study, (2) for an additional one year period if the alien is pursuing an offer of STEM field employment, and (3) for an additional six month period while the alien's application for permanent resident status adjustment is pending. States that an alien shall qualify for permanent resident status adjustment if he or she: (1) has F-4 status and has earned an advanced STEM field degree at an institution of higher education, and (2) is employed full-time in the United States in a STEM field position.</summary>
