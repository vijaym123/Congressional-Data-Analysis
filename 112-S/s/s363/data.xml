  <summary>6/15/2012--Public Law.
(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on November 10, 2011. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to convey specified property under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to the city of Pascagoula, Mississippi, provided that the United States receives consideration of at least the fair market value of the property or rights conveyed. Specifies acceptable forms of property, cash, and in-kind consideration. Directs the Secretary to determine fair market value based on a highest- and best-use appraisal conforming with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Professional Appraisal Practice. Requires that the proceeds from any such conveyance be available to the Secretary, subject to appropriation, for activities related to the operations of, or capital improvements to, NOAA property. Allows the Secretary to grant or convey a right of way or easement to the city.</summary>
