Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, with respect to loans guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for multifamily transitional housing for veterans and their families, to: (1) pay the guarantee amount, in full or in part, if the loan is not in default; and (2) forgive, waive, release, or discharge (waive) the borrower's liability with respect to the loan. Provides that the amount paid or waived: (1) shall not be included in the borrower's gross income; and (2) with respect to the low-income housing credit, shall not be treated as an amount derived from a federal grant and shall not otherwise reduce the borrower's depreciable or eligible basis for such housing project.</summary>
