  <summary>3/1/2011--Passed Senate without amendment.
Prohibits Members of Congress and the President from receiving basic pay for any period in which: (1) there is more than a 24-hour lapse in appropriations for any federal agency or department that results from failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution, or (2) the federal government is unable to make payments or meet obligations because the public debt limit has been reached. Bars such forfeited pay from being paid retroactively.</summary>
