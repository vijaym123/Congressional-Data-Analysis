Accountability to Choices of Taxpayers In Our Nation's Budget Priorities - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to revise individual income tax forms to: (1) contain the latest estimate of federal expenditures in budget authority and show the percentage of the federal budget allocated to&#160;specified categories, including social security, education, defense, international affairs, energy, environment, agriculture, and interest on the public debt; and (2) allow taxpayers to indicate&#160;what they believe is the&#160;appropriate percentage share for each category of the next federal budget. Requires the Secretary to aggregate the results with appropriate demographic detail, including results by state, and to provide such information to Congress by July 1 of each year.</summary>
