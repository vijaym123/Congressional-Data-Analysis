  <summary>9/20/2012--Introduced.
Declares that no presidential permit shall be required for a specified pipeline application filed on May 4, 2012, by TransCanada Corporation to the Department of State for the northern portion of the Keystone XL pipeline from the Canadian border to the South Dakota/Nebraska border. Considers the final environmental impact statement regarding such pipeline issued by the Secretary of State on August 26, 2011, to satisfy all requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. States that nothing in this Act affects the ongoing work of the state of Nebraska with regard to the fully intrastate portion of the Keystone XL pipeline.</summary>
