    "text": "Secondary School Reentry Act of 2011 - Amends part H (School Dropout Prevention) of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to make consortia of local educational agencies (LEAs) eligible to receive school dropout prevention grants and subgrants. Requires LEAs that receive a subgrant under part H to use at least 30% of the funds to implement reentry programs that assist school dropouts in returning to the educational system to obtain a secondary school diploma. Requires the reentry programs to be implemented through a partnership between a state, an LEA or consortium of LEAs, and at least one of the following: (1) a community-based organization, (2) an institution of higher education, (3) a local government agency, (4) a business group, (5) a community or national service program, (6) a qualified intermediary, or (7) other education provider. Sets forth reentry program requirements that include providing dropouts with outreach services and participants with: (1) a reenrollment counselor; (2) a rigorous, interdisciplinary education that is aligned to state standards; (3) internships, work experience, or service-learning that gives them secondary or postsecondary school credits; and (4) targeted support services. Directs the Secretary of Education to evaluate the effectiveness of reentry programs. Requires states to include certain student dropout and reentry information in their annual report cards under part A of title I of the ESEA. Amends part D of title I of the ESEA to require states to work with LEAs in developing and implementing school reentry programs for neglected, delinquent, and at-risk youth."
