    "text": "Improving Student Achievement and Engagement through Expanded Learning Time Act of 2011 - Amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program under part B of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Requires states to use at least 95% of the grant allotted to them under part B to award subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs), nonprofit organizations, or partnerships between LEAs and nonprofit organizations or local governmental entities. Creates two types of subgrants: (1) one-year planning subgrants for use in developing and implementing expanded learning time programs as part of a community learning center; and (2) renewable, multi-year implementation subgrants for use in creating expanded learning time, before and after school, summer enrichment, or summer school programs as part of a community learning center. Defines an \"expanded learning time program\" as a program that: (1) applies to all students in a school; (2) increases total school hours by at least 300 hours through an expanded school day, week, or year schedule; and (3) provides additional time for instruction in core academic subjects and additional time for school staff to collaborate, plan, and engage in professional development across grades and subjects. Establishes specified community learning center performance indicators to assess success in creating additional learning time and improving student achievement. Reauthorizes appropriations for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program for FY2012-FY2017."
