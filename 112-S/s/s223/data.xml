(Sec. 102) Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) out of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for FY2010-FY2011 for: (1) air navigation facilities and equipment, (2) civil aviation research and development (R&amp;D), (3) grants for airport planning and development and for noise compatibility planning programs, and (4) administrative expenses for certain airport programs. (Sec. 103) Directs the FAA Administrator to establish a program to utilize undergraduate and technical colleges, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, tribally controlled colleges and universities, and Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian serving institutions in research on subjects of relevance to the FAA. (Sec. 105) Authorizes additional appropriations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for the FAA Operations account for other aviation programs. (Sec. 106) Requires the Airway Capital Investment Plan published by the FAA Administrator to include a list of the Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System projects that do not have as a primary purpose to operate or maintain the current air traffic control system. (Sec. 107) Makes certain funds available for FY2010-FY2011 for Airport Improvement Program (AIP) administrative expenses. Requires the FAA Administrator to: (1) report to Congress and the Secretary on every U.S. airport that reported between 10,000 and 15,000 passenger enplanements during each of the two most recent years; and (2) document methods used by each airport to reach the 10,000 passenger enplanement threshold, including whether they subsidize commercial flights to reach such threshold. Title II: Airport Improvements - (Sec. 201) Revises procedural requirements for imposition of aircraft passenger facility charges (PFCs). (Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary to establish an alternative PFC collection pilot program at up to six airports which does not involve collection by a domestic or foreign air carrier for the flight segment. Requires the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on alternative means of collecting PFCs without their being included in the airline ticket price. (Sec. 203) Revises requirements for written assurances to allow: (1) as an AIP project cost the cost of relocating or replacing an airport due to a change in design standards beyond the control of an airport owner or operator; and (2) for reinvestment in specified other kinds of AIP projects, or transfer to another airport, of proceeds, in an AIP project for acquiring land, from disposition of the land proportional to the government's share of the cost of acquiring it. Declares that a lease of land acquired for a noise compatibility purpose using an AIP grant shall not be considered a disposal of such land at fair market value in the event the land is no longer needed for a noise compatibility purpose. Authorizes such owners or operators to use lease revenues for airport capital projects. Requires the FAA Administrator to coordinate with airport owners or operators to ensure that such leases are consistent with noise buffering purposes. (Sec. 204) Prescribes a special rule for the federal share of up to 95% of allowable costs for AIP projects for two years following transition of an airport's status from small hub to medium hub airport. (Sec. 205) Replaces requirements for allowing as an AIP project cost the cost of terminal development in a nonrevenue-producing public-use area of a commercial service airport with requirements for allowing the cost of relocating or replacing an airport-owned facility as an AIP project cost. Directs the FAA Administrator to analyze the conclusions of ongoing studies of commercially-available bird radar systems and, if they have no negative impact on existing navigational aids, permit their purchase as an allowable AIP project cost. (Sec. 206) Revises exceptions to the prohibition against use of local taxes on aviation fuel or the revenues generated by an airport that is the subject of federal assistance. Excepts from such prohibition any proceeds from the sale of a private airport to a public sponsor that meets specified criteria, including repayment to the Secretary of the remaining unamortized portion of the AIP grant. (Sec. 207) Increases from 90% to 95% the federal share of costs for a grant made in FY2008, FY2009, FY2010, or FY2011 for certain AIP projects. (Sec. 207[b]) Revises eligibility requirements for airport-related projects to exclude projects for the construction of bicycle storage facilities. (Sec. 208) Adds Afghanistan-Iraq war veterans to veterans preference requirements for contracts involving labor on AIP projects. Requires that preference as well be given to the use of small business concerns owned and controlled by disabled veterans Revises reporting requirements of the Secretary's annual AIP report to Congress, moving its deadline from April 1 to June 1. Sunsets the airport security program as of September 30, 2008. Revises requirements for special apportionments for airport noise compatibility planning and program grants to replace the 35% apportionment with a flat $300 million. Applies the same apportionment, also, to water quality mitigation projects approved in an environmental record of decision for an AIP project. Authorizes the Secretary to apportion to an airport sponsor in a fiscal year an amount equal to the amount apportioned to that sponsor in the previous fiscal year if: (1) the airport received scheduled or unscheduled air service from a large certified air carrier, and (2) the airport had more than 10,000 passenger boardings in the preceding calendar year. Extends to FY2008-FY2011 the special rule for apportioning $500,000 to an airport sponsor if the average annual passenger boardings at the airport for calendar years 2004 through 2006 were below 10,000 per year, and other requirements apply. Prescribes a special rule for FY2010-FY2011. Allows an airport sponsor apportionment in FY2010 or FY2011 equal to the amount apportioned to that sponsor in FY2009 for an airport: (1) that had more than 10,000 passenger boardings and scheduled passenger aircraft service in calendar year 2007; but (2) in either calendar years 2008 or 2009, or both years, the number of passenger boardings at the airport decreased to below 10,000 per year. Extends the meaning of "airport development," for AIP project grant purposes, to construction of mobile refueler parking within a fuel farm at a nonprimary airport meeting specified requirements. Revises the minimum amount to be credited to the AIP discretionary fund from amounts made available for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning and programs. Replaces the current formula for such minimum amount with a flat $520 million. States that such amount does not include any amounts apportioned in a prior fiscal year that remain available for obligation. (Sec. 209) Requires any federal agency that must approve, license, or permit a proposed action by a participating state to coordinate and consult with that state. Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program for up to three states to participate in the AIP state block grant program. (Sec. 210) Authorizes the FAA Administrator to accept funds from an airport sponsor to conduct special environmental studies related to a federally funded airport project or for special studies or reviews to support approved noise compatibility measures in a Part 150 program or environmental mitigation in an FAA Record of Decision or Finding of No Significant Impact. (Sec. 211) Authorizes the Secretary to make AIP grants to airport operators to assist in completing environmental review and assessment activities for implementation of proposed flight procedures under the airport noise compatibility planning program. (Sec. 212) Makes current or former military airports that are found to be critical to the safety of transoceanic air traffic eligible for certain discretionary grant funding used to develop current or former such airports. (Sec. 213) Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program to carry out up to six environmental mitigation demonstration projects at public-use airports that will measurably reduce or mitigate aviation impacts on noise, air quality, or water quality in the airport vicinity. (Sec. 214) Allows AIP project costs if for airport development and: (1) is incurred before execution of the grant agreement (but in the same fiscal year) due to the short construction season in the airport's vicinity; (2) accords with an approved airport layout plan; and (3) the airport sponsor notifies the Secretary before commencing work on the project, has an alternative funding source, and any decision to proceed with the project in advance of execution of the agreement does not affect the priority assigned to the project for the allocation of discretionary funds. (Sec. 215) Makes the acquisition of glycol recovery vehicles by an airport owner or operator an allowable AIP project cost. (Sec. 216) Directs the FAA Administrator to conduct research to support programs that reduce aircraft emission of gases and particulates. (Sec. 217) Establishes pursuant to a specified formula a minimum guaranteed apportionment of AIP grants to airports in the U.S. territories. (Sec. 218) Releases certain Merrill Field Airport land, without monetary consideration, to the municipality of Anchorage, Alaska, for conveyance to or use by the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities of the state of Alaska for construction or reconstruction of a federally subsidized highway project. (Sec. 219) Authorizes the Secretary, subject to specified conditions, to release specified restrictions on the use of certain property conveyed to the city of St. George, Utah, for airport purposes. (Sec. 220) Increases from one to three the number of general aviation airports that were closed or realigned former military installations that may be eligible for AIP grants as designated current or former military airports. (Sec. 221) Directs the FAA Administrator to establish an airport sustainability working group to assist in the development of consensus-based best practices and metrics for the sustainable design, construction, planning, and operation of airports. Directs the Working Group to submit to the FAA Administrator a report containing the best practices and standards. Prohibits the authorization of funds for the Working Group. (Sec. 222) Declares it is U.S. policy that measures to improve the efficiency of airport buildings should be included in AIP projects, such as measures designed to meet criteria for a high-performance green building, if increased upfront project costs from such measures are justified by expected savings over the lifecycle of the project. (Sec. 223) Directs the FAA Administrator to study and report to Congress on the feasibility and advisability of apportioning AIP funds to primary airports in proportion to the number of passenger boardings at such an airport during the prior year bears to the aggregate of all passenger boardings at all primary airports during that year. (Sec. 224) Authorizes the FAA Administrator to declare certain revenue derived from the mining of minerals at a general aviation airport to be revenue greater than that needed by the airport to carry out a five-year capital improvement program to comply with FAA design and safety standards. Allows an airport sponsor who complies with specified conditions to allocate such revenues for federal, state, or local transportation infrastructure projects carried out by the airport sponsor. Title III: Air Traffic Control Modernization and FAA Reform - (Sec. 301) Establishes an Air Traffic Control Modernization Oversight Board, to be appointed by the Secretary, to provide specific oversight of FAA's modernization activities. (Effectively replaces the Federal Aviation Management Advisory Council, appointed by the FAA Administrator, and its Air Traffic Services Subcommittee). (Sec. 302) Requires the FAA Administrator to appoint a Chief NextGen Officer, who shall implement all NextGen programs of the Department of Transportation (DOT). (Sec. 303) Requires the FAA Administrator to consider whether the provision of NextGen air traffic services by nongovernment providers would promote safety and improve efficiency of the National Airspace System. (Sec. 304) Revises the authority of an federal agency head to transfer to or to receive from the FAA non-administrative supplies, personnel, services, and equipment. Allows such a transfer with or (as under current law) without reimbursement (Sec. 305) Repeals the restriction on the FAA's authority to use noncompetitive procurement of goods and services solely to the kind of situation when such property or services are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the FAA. (Sec. 306) Revises the FAA Administrator's authority to provide safety-related (air traffic) training and operational services to foreign aviation authorities to specify that such foreign authorities may be public or private. Allows such training and services to promote aviation efficiency or (as under current law) safety. Authorizes the FAA Administrator to bid competitively to provide such services. (Sec. 307) Allows senior FAA executives and employees to participate in the Presidential Rank Award Program. (Sec. 308) Requires: (1) the FAA Administrator to make recommendations for the realignment of FAA services and facilities to assist in the transition to NextGen facilities, and (2) the Air Traffic Control Modernization Oversight Board to study the Administrator's recommendations and make its independent recommendations to the President and Congress for realignment of aviation services or facilities. (Sec. 309) Amends the Vision 100-Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act to require the head of a participating department or federal agency to designate an office to coordinate its NextGen Air Transportation System activities with other departments or federal agencies.

Allows the Administrator and employees by mutual agreement to adopt procedures for the resolution of disputes or impasses arising in the negotiation of a collective-bargaining agreement. Requires the FAA Administrator and employee bargaining representatives, if their own negotiations and the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) have failed to lead to an agreement, to submit their controversy to the Federal Service Impasses Panel, subject to specified procedures, for binding arbitration. Subjects any voluntary agreement or binding arbitration decision to ratification by the exclusive bargaining representative, if the representative so requests, and approval of the agency head. (Under current law, if the services of the FMCS do not lead to an agreement, the Administrator's proposed change to the personnel management system shall not take effect until 60 days have elapsed after the Administrator has transmitted to Congress the proposed changes, along with the objections and reasoning of the exclusive bargaining employee representatives to the changes.)
