    "text": "Pill Mill Crackdown Act of 2011 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to: (1) double the term of imprisonment and triple the fine for the prohibited distribution of a schedule II or schedule III controlled substance by the operator of a pill mill, (2) increase the penalties for such operator distribution of a controlled substance to a person under age 21 from twice to thrice the maximum punishment or term of supervised release authorized, and (3) exclude such operator distribution from the applicability of provisions authorizing an alternative fine of not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds derived by a defendant from a drug offense. Defines: (1) \"pill mill\" to include a doctor's office, clinic, or health care facility that routinely prescribes or dispenses controlled substances outside the scope of the prevailing standards of medical practice in the community in relation to the prescribing or dispensing of controlled prescription drugs or that routinely violates such Act in relation to the prescribing or dispensing of controlled prescription drugs; and (2) \"operator of a pill mill\" to include any practicing physician affiliated with a pill mill or any owner, director, officer, or partner of a pill mill. Expresses the sense of Congress that such prohibited operator distribution is a violation for which certain property is subject to forfeiture. Requires the proceeds from disposition of such property to be used for controlled substance monitoring programs in the states and for block grants to states for community mental health services and for prevention and treatment of substance abuse. Changes the classification of specified quantities of dihydrocodeinone from a schedule III to a schedule II controlled substance."
