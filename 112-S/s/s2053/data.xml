Jumpstarting Transit-Oriented Development Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to award grants to transit agencies, state or local governments, metropolitan planning organizations, tribal governments, or partnerships among them to establish a specific, implementable strategy for mixed-income, mixed-use development projects that lead to successful transit-oriented development within one-half mile of an existing or planned major transit facility. Defines "major transit facility" to mean: (1) a station that is part of a fixed-guideway public transportation system, (2) a high-speed rail or intercity rail station, (3) a transit hub, or (4) a transit center located in a nonurbanized area. Authorizes the Secretary to make or guarantee loans to eligible borrowers to carry out such projects.</summary>
