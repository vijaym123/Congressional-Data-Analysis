  <summary>2/17/2011--Introduced.
Gulf Stream Protection Act of 2011 - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from granting an oil or gas lease to a bidder conducting oil and gas operations off the coast of Cuba unless the bidder submits to the Secretary: (1) a Cuban oil spill response plan, which includes worst-case-scenario oil discharge plans; and (2) evidence that the bidder has sufficient financial and other resources necessary for a cleanup effort to respond to a worst case scenario oil discharge in Cuba that occurs in, or would impact, the waters of the United States. Requires the Secretary to implement an oil spill risk analysis and planning process for oil spill response plans for nondomestic oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico. Instructs: (1) the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to conduct modeling of the Cuban waters; and (2) the Secretary to take into account any such modeling data collected. Authorizes the Secretary to verify that companies operating in the United States that are conducting drilling operations off the coast of Cuba are subject to standards as stringent as OCSLA standards.</summary>
