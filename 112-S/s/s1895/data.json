    "text": "Upstate Works Act - Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to: (1) direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a program to provide grants to states to establish revolving loan funds to provide loans to small and medium-sized manufacturers to finance the cost of reequipping, expanding, or establishing manufacturing facilities in the United States to produce clean energy technology and energy efficient products or of reducing the energy intensity or greenhouse gas production of a manufacturing facility; and (2) include as an activity of Regional Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology (known as the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Centers) the establishment of a clean energy manufacturing supply chain initiative. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a 50% tax credit for investment in value-added agricultural property. Directs the Secretary of Labor to award grants to assist eligible consortia of businesses that serve counties with populations of no more than a million residents in improving job skills necessary for employment in specific industries. Extends the authorization of appropriations for loans and loan guarantees to extend access to broadband telecommunications services in rural areas through FY2017. Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the Build America Bond program, to: (1) extend until December 31, 2012, the authority to issue such bonds and the authority for payments to issuers of such bonds, (2) reduce the percentage rate of payments to issuers in 2011 and 2012, (3) allow refundings of currently issued bonds, and (4) allow the use of Build America bonds to fund capital expenditures for levees and flood control projects."
