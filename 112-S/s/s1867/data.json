    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "2011-12-01", 
    "text": "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 - Division A: Department of Defense Authorizations - Title I: Procurement - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - (Sec. 101) Authorizes appropriations for FY2012 for the Department of Defense (DOD) for procurement for the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, Air Force, and defense-wide activities, in amounts specified in the funding table in Division D of this Act. Subtitle B: Navy Programs - (Sec. 121) Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to enter into one or more multiyear contracts, beginning with the FY2012 program year, for the procurement of mission avionics and common cockpits for MH-60R/S helicopters. Subtitle C: Air Force Programs - (Sec. 131) Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to procure two advanced extremely high frequency satellites through a fixed-price contract. Authorizes such Secretary to (1) include the use of economic order quantities when resulting in cost savings, as well as cost reduction initiatives; and (2) use incremental funding under such contract for up to six fiscal years. Limits total procurement costs to $3.1 billion, allowing a cost adjustment upon notification to the congressional defense and appropriations committees. Directs such Secretary to: (1) report to such committees within 30 days after entering into such a contract, and (2) submit to such committees a plan to use contract cost savings to improve the capability of military satellite communications. Allows such Secretary to use funds currently available for high frequency satellite space vehicle number 5 for the procurement of parts and the replacement of parts for space vehicle number 6. Expresses the sense of Congress that such Secretary should not enter into such a contract until determining that it will save the Air Force 20% or more over procuring two satellites separately. (Sec. 132) Earmarks the use of specified B-2 bomber aircraft funds for: (1) research, development, test, and evaluation on a conventional mixed load capability for such aircraft, and (2) supporting alternative options for the extremely high frequency terminal Increment 1 program of record. Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to submit to the defense and appropriations committees a plan to provide an extremely high frequency terminal for secure protected communications for the B-2 and other aircraft. (Sec. 134) Prohibits this Act's funds from being obligated or expended: (1) to retire any B-1 bomber aircraft before the date on which the Secretary of the Air Force submits to the defense and appropriations committee a plan for retiring such aircraft; and (2) after such date, to retire more than six of such aircraft. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) at least 60% of the savings achieved in each year through 2022 resulting from such retirements should be reinvested in modernizing and sustaining bomber aircraft, and (2) at least 35% of such amount should be reinvested in modernizing and sustaining the remaining B-1 fleet through such period. (Sec. 135) Prohibits the Secretary of the Air Force from taking any action to prevent maintaining the U-2 aircraft fleet in its current configuration and capability beyond FY2016 until the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (Under Secretary) certifies to the defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees that the operating and sustainment costs for the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle are less than comparable costs for the U-2 on a flight-hour basis. (Sec. 136) Directs the Secretary of the Air Force, as of October 1, 2011, to maintain a total inventory of strategic airlift aircraft of not less than 301. (Sec. 137) Directs the Secretary of the Army, upon a determination to retire a C-23 aircraft, to first offer it for transfer, without charge, to the chief executive officer of the state in which the aircraft is based. Allows such aircraft, after transfer, to continue to be utilized by the National Guard of that state. Requires the state, after the transfer, to assume all aircraft maintenance and operational costs. Subtitle D: Joint and Multiservice Matters - (Sec. 151) Amends the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Skelton Act) to include in quarterly reports on the use of combat mission requirement funds a table setting forth the requirements approved during the fiscal year in which the report is submitted and the two preceding fiscal years, as well as a statement of any unspent funds for such period. (Sec. 152) Directs the Secretary of Defense (Secretary), in entering into a contract for the procurement of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, to ensure that the contract: (1) is a fixed-price contract, and (2) requires the contractor to assume full responsibility for contract costs above the target cost. (Sec. 153) Requires the Under Secretary, at the same time as submission of the FY2013 budget, to report to the defense committees on DOD plans to implement the requirements of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 within the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft program. (Sec. 154) Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to enter into one or more multiyear contracts, beginning with the FY2012 program year, for the procurement of airframes for UH-60M/HH-50M and MH-60R/MH-60S helicopters. (Sec. 155) Directs the Under Secretary to designate the undersea mobility acquisition program of the U.S. Special Operations Command as a major defense acquisition program (MDAP). (Sec. 156) Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop and carry out a plan for the orderly transfer of the Air Force C-12 Liberty intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft to the Army; and (2) report to the defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees on such plan. (Sec. 157) Directs the Air Force Audit Agency to submit to the defense and appropriations committees the results of a financial audit of funds previously authorized and appropriated for the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft re-engining program. (Sec. 158) Requires the Secretary to report to the defense and appropriations committees on the development of the short take-off, vertical landing variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. (Sec. 159) Authorizes the Secretary to transfer to the United Kingdom an F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the carrier variant configuration in exchange for such an aircraft in the short take-off and vertical landing configuration. Provides: (1) funding for the aircraft to be exchanged by the United States, and (2) exchange implementation through a memorandum of understanding.
