    "text": "Healthy Kids from Day One Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award three-year competitive grants to five eligible entities to help reduce and prevent obesity among children from birth to age five in a state and to encourage parental engagement in child care settings outside a child's place of residence. Identifies as eligible entities: (1) a state health department or other appropriate child care licensing entities within the state, or (2) a nonprofit organization or a partnership of nonprofit organizations with expertise in the healthy development of children. Requires grant funds to be used to: (1) establish child care collaboratives; (2) provide funding to entities that routinely train child care providers to establish collaboratives; and (3) provide technical assistance to participating providers, a compilation of best practices, strategies, and lessons learned from the collaborative, and a plan to ensure that the collaborative will be sustainable, without additional federal funding, upon the conclusion of the grants. Requires each collaborative to: (1) share best practices, strategies, and techniques for successfully implementing policies and practices relating to healthy eating, physical activity, parental engagement, and other topics relating to the healthy development of children; and (2) incorporate between 5 and 10 day-long, interactive training sessions each year and ongoing technical assistance to participating child care providers. Directs the Secretary to: (1) award grants to Prevention Research Centers, universities, or other appropriate entities to evaluate programs carried out under such grants; (2) coordinate activities conducted under this Act with activities undertaken by the National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council; and (3) disseminate to all appropriate HHS agencies evidence, strategies, best practices, and lessons learned from grantees."
