  <summary>9/6/2011--Introduced.
Amends title XII (Advances to State Unemployment Fund) of the Social Security Act, as added by the Assistance for Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act, to extend through December 31, 2012, the waiver of certain interest payments on advances made to states from the federal unemployment account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. (Thus continues temporary assistance for states with such advances.) Denies application of this waiver, between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012, to any state that, between January 1, 2011 and enactment of this Act, imposed any tax, assessment, or other charge on any taxpayer to pay interest otherwise due from the state, unless the state makes all reasonable efforts to fully reimburse taxpayers that were subject to such interest assessment.</summary>
