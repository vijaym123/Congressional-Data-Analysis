Allows a whistleblower who alleges discharge or other discrimination to seek relief: (1) by filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor; or (2) if the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days of filing such complaint, to bring an action at law or equity. Entitles a whistleblower who prevails in any such action to all relief necessary to make such whistleblower whole."
