(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on June 27, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 - (Sec. 3) States that it is U.S. policy to: (1) reaffirm the commitment to Israel's security as a Jewish state, (2) support Israel's right to self-defense and help Israel preserve its qualitative military edge, (3) expand military and civilian cooperation, (4) assist in a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that results in two states living side-by-side in peace and security, and (5) veto any one-sided anti-Israel U.N. Security Council resolutions. (Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should take specified actions to assist in Israel's defense, including: (1) enhancing development and production of joint missile defense systems, (2) providing appropriate defense articles and services, (3) strengthening security initiatives and bilateral training exercises, and (4) encouraging an expanded role for Israel with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). (Sec. 5) Amends the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2005 to extend authority to transfer certain obsolete or surplus Department of Defense (DOD) items to Israel. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to extend authority to make additions to foreign-based defense stockpiles. Amends the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 to extend specified loan guarantee authority to Israel. (Sec. 6) Directs the President to submit reports to Congress regarding: (1) the status of Israel's qualitative military edge; (2) actions that could improve the process related to Israel's purchase of F-35 aircraft; (3) cooperation between the United States and Israel in homeland security, counter-terrorism, maritime security, energy, cyber-security, and other related areas; and (4) actions to integrate Israel into the defense of the Eastern Mediterranean.</summary>
