Cites January 1, 2015, as the effective date upon which the net amount of insured deposit due to a depositor at an insured depository institution reverts to the standard statutory maximum ($250,000) for deposit insurance. Requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), to fully offset, in each calendar year, any estimated losses that may occur to the Deposit Insurance Fund and to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, respectively, as a result of this Act by: (1) estimating the losses, if any, that are expected to occur for each calendar year; and (2) collecting an amount equal to such estimated losses by September 30 of the calendar year, in addition to the assessments that would otherwise be collected by either the FDIC or the NCUA with respect to such year for insured depository institutions."
