Revises the FLTFA definition of \"federally designated area\" to include all the lands within specified boundaries. (Current law is limited to lands which, as of July 25, 2000, were within such specified boundaries.) Makes the FLTFA non-applicable to land eligible for sale under specified public land laws."
