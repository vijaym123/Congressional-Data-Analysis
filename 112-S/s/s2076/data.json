Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to permit states and other grant recipients under the State Homeland Security Grant Program, the Urban Area Security Initiative, and Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to use grant funds to improve security at state or local government courthouses. Directs the Administrator of General Services (GSA) to ensure that state or local governments have an opportunity to request excess security equipment (metal detectors, wands, baggage screening devices) for state or local courthouses having less security equipment than such courthouses require before such equipment is made available to any other individual or entity. Requires that priority be given to courthouses that have no security equipment."
