Requires the Northern Cheyenne Tribe to waive each legal claim relating to the failure of the United States to acquire in trust for the Tribe the private mineral interests underlying the Cheyenne tracts as part of the Tribe's reservation. Instructs the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and Great Northern Properties to jointly notify the Secretary in writing when they have agreed on a formula for the sharing of revenue from the coal produced from the federal tracts."
