Allows the Secretary, in establishing such minimum levels, to establish hold-harmless criteria for states and exclude consideration of counties with a population density of less than one person per square mile. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the needs of veterans residing in an area consisting of a county or counties with fewer than seven persons per square mile."
