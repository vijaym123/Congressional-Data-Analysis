Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to renew a five-year grant for up to an additional two years. Specifies the federal share of services or activities covered by such a grant for the sixth and seventh fiscal year. Directs the Secretary to reserve a certain portion of appropriations for awarding grants for each of FY2012-FY2016 to regional partnerships that have not been awarded such a grant in any of FY2007-FY2011. Limits the amount of funds reserved for awarding such grants that may be used for the Secretary's administrative expenses. Requires the Secretary to evaluate the effectiveness of such grants awarded to regional partnerships and report the results on the HHS website."
