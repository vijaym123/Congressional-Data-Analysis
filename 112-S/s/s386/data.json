Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) extend the 6.2% employment tax rate for employers through 2013 and impose a reduced 5.78% rate in 2014, (2) modify the rate applicable to the limit on the credit allowed to employers for the federal unemployment tax, and (3) increase the taxable wage base for the federal unemployment tax to $15,000 in 2014. Amends title IX of the Social Security Act (Miscellaneous Provisions Relating to Employment Security) to increase the rate of interest payable on unemployment compensation reserves and lower the rate of the employment tax for employers in states whose unemployment compensation fund remains solvent."
