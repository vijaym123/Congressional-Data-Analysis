Directs the Secretary to adjust such amounts annually based on the residential home cost-of-construction index. Removes a provision that prohibits providing such assistance after December 31, 2011. Expands the eligibility for specially adapted housing assistance provided by the Secretary for veterans with certain vision impairments. Removes certain limitations on the aggregate amount of assistance available for adapting and acquiring such housing for individuals residing temporarily in housing owned by a family member."
