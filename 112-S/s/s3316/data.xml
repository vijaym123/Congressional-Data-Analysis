  <summary>6/20/2012--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Labor to commence a one-year pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of providing veterans seeking employment with access to computing facilities in order to facilitate their access to websites that: (1) match such veterans with available jobs based on skills acquired as members of the Armed Forces, and (2) allow employers to post information about available jobs. Requires the Secretary to provide such veterans with assistance in using such facilities. Repeals a required annual report from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) on the use of authorities for retaining experienced nurses in the Veterans Health Administration.</summary>
