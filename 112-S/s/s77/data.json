Requires the Administrator to: (1) provide such assistance to building owners based on the extent to which projects relating to the buildings of the owners result in verifiable, additional, and enforceable reductions in emissions of air pollutants through operational improvements such as improved energy efficiency, increased water-use efficiency, and use of renewable energy sources; and (2) give priority to projects that achieve minimum scores in energy performance evaluations and result in measurable pollution reduction benefits not encompassed within the metrics of the Energy Star program."
