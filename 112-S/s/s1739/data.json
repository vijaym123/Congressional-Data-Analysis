Requires that the Tribe's claim for reimbursement of expended funds be certified by the Tribe as being unreimbursed to it from other funding sources. Requires the Tribe to provide the Secretary with updated membership rolls for the Boise Forte Band, Fond du Lac Band, Grand Portage Band, Leech Lake Band, Mille Lacs Band, and White Earth Band of the Tribe. Directs the Secretary to set aside a specified amount of the judgment funds for distribution to each member enrolled with each Band and then divide the remaining funds into equal shares for each Band."
