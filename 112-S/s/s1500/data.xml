Ensure Children Have Health Care Act - Permits a health insurance issuer that is licensed to offer child-only health insurance coverage in one state to also offer such coverage to eligible residents of other states. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) provide for the application of a uniform annual enrollment period for such coverage; and (2) promulgate regulations that provide protections to enrollees, ensure the solvency of health insurance issuers that offer such coverage, and clarify the procedures that would apply when an enrollee has a complaint concerning his or her coverage.</summary>
