Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization Act of 2011 - Revises and reauthorizes programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Title I: Ensuring College and Career Readiness for All Students - Part A: Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged - (Sec. 1111) Revises the school improvement program under part A of title I of the ESEA. Maintains the requirement conditioning a state's receipt of funds under part A on its developing and implementing academic content and achievement standards and assessments that are applicable to all public elementary and secondary schools and school students in the state. Requires states to adopt college and career ready academic: (1) content standards in reading or language arts and mathematics by the end of 2013; and (2) achievement standards in those disciplines by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year. Requires college and career ready standards to be aligned with: (1) academic coursework at public institutions of higher education (IHEs) in the state, (2) relevant state career and technical education standards, and (3) appropriate career skills. Requires the achievement standards to establish basic, on-track, and advanced levels of student performance. Allows states to meet these requirements individually or through a consortium with other states. Requires states to adopt academic content and achievement standards in science by the end of 2013 that are aligned with the knowledge and skills needed to be college and career ready. Requires states to adopt, by the close of 2014, high-quality English language proficiency standards that are aligned with their academic content standards in reading or language arts so that students can be reliably measured in those disciplines. Requires English learners (currently referred to as limited English proficient students) to be tested against those proficiency standards on an annual basis. Allows states to adopt alternate academic achievement standards and assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Requires the decision about which students should be measured against these standards to be made separately for each student in each subject assessed. Requires states, by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year, to adopt and implement statewide assessments that measure student achievement against: (1) the reading or language arts and mathematics standards annually in grades 3-8 and at least once during grades 10-12; and (2) the science standards at least once in grades 3-6, 6-9, and 10-12; (3) the English language proficiency standards; and (4) any alternate academic achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Allows the assessments in reading or language arts and mathematics to be administered through a single annual summative assessment or through multiple assessments during an academic year, provided the multiple assessments yield a summative score that reliably measures college and career readiness. Allows states to use student growth as a measure of academic progress. Allows states to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments that measure whether each student is meeting or exceeding the on-track performance level for the student's grade level. Allows those assessments to measure student growth above or below grade level. Requires states to reduce duplicative assessments. Requires each state receiving part A funds to prepare and disseminate an annual report card on the performance of each public elementary and secondary school in the state, each local educational agency (LEA) in the state, and the state as a whole. Requires the report cards to include specified student information in the aggregate and disaggregated and cross-tabulated by student subgroup. (Sec. 1113) Alters the formula LEAs are to use to: (1) rank the poverty of school attendance areas if school improvement funds are insufficient to serve all areas, and (2) calculate the number of low-income students in secondary schools. Requires LEAs to reserve part A funds to serve foster care children. Allows reserved funds to be used to provide homeless children and youth with services not ordinarily provided to other children under part A. (Sec. 1116) Eliminates the requirement that LEAs and their elementary and secondary schools make adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward state performance standards or be subject to specified improvements, corrective action, or restructuring. Requires, instead, that each state accountability system: (1) use the assessments and high school graduation rates to annually measure and report on the performance of their elementary and secondary schools and LEAs; and (2) require the improvement, through supports and interventions that address student needs, of all of their public schools that are low-performing or have low-performing subgroups of poor, minority, disabled, and English learner students. Requires state accountability systems to include student performance in reading or language arts and mathematics. Allows states to include other subjects, such as science, for which they have adopted academic content and achievement standards. Requires that system to identify the schools that are achievement gap schools and persistently low-achieving schools and the school improvement strategies to be used for such schools. Identifies as achievement gap schools the 5% of public high schools in a state and 5% of public elementary and secondary schools in a state that are not high schools and that are not identified as persistently low-achieving, but that have the largest achievement gap among any of the ethnic, poor, disabled, and English learner student subgroups or the lowest performance by students in such subgroups in the state. Requires each LEA that serves an achievement gap school to develop and implement a measurable and data-driven correction plan to improve the performance of the school's low-achieving subgroups. Makes LEAs that have an achievement gap school that has been identified as such for more than three consecutive years ineligible for any preference under ESEA-funded programs. Requires states to identify their lowest-achieving schools each year, which include: (1) the lowest-achieving 5% of public high schools in the state and the lowest-achieving 5% of public elementary and secondary schools in the state that are not high schools; and (2) the public high schools in the state that have less than a 60% graduation rate. Requires each state to notify the parents of students attending such schools of a school's status as one of its lowest-achieving schools. Requires states to compile a list of its schools identified as lowest-achieving that: (1) receive assistance under part A of title I of the ESEA, (2) are public high schools at least 50% of whose students are low-income students, or (3) are public high schools that have less than a 60% graduation rate. Requires the list to be made publicly available, including through the Internet. Identifies as persistently low-achieving schools those schools that have been on that list for two consecutive school years (though for the 2013-2014 school year, a school on the list the preceding school year shall be so identified). Continues their characterization as such for the five years following their identification, unless the state determines that they have improved and no longer deserve that characterization. Allows states to apply to the Secretary of Education for a waiver from the requirement to identify schools as persistently low-achieving if they determine that all of their schools are performing at a satisfactory level. Requires LEAs receiving part A funds to conduct a data-driven needs analysis of each of their persistently low-achieving schools and use it to select and implement the most appropriate school improvement strategy to improve student performance at each school. Requires all of the school improvement strategies to provide: (1) school staff with ongoing training and performance evaluations, and (2) students with instruction and instructional supports that meet their individual needs. Identifies the school improvement strategies as: (1) the transformation strategy, (2) the strategic staffing strategy, (3) the turnaround strategy, (4) the whole school reform strategy, (5) the restart strategy, and (6) the school closure strategy. Includes as part of the transformation strategy: (1) replacing the principal, if the principal has served in that role at the school for more than two years, with a principal that has had more training, experience, or success; (2) requiring instructional and leadership personnel to reapply for their positions; and (3) requiring hiring at the school to be done through mutual consent. Includes as part of the strategic staffing strategy: (1) replacing the principal, if the principal has served in that role at the school for more than two years, with a principal that has had more training, experience, or success; (2) allowing the new principal to staff the school with a school turnaround team of the principal's choosing; and (3) providing incentives to the principal and teachers to participate in the initiative. Includes as part of the turnaround strategy: (1) replacing the principal, if the principal has served in that role at the school for more than two years, with a principal that has had more training, experience, or success; and (2) screening all teachers in the school and retaining not more than 65% of them. Identifies the whole school reform strategy as one undertaken in partnership with a strategy developer offering a school reform program that is based on at least a moderate level of evidence that it will have a statistically significant effect on student outcomes. Includes as part of the restart strategy: (1) converting the school into a public charter, magnet, or innovative school; (2) allowing students of the former school to enroll in the new school; and (3) using a random lottery system to admit additional students if the new school has more applicants than it can accommodate. Requires LEAs implementing the school closure strategy to enroll students who attended the closed school in higher-performing schools that are within reasonable proximity to the closed school. Allows school improvement funds to be used to support the costs the higher-performing schools incur in meeting the needs of these new students. Allows states, with the Secretary's approval, to establish an alternative state-determined school improvement strategy to be used by their LEAs. Requires LEAs to: (1) implement the restart or school closure strategy for schools that continue to be classified as persistently low-achieving after the completion of their initial five-year improvement strategy; and (2) allow students at persistently low-achieving schools to transfer to another public school that has not been identified as persistently low-achieving, unless that option is prohibited by state law. (Sec. 1117) Replaces the School Support and Recognition program with the Blue Ribbon Schools program that allows each state to annually identify the top 5% of its schools as blue ribbon schools based on: (1) the percentage of their students who are on track to college and career readiness for English or language arts and mathematics; (2) in the case of high schools, their graduation rates; (3) the performance of their student subgroups; (4) the percentage of their students attaining growth, if the state measures growth; and (5) school gains. Allows states to provide each blue ribbon school with: (1) increased autonomy over its budget, staffing, and time; (2) flexibility in using funds provided to the school under the ESEA for any purpose allowed under the ESEA; and (3) a monetary award, through its LEA, if it agrees to use the reward to improve student achievement and provide technical assistance to the lowest-achieving schools in the state that have characteristics similar to it. (Sec. 1118) Revises parental involvement provisions to require LEAs to develop and implement strategic, evidence-based plans to support the meaningful engagement of parents and other family members in children's education. Allows LEAs to involve employers, business leaders, philanthropic and nonprofit organizations, and other community members in efforts to strengthen parent and family engagement in their children's education. (Sec. 1119) Requires teachers to be highly-qualified if teaching a core academic subject in a program supported with school improvement funds, but makes this requirement applicable only to new teachers if the state has fully implemented a teacher and principal evaluation system. Allows LEAs that are unable to provide a small, rural, or remote school with a highly-qualified on-site classroom teacher for a core academic subject to use distance education provided by a teacher highly qualified in the subject, but only if a teacher highly-qualified in another subject is present in the classroom to assist students during the distance education. Excepts teachers of American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian language, culture, or history from the requirement that teachers be highly qualified. Allows states to require a local tribe or tribal organization to verify those teachers' competency. Prohibits a state from requiring a school or LEA to spend a specific amount of funds for professional development activities under part A. (Sec. 1121) Conditions an LEA's receipt of part A funds, beginning with the 2015-2016 school year, on the LEA showing its state that combined state and local per-pupil expenditures in each of its schools served under part A are not less than the average combined state and local per-pupil expenditures for each of its schools not served under that program. Requires an LEA that serves all of its schools under part A to show its state that the average combined state and local per-pupil expenditures for its high-poverty schools were not less than those expenditures for its low-poverty schools. Allows LEAs to meet these requirements on an LEA-wide or grade-span by grade-span basis. Requires LEAs to exclude from these calculations state and local funds expended in any school for capital expenditures or the excess costs of providing services to English learners or disabled children. (Sec. 1122) Requires LEAs to engage in specified activities with Head Start agencies, special education providers, and other federal early childhood care and education providers to ease the transition of children into elementary education. (Sec. 1126) Directs the Secretary to award grants to states to develop, improve, or administer their college and career ready academic standards and assessments. Directs the Secretary to award competitive grants to states to enhance such assessments by: (1) collaborating with IHEs or other entities, (2) using multiple measures of student achievement from multiple sources, (3) charting student progress over time, or (4) developing comprehensive assessment instruments. Reauthorizes appropriations under part A of title I of the ESEA for FY2012-FY2016. Part B: Pathways to College - (Sec. 1201) Replaces part B (Student Reading Skills Improvement Grants) of title I of the ESEA with a new Pathways to College program. Establishes, under subpart 1 (Improving Secondary Schools) of part B, a program awarding competitive, matching, five-year grants to high-need LEAs that partner with public or private nonprofit organizations to assist schools in implementing innovative and effective secondary school reform strategies. Requires grantees to use up to 25% of their grant funds to: (1) implement an early warning indicator system to identify and assist struggling students in their high schools and feeder middle schools; (2) provide support and credit recovery opportunities for struggling secondary school students; (3) establish secondary school dropout recovery or reentry programs; (4) establish grade and school transition programs and supports; and (5) keep school staff, students, and families apprised of certain education requirements, processes, and opportunities. Requires grantees to use at least 75% of their grant funds on certain efforts to: (1) reform secondary schools that have a graduation rate below 75%, that have not received certain school improvement funds, and that they identify as low-performing; and (2) improve the academic performance of students who attend middle schools that feed a majority of their students to those secondary schools. Requires those secondary school reforms to include: (1) personalized learning environments attuned to the needs of each student; (2) student engagement through service, experiential, and work-based learning; (3) flexible budget and staffing authority for school leaders; (4) training and collaborative opportunities for school staff; (5) improved curriculum and instruction; and (6) Graduation Promise Academies, Career Academies, or Early College Schools which represent specified strategies that have proven effective in preparing students for graduation, college, and a career. (Sec. 1202) Establishes a program, under subpart 2 (Accelerated Learning) of part B, allotting grants to states, based on their share of low-income elementary and secondary school students, to cover part or all of the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) examination fee low-income students incur. Directs the Secretary to award competitive matching grants to states, high-need LEAs, or partnerships between a public or nonprofit organization and a state or high-need LEA for activities that increase: (1) the number of teachers at high-need schools who are qualified to teach AP or IB courses, and (2) the number of students at high-need schools who pass the examination for such courses. Gives priority, in awarding the competitive grants, to applicants that: (1) have a statewide or district wide strategy for increasing the availability of AP or IB courses, and pre-AP or pre-IB courses, in high-need schools; (2) focus on increasing AP or IB courses in core academic subjects; and (3) target high-need schools. Authorizes appropriations under part B's Pathways to College program for FY2012-FY2016. Part C: Education of Migratory Children - (Sec. 1301) Amends the program, under part C (Education of Migratory Children) of title I of the ESEA, providing grants to states for the education of migratory children. (Sec. 1302) Alters the formula for determining each state's grant by considering, in addition to other factors, the average number of migratory children residing in each state the preceding three years, rather than the number of migratory children who resided in each state the previous year. Requires the Secretary to develop and implement a procedure for monitoring the accuracy of estimates of the number of migratory children residing in each state. (Sec. 1304) Gives program priority to migratory children who have made a move within the year and are failing or at risk of failing or who have dropped out of school. (Sec. 1306) Requires migratory children to be given the opportunity to meet the same college and career readiness standards as other children. (Sec. 1308) Adds international coordination as an authorized use of the grants currently awarded to states, LEAs, IHEs, and other entities for improved intrastate and interstate coordination of migrant education. Allows the Secretary to provide technical assistance to states to support their efforts to meet the needs of migratory children. (Sec. 1309) Requires each state that receives a grant under part C to: (1) annually report to the Secretary and make public certain data regarding the academic achievement of migratory students, and (2) assist the Secretary in determining the number of migratory children in such state through such procedures as the Secretary may require. Requires the Secretary: (1) to evaluate the implementation and impact of the activities supported under part C, and (2) conduct a pilot study on the feasibility of using the National Assessment of Educational Progress for assessing and reporting on the academic achievement of migratory children in grades four and eight in reading and mathematics. Reauthorizes appropriations under part C of title I of the ESEA for FY2012-FY2016. Part D: Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth Who Are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk - (Sec. 1401) Amends part D (Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth Who are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk) of title I of the ESEA. (Sec. 1403) Requires states that desire grants under part D to establish: (1) procedures to ensure that students who have been placed in the juvenile justice system are promptly re-enrolled in secondary school or placed in re-entry programs that best meet their educational and social needs, (2) procedures for facilitating the transfer of credits that such students earned during placement, and (3) opportunities for those students to participate in higher education or career pathways. (Sec. 1404) Allows states to use grant funds for the cost of testing children and youth for a recognized equivalent of a secondary school diploma. (Sec. 1407) Requires the Secretary to evaluate the implementation and impact of the activities supported under part D. (Sec. 1412) Requires correctional facilities that enter into an agreement with an LEA to provide services to children and youth under part D to: (1) work with the LEA and family members to develop an initial educational services and transition plan for children or youth upon their entry into the correctional facility, and (2) work with the LEA to facilitate the continued achievement of those children and youth upon their discharge from the correctional facility. (Sec. 1413) Requires correctional facilities or institutions for delinquent children and youth to annually report: (1) the number of children and youth they have released who did or did not return to school, (2) the number who obtained a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent, and (3) the number who obtained employment. (Sec. 1414) Requires each state and LEA evaluation of its part D program to assess the program's success in making children and youth college and career ready and able to graduate from high school in a timely manner. (Sec. 1414) Redefines "at-risk" children or youth as school-aged individuals who: (1) are at risk of academic failure; and (2) have a drug or alcohol problem, are pregnant or are parents, have come into contact with the juvenile justice system or have been determined to have been neglected in the past, are gang members, or have dropped out of school in the past. Reauthorizes appropriations under part D of title I of the ESEA for FY2012-FY2016. Part E: Educational Stability of Children in Foster Care - (Sec. 1501) Replaces part E (National Assessment of Subchapter I) of title I of the ESEA with a new part E (Educational Stability of Children in Foster Care) program. Requires states to develop and implement a plan to ensure that children that move to a new school attendance area due to being placed in foster care, changing their foster care placement, or leaving foster care: (1) enroll or remain in their school of origin and receive transportation to and from that school, unless it is determined to be in their best interest to attend a different school; (2) are immediately enrolled in a school once it is determined to be in their best interest to attend the school, even if they are unable to produce the records normally required for enrollment; and (3) have their school records maintained and available for immediate transfer to their new school. Gives a child who leaves foster care the right to remain in his or her school of origin only for the remainder of the school year. Requires states to ensure that foster children are able to: (1) preserve the credits or partial credits they earned at schools they previously attended, and (2) receive a secondary school diploma from one of the schools at which they were enrolled or through a state-issued secondary school diploma system. Requires LEAs and state educational agencies to each designate an individual to oversee implementation of their part E obligations and serve as a point of contact for the child welfare agencies responsible for foster children. Part F: General Provisions - (Sec. 1601) Eliminates parts F (Comprehensive School Reform), G (Advanced Placement Programs), and H (School Dropout Prevention) of title I of the ESEA. Title II: Supporting Excellent Teachers and Principals - (Sec. 2101) Replaces title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) of the ESEA with a new title II (Supporting Excellent Teachers and Principals). Redesignates the Ready-to-Learn Television program (under subpart 3 of part D of title II) as the Ready-to-Learn program under part H of title IV of the ESEA. Redesignates subpart 5 (Teacher Liability Protection) of part C of title II as subpart 3 of part E of title IX (General Provisions) of the ESEA. Transfers responsibility for the operation and administration of the Troops-to-Teachers program (currently under part C of title II of the ESEA) from the Department of Education to the Department of Defense (DOD) and amends the program. (The Troops-to-Teachers program provides military personnel with teacher certification stipends in exchange for three years of service in an elementary or secondary school.) Makes military personnel who are separated or released from active duty after at least four (currently, six) years of continuous active duty eligible to participate in the program. Requires military personnel to apply to participate in the program within two years after the date on which they are retired, separated, or released from active duty. (Currently, they must apply within four years of their retirement, separation, or release.) Strikes parts A (Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund), B (Mathematics and Science Partnerships), C (Innovation for Teacher Quality) and D (Enhancing Education Through Technology) of title II. Establishes a new part A (Continuous Improvement and Support for Teachers and Principals) program under title II. Directs the Secretary, under such program, to make formula grants to states, and through them, subgrants to LEAs to increase student achievement for all students by carrying out one or more of the following activities: professional development; class size reduction for prekindergarten through grade three; developing and implementing induction or mentoring programs; developing and implementing, or improving, a teacher and principal evaluation system; increasing the capacity of teachers to evaluate student work and use student achievement data; recruiting, preparing, placing, supporting, developing, rewarding, and retaining high-quality teachers and principals; improving the equitable distribution of teachers within school districts; enabling teachers to become certified as teachers in a high-need subject or field; creating career ladders that enable high-quality teachers or paraprofessionals to advance or take on additional roles and responsibilities; and reforming their teacher and principal compensation system to attract, retain, and reward high-quality teachers and principals. Allocates part A grants to states and, through them, subgrants to LEAs pursuant to formulae that apportion: (1) 35% of the funding to states and 20% of the funding to LEAs based on their share of students aged 5-17 on the national and state level, respectively; and (2) 65% of the funding to states and 80% of the funding to LEAs based on their share of low-income students in that age group on the national and state level, respectively. Requires states to use 95% of their part A grant for subgrants to LEAs. Requires states to use 2% to 5% of their grant to improve the performance and distribution of high quality principals and, at their discretion, other school leaders. Requires grantees and subgrantees to issue annual reports on: (1) the number of their teachers teaching under a provisional license, and (2) the performance of students taught by graduates of each teacher preparation program within the state. Establishes a Principal Recruitment and Training Grant program awarding renewable, matching grants to states, LEAs, nonprofit organizations, IHEs, and partnerships of those entities to recruit, prepare, place, and support principals in eligible schools. Defines "eligible schools" as high-need schools, persistently low-achieving schools, achievement gap schools, schools with middle grades that feed students to high schools with low graduation rates, and rural schools served by high-need LEAs. Requires grantees to work with experts and stakeholders to develop, during the first year of a grant, a leadership training program for principals, mentors, and other school leaders that prepares and supports them in leading effective school reform efforts in persistently low-achieving schools. Makes grant renewal decisions dependent on the Secretary's evaluation of the extent to which the principals recruited, prepared, placed, or supported by the grantee have improved school-level student outcomes in eligible schools. Establishes a new part B (Teacher Pathways to the Classroom) program under title II of the ESEA. Directs the Secretary to award renewable, matching grants to eligible entities to: (1) recruit, select, prepare, place, retain, and support teachers for high-need schools and high-need subjects or fields; (2) prepare all teachers to teach students with disabilities and English language learners; (3) prepare teachers in classroom management, instructional planning and delivery, learning theory and cognitive development, literacy development, and student assessment; (4) provide school-based, clinical experience at a high-need school that includes the observation of and feedback on teacher candidates' teaching; and (5) provide ongoing mentoring and support, which may include coursework, for participants for at least one school year. Defines an "eligible entity" as: (1) a partnership of at least one IHE or nonprofit organization and a high-need LEA and at least one other LEA or state educational agency; or (2) an IHE or nonprofit organization experienced in preparing successful teachers and placing them in high-need schools. Requires grantees to track the placement rate, retention rate, and performance in improving student achievement of teachers recruited and prepared by their programs. Permits the Secretary to renew a grant only if that data indicates that the teachers are successful in improving student achievement. Requires the Director of the Institute of Education Sciences to: (1) evaluate the implementation and impact of the part B program; (2) identify best practices for recruiting, selecting, preparing, placing, retaining, and supporting teachers in high-need subjects or fields for high-need schools; and (3) disseminate research on best practices. Establishes a new part C (Teacher Incentive Fund) program under title II of the ESEA. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive matching grants to states, LEAs, and nonprofit or for-profit organizations that partner with states or LEAs to develop, implement, improve, or expand: (1) comprehensive performance-based compensation systems that reward teachers and principals who raise student achievement, and (2) teacher and principal evaluation systems that are based in significant part on evidence of improved student achievement. Gives grant priority to applicants that concentrate their proposed activities on teachers and principals serving high-need schools. Requires grantees to provide, over the course of the grant period, an increasing share of matching funds. Allows the Secretary of Education to waive such matching requirement for high-need LEAs. Establishes a new part D under title II of the ESEA, entitled the Achievement Through Technology and Innovation Act of 2011 or the ATTAIN Act. Allots funds to states under subpart 1 (State and Local Grants) of part D on the basis of each state's share of funds under part A of title I of the ESEA. Requires states to use a portion of subpart 1 funds to: (1) develop college and career ready academic content and achievement standards in technological literacy, and (2) assess and track student performance in acquiring technological literacy. Requires states to use the bulk of their allotment for two new subgrant programs for LEAs, devoting: (1) 60% for formula subgrants to improve teaching and learning through technology, and (2) 40% for competitive subgrants for systemic education transformation through technology integration. Requires LEAs to: (1) include a new or updated local long-range strategic educational technology plan in their applications, (2) use a specified percentage of each subgrant for teacher training, and (3) use each subgrant to acquire and apply technology to identify individual student learning needs and support personalized learning. Allows LEAs that receive funds for both programs to use all the funds for systemic school redesign through technology integration program activities. Creates a new subpart 2 (State Competitive Grants) program to which all funding is to be directed if part D appropriations fall below a specified amount; otherwise all funding is to be made available for subpart 1 programs.

(The Impact Aid program compensates LEAs for the financial burden of federal activities affecting their school districts.) Calculates the value of the federal property located within the boundaries of an LEA by calculating the valuation, for property tax purposes, of all property within the LEA's boundaries and then multiplying that value by the proportion of that property that is federal property. Alters the formula for determining the foundation payments due LEAs for federal ownership of property when appropriations for a fiscal year are insufficient to provide them with full compensation.

(Sec. 8004) Provides Impact Aid construction payment eligibility to heavily impacted LEAs that are receiving basic support payments for federally-connected students, but not the support payments available to heavily impacted LEAs. (Sec. 8006) Directs the Secretary to complete Impact Aid payments to eligible LEAs within three fiscal years of their appropriation. (Sec. 8007) Includes the Coast Guard in the definition of "Armed Forces" for purposes of the Impact Aid program.

Includes school nurses as specialized instructional support personnel. (Sec. 9102) Allows students who are threatened by, or the victim of, a criminal offense at their public school to attend a safe public school within the LEA's jurisdiction. (Currently, this unsafe school choice option is available only to students attending schools identified as persistently dangerous or those who become victims of a criminal offense at their public school.) (Sec. 9103) Authorizes the Secretary to reserve for evaluation activities up to 3% of the amount appropriated to carry out each categorical program and demonstration project authorized by the ESEA, but prohibits the Secretary from reserving more than 1% of the funds appropriated to carry out title I for such activities.
