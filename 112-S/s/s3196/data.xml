  <summary>5/17/2012--Introduced.
National Women's High-Growth Business Bipartisan Task Force Act of 2012 - Establishes the National Women's High-Growth Business Bipartisan Task Force to provide women-owned, start-up and high-growth business advice, research, and policy recommendations to the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Assistant Administrator of the SBA's Office of Women's Business Ownership, Congress, the President, and other federal departments and agencies. Directs the Task Force, among other things, to review, monitor, and advise on plans and programs developed in the public and private sectors that affect the ability of small businesses owned and controlled by women to obtain capital and credit and to access markets. Requires the Task Force to report annually to the President and the congressional small business committees on the activities of the Task Force. Directs the SBA's Chief Counsel to: (1) semiannually conduct a study of an issue of importance to small businesses owned and controlled by women, and (2) submit each study's results to the Task Force and the small business committees. Amends the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 to repeal provisions establishing the Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise.</summary>
