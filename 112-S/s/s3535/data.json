Directs the Secretary, in determining whether to award a grant, to apply performance-based criteria, which shall give priority to applications based on: (1) the cost-effectiveness of the energy-efficiency improvement; and (2) an effective plan for evaluation, measurement, and verification of energy savings. Limits each grant award to: (1) an amount equal to 50% of the energy-efficiency improvement, and (2) $200,000. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY2013-FY2016 and makes offsetting reductions in authorizations for energy sustainability and efficiency grants under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act."
