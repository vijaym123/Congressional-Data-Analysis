Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) issue a revised safety assessment for food containers composed of bisphenol A, taking into consideration different types of such containers and the use of such containers with respect to different foods; and (2) determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to bisphenol A through food containers or other items composed of bisphenol A, taking into consideration potential adverse effects from low dose exposure and the effects of exposure on vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, infants, children, the elderly, and populations with high exposure to bisphenol A."
