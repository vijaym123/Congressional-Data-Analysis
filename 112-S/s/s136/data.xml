  <summary>1/25/2011--Introduced.
Ban Poisonous Additives Act of 2011 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem to be adulterated: (1) food intended for children three years of age or younger if the container is composed of bisphenol A; (2) a baby bottle or cup that is intended for use by children three years of age or younger, that does not contain a food when such bottle or cup is sold or distributed at retail, and that is composed of bisphenol A; and (3) infant formula if the container (excluding packaging on the outside of a container that does not come into contact with infant formula powder) is composed of bisphenol A. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) issue a revised safety assessment for food containers composed of bisphenol A, taking into consideration different types of such containers and the use of such containers with respect to different foods; and (2) determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to bisphenol A through food containers or other items composed of bisphenol A, taking into consideration potential adverse effects from low dose exposure and the effects of exposure on vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, infants, children, the elderly, and populations with high exposure to bisphenol A.</summary>
