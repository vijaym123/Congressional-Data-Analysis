  <summary>11/14/2012--Introduced.
Breast Cancer Patient Education Act of 2012 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide for the planning and implementation of an education campaign to inform breast cancer patients anticipating surgery regarding the availability and coverage of breast reconstruction, prostheses, and other options. Requires such campaign to include dissemination of the following information: (1) breast reconstruction is possible at the time of breast cancer surgery or in a delayed fashion; (2) prostheses or breast forms may be available; (3) federal law mandates that both public and private health plans include coverage of breast reconstruction and prostheses; (4) the patient has a right to choose the provider of reconstructive care, including the potential transfer of care to a surgeon that provides breast reconstructive care; and (5) the patient may opt to undergo breast reconstruction in a delayed fashion for personal reasons or after completion of all other breast cancer treatments. Prohibits such campaign from specifying, or being designed to serve as a tool to limit, the health care providers available to patients.</summary>
