  <summary>5/18/2011--Introduced.
Limits the amount that may be expended by the Department of Defense (DOD) in any fiscal year for printing and reproduction costs after FY2011. Rescinds a specified amount from amounts made available for the DOD for FY2011. Allocates such rescinded amounts across Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Army National Guard, Air National Guard, and defense-wide operation and maintenance accounts. Requires the Secretary of DOD to report to Congress on the allocation of such rescission. Requires certain DOD reports that are required by law that do not contain information that should not be made available to the public in the interest of national security to be distributed electronically in order to reduce printing and reproduction costs.</summary>
