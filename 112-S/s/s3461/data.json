Authorizes the Director of the Institute to award cooperative agreements and grants to public or private nonprofit entities for: (1) planning, establishing, or strengthening pediatric research consortia; and (2) providing basic operating support for such consortia, including for pediatric research needs and training. Authorizes the Director to make awards for not more than 20 pediatric research consortia. Requires the Director to provide for the coordination of activities among the consortia and to require the periodic preparation and submission of reports on their activities. Requires the Director of NIH to ensure that an appropriate number of such awards are awarded to consortia that agree to: (1) focus primarily on pediatric rare diseases or conditions; (2) conduct or coordinate multi-site clinical trials of therapies for, or approaches to, the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of pediatric rare diseases or conditions; and (3) disseminate trial findings. Requires the Director of NIH to establish a data coordinating center to: (1) distribute such findings; (2) provide assistance in the design and conduct of collaborative research projects and the management, analysis, and storage of data associated with such projects; (3) organize and conduct multi-site monitoring activities; (4) provide assistance to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the establishment of patient registries; and (5) report regularly on consortia research."
