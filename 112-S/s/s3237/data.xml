  <summary>5/24/2012--Introduced.
Accelerating the End of Breast Cancer Act of 2012 - Establishes the Commission to Accelerate the End of Breast Cancer to help end breast cancer by January 1, 2020. Directs the Commission to: (1) identify opportunities and ideas within the public and private sectors, basic and applied sciences, and epidemiology that can be turned into real world strategies to prevent breast cancer and breast cancer metastasis; (2) recommend projects to leverage such opportunities and ideas in the areas of the primary prevention of breast cancer and the causes and prevention of breast cancer metastasis; (3) promote ideas that are intellectually compelling and innovative; (4) accelerate potentially transformational scientific advances that are not being prioritized within the federal government and that are unlikely to be achieved by the private sector; (5) identify promising but underdeveloped areas of research that would benefit from a cluster of support from government, industry, and academia to rapidly advance knowledge into practices; (6) create opportunities for transdisciplinary, cross-cutting collaborations; (7) submit its strategic vision within six months after its initial members are appointed; and (8) ensure that its activities are coordinated with, and do not duplicate the efforts of, programs and laboratories of other government agencies. Directs the President to enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine for an evaluation of the Commission's progress. Establishes the Accelerating the End of Breast Cancer Fund to carry out this Act. Terminates the Commission on June 1, 2020.</summary>
