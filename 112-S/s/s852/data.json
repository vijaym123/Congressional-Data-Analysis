Exempts an employer filing a petition to employ such a worker from the requirement to show that the position is of a seasonal or temporary nature. Provides for a three-year initial period of admission with additional three-year extensions. Authorizes such alien to petition to become a lawful permanent resident after having worked as a sheepherder, goat herder, or dairy worker in the United States for not fewer than 33 of the preceding 36 months."
