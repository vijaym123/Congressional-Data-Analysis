Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to establish a pilot program under which the Secretary conducts case studies of states and metropolitan planning organizations that are designed to: (1) provide more detailed, in-depth analysis and data collection regarding transportation programs; and (2) apply rigorous methods of measuring and addressing the effectiveness of pilot program participants in achieving national transportation goals. Requires states and metropolitan planning organizations participating in the program to work cooperatively with the Secretary to: (1) evaluate the methods and metrics they use in measuring their effectiveness in achieving national transportation goals, and (2) identify steps to improve those methods and metrics. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to program participants to assist them in these efforts. Directs the Secretary, within 21 months of this Act's enactment, to analyze the pilot program case studies and develop and implement a plan for the DOT to use outcome-oriented performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of transportation programs in achieving national transportation goals.</summary>
