  <summary>7/19/2012--Introduced.
Government Transparency and Recordkeeping Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make available to Congress and the public all records of individual payments made since January 1, 2003, from a permanent appropriation of funds (commonly referred to as the Judgment Fund) available to the federal government to pay certain final judgments, awards, and compromise settlements (including appropriate attorney's fees, interest, and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act [EAJA]) resulting from claims against the United States. Requires the publicly available records to be updated annually to include payments made during the previous year. Requires such records, including a payment breakdowns showing the specific amount of the damages, interest, and attorneys' fees, to be maintained on a publicly accessible Internet website. Prohibits records from being made available under this Act if: (1) the payment was not the result of any executive branch, federal agency, or instrumentality statutory or regulatory approval or permit related case, court order, consent decree, or settlement; or (2) the disclosure of the information is otherwise prohibited by law or court order, or is not in the best interest of national security.</summary>
