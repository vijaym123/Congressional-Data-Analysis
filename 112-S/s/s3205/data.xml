  <summary>5/17/2012--Introduced.
Expatriation Prevention by Abolishing Tax-Related Incentives for Offshore Tenancy or the Ex-PATRIOT Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a 30% tax and withholding on capital gains income realized by a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for periods aggregating 183 days or more or an expatriate who has renounced his or her U.S. citizenship for tax avoidance purposes (specified expatriate). Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) render a specified expatriate inadmissible to the United States, and (2) prohibit any waiver of such inadmissibility. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security (DHS), to develop a policy for granting a waiver of inadmissibility to a specified expatriate who satisfies a tax liability related to such expatriate's renunciation of of U.S. citizenship.</summary>
