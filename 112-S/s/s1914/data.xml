  <summary>11/18/2011--Introduced.
Cut Energy Bills at Home Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individual taxpayers a tax credit for the cost of a qualified whole home energy efficiency retrofit for the purpose of reducing the energy use of the taxpayer's principal residence.&#160; Limits the amount of such credit to the lesser of $5,000 or 30% of the qualified home energy efficiency expenditures paid&#160;by the taxpayer to reduce&#160;residential energy use.&#160;Sets forth requirements for a qualified whole home energy efficiency retrofit, including design, testing, and documentation requirements. Terminates such credit after 2016. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a review process for home energy efficiency retrofits, including an estimate of usage of the tax credit and an analysis of the average actual energy use reductions.</summary>
