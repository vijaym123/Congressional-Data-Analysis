Defines \"Class I recall' as a food recall classification that covers a health-hazard situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of the food or food product being recalled will cause a serious, adverse health consequence or death. Amends the Poultry Products Inspection Act to consider a poultry product adulterated if it is contaminated with Salmonella or Campylobacter. Amends the the Federal Meat Inspection Act to consider any carcass, part thereof, meat, or meat food product adulterated if it is contaminated with Salmonella, Toxoplasma gondii, or enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) Shiga toxin-producing serotypes of Escherichia coli (E. coli) Requires that specified slaughterhouses, processing establishments, and grinding facilities perform specified tests for the presence of E. coli in ground beef. Subjects imported trim, bench trim, and ground beef to the same testing requirements as domestic trim, bench trim, and ground beef. Requires domestic facilities to conduct secondary testing of such meat before processing into a final ground beef product. Requires the Secretary, through the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), to redesign FSIS E. coli sampling and verification programs."
