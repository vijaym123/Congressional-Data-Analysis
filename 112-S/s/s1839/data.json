Requires a member requesting an early release from such active duty to be released within 14 days after such request. Allows such request to be denied only for medical or personal safety reasons. Allows the Secretary of the military department concerned to provide each member so retained (and, as practicable, appropriate family members) reintegration counseling and services."
