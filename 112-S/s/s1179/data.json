    "text": "Advanced Programs Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Education to allot grants to states, based on their share of low-income elementary and secondary school students, to cover part or all of the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) examination fee low-income students incur. Directs the Secretary to award competitive matching grants to states, local educational agencies (LEAs), or partnerships between a nonprofit organization and a state or LEA for activities that increase: (1) the number of qualified teachers at high-need schools who are teaching AP or IB courses; and (2) the number of students at high-need schools who enroll in, and pass the examination for, such courses. Gives priority, in awarding the competitive grants, to applicants that: (1) have a statewide or districtwide strategy for increasing the availability of AP or IB courses, and pre-AP or pre-IB courses, in high-need schools; (2) focus on increasing AP or IB courses in English, mathematics, and science; and (3) target schools with high concentrations of low-income students."
