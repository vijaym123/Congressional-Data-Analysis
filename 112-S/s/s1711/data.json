Requires the withdrawal of such a modification in specified circumstances until the USTR makes such a certification to Congress. Directs the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) to assess and identify the tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and practices for such products that exist in the foreign country as well as expected opportunities for U.S. exports to such country if such barriers and policies and practices are eliminated."
