    "text": "Michael Pohle Jr. Campus Emergency Alert Act - Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise the civil penalties applicable to institutions of higher education (IHEs) that fail to properly disclose campus security policies and crime statistics to current students and employees and, upon request, to any applicant for enrollment or employment. Sets a maximum penalty per violation and a limitation on the total amount an IHE can be penalized each year. Establishes a minimum penalty for each instance an IHE: (1) substantially misrepresents the number, location, or nature of the crimes it is required to report; (2) fails to notify the campus community of a significant emergency or dangerous situation that is an immediate threat to its health or safety, unless notice would compromise efforts to contain it; or (3) fails to provide the campus community with timely reports on crimes that are considered to be a threat to students and employees and are reported to campus security or the local police. Expresses maximum and minimum penalty amounts as percentages of the funds an IHE received from the Department of Education in the previous award year. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a special account in the Treasury where these penalties are to be collected and from which they are to be disbursed for activities promoting campus safety."
