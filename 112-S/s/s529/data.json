Amends the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 to require the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from the Treasury to the Pima Cotton Trust Fund amounts equal to the duties received in the Treasury from certain imported woven fabrics of cotton since January 1, 2004. Extends the authority of: (1) the Secretary to make transfers to the Trust Fund for certain annual distributions (duty refunds) to nationally-recognized associations promoting U.S. pima cotton use in textile and apparel goods, yarn spinners of U.S. pima cotton, and U.S. manufacturers who certify by affidavit to have used such imported cotton in the manufacture of cotton shirts, and (2) the Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to make such annual distributions. Requires annual affidavits from shirting manufacturers and from yarn spinners."
