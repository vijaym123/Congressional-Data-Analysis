Requires states, at a minimum, to cooperate with affected nonmetropolitan local officials responsible for transportation through regional transportation planning organizations to develop and implement long-range statewide transportation plans and statewide transportation improvement programs, with emphasis on addressing the transportation needs of nonmetropolitan areas of the state. Defines a regional transportation planning organization as a multi-jurisdictional organization composed of nonmetropolitan local officials (or their designees) and representatives of local transportation systems who all volunteer for such organization.</summary>
