Requires the FCC to compile a list of geographic areas that are not served by any provider of advanced telecommunications capability. Repeals and consolidates various FCC reports including reports on satellite competition, international broadband, video programming, cable industry prices, small business entry barriers, commercial mobile radio, and several other existing reports under such Act."
