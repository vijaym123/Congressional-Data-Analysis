Buy Fairly Trade Goods Act of 2012 - Directs the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to: (1) prohibit executive agencies from procuring imported merchandise subject to an antidumping or countervailing duty order, and (2) require that the terms of a contract or other agreement entered into between an agency and energy provider prohibit the provider from use of such merchandise in the performance of the contract or agreement. Allows the President to waive such requirement if it is in the U.S. national security interests. Requires the Council to ensure that such amendments are consistent with U.S. obligations under any international agreements.</summary>
