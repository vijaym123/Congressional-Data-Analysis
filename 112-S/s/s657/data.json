Sets forth the duties of the national coordinator, including: (1) providing assistance to states and local governments that are using Blue Alert plans; (2) establishing voluntary guidelines for states and local governments to use in developing such plans; (3) developing protocols for efforts to apprehend suspects that address activities during the period between the initial notification of a law enforcement agency that a suspect has not been apprehended and the time of apprehension of the suspect, or when the law enforcement agency involved determines that the Blue Alert is no longer effective; (4) working with states to ensure appropriate regional coordination of various elements of the network; (5) establishing an advisory group to assist states, local governments, law enforcement agencies, and other entities in initiating, facilitating, and promoting Blue Alert plans; (6) acting as the nationwide point of contact for the development of the network and regional coordination of Blue Alerts; and (7) determining which procedures and practices for notifying law enforcement and the public when a law enforcement officer is killed or seriously injured are effective and do not require the expenditure of additional resources to implement. Prohibits the national coordinator from: (1) lobbying any officer of a state regarding the funding or implementation of a Blue Alert plan, or (2) hosting a conference focused solely on the Blue Alert program that requires the expenditure of federal funds. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act to: (1) authorize public safety and community policing grants to be used to assist states in developing and enhancing programs and activities in support of a Blue Alert plan and communications network, and (2) authorize appropriations for such purpose."
