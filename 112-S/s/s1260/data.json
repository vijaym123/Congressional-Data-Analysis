Requires student borrowers to receive at least four hours of counseling on each occasion. Makes such counseling requirements inapplicable to borrowers of consolidation loans. Requires financial literacy counseling to include information on the Financial Education Core Competencies as determined by the Financial Literacy and Education Commission. Directs the Secretary of Education to develop a curriculum that IHEs may use to fulfill this Act's requirements."
