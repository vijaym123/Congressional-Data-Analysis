Requires such recaptured budget authority or funds, as well as any budget authority or cash recaptured and not rescinded or remitted to the Treasury, to be used by state housing finance agencies or local governments or local housing agencies with HUD-approved projects for which settlement occurred after January 1, 1992. Authorizes the Secretary of HUD (Secretary in this title), all the same, to award up to 15% of the budget authority or cash recaptured and not rescinded or remitted to the Treasury to provide project owners with incentives to refinance their projects at a lower interest rate. (Sec. 202) Prohibits the use of funds during FY2013 to investigate or prosecute under the Fair Housing Act any otherwise lawful activity engaged in by one or more persons, including the filing or maintaining of a non-frivolous legal action, that is engaged in solely to achieve or prevent action by a government official or entity, or a court of competent jurisdiction. (Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to make a grant under certain authority of the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act for any state that received an allocation in a prior fiscal year, but is not otherwise eligible for an FY2013 allocation because the areas in the state outside of qualifying metropolitan statistical areas in FY2013 do not have the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) otherwise required. Prescribes a formula for the allocation of such grants to Jersey City and Paterson, New Jersey. Requires the Secretary to: (1) adjust the funds allocated for FY2013 under the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act to Wilmington, Delaware, on behalf of the Wilmington, Delaware-Maryland-New Jersey Metropolitan Division; and (2) allocate a portion to the state of New Jersey according to a specified formula.

(Sec. 207) Authorizes any HUD corporations and agencies subject to the Government Corporation Control Act to make expenditures, contracts, and commitments without regard to fiscal year limitations as necessary to carry out their FY2013 budgets. (Sec. 208) Directs the Secretary to report quarterly to the congressional appropriations committees regarding all uncommitted, unobligated, recaptured, and excess funds in each program and activity within HUD jurisdiction, along with additional, updated budget information upon request. (Sec. 209) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to require PHAs to establish a flat rental amount for a PHA dwelling unit at levels no lower than 80% of the applicable fair market rental established under the Act. Directs PHAs to comply by September 30, 2013, with such requirement, except that if a new flat rate amount for a dwelling unit will increase a family's existing rental payment by more than 35%, the new flat rental amount shall be phased in to ensure that the family's existing rental payment does not increase by more than 35% annually. States that this requirement shall not be construed to require establishment of rental amounts equal to 80% of the fair market rental in years when it falls from the prior year. (Sec. 210) Requires the President's formal budget request for FY2014 and HUD's congressional budget justifications to use the identical account and subaccount structure provided under this Act. (Sec. 211) Declares that a public housing agency (PHA), or other entity, that administers federal housing assistance for the Housing Authority of the county of Los Angeles, California, or the states of Alaska, Iowa, or Mississippi shall not be required to include a resident of public housing or a recipient of section 8 rental assistance (under the United States Housing Act of 1937) on the agency or entity governing board. Requires each such PHA (or other entity) that chooses not to include such individuals on its governing board to establish an advisory board, which shall meet at least quarterly, consisting of at least six residents of public housing or section 8 rental assistance recipients. (Sec. 212) Authorizes the Secretary for FY2013-FY2014, subject to specified conditions, to authorize the transfer of some or all project-based assistance, debt, and statutorily required low-income and very low-income use restrictions, associated with one or more multifamily housing project, to another multifamily housing project or projects. (Sec. 213) Requires that the funds made available for Native American Housing Block Grants in title III of this Act be allocated to the same recipients that received funds in FY2005. (Sec. 214) Prohibits the use of funds provided under this title for an audit of Ginnie Mae that applies certain requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. (Sec. 215) Prohibits any section 8 rental assistance to any individual who: (1) is enrolled as a student at an institution of higher education; (2) is under age 24; (3) is not a veteran; (4) is unmarried; (5) does not have a dependent child; (6) is not a person with disabilities, and was not receiving section 8 assistance as of November 30, 2005; and (7) is not otherwise individually eligible, or has parents who, individually or jointly, are not eligible, to receive such assistance. Declares that, for section 8 rental assistance eligibility purposes, any financial assistance (in excess of amounts received for tuition) that an individual receives under the Higher Education Act of 1965, from private sources, or an institution of higher education shall be considered income to that individual, except for a person over age 23 with dependent children. (Sec. 216) Authorizes the Secretary through FY2013 to insure, and enter into commitments to insure, home equity conversion mortgages (HECMs, or reverse mortgages) for elderly homeowners. (Sec. 217) Requires the Secretary during FY2013, in managing and disposing of any multifamily property that is owned or has a mortgage held by HUD, and during the process of foreclosure on any property with a contract for section 8 rental assistance payments or other federal programs, to maintain any rental assistance payments attached to any dwelling units in the property. Authorizes the Secretary, however, to the extent that such a multifamily property is not feasible for continued payments, based on specified cost, operation, or environmental considerations, to: (1) contract, in consultation with the property's tenants, for project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties; or (2) provide other rental assistance. (Sec. 218) States that, during FY2013, a family residing in an assisted living facility in any county of Michigan with a section 8 rental assistance demonstration program, and on behalf of which a PHA provides such assistance, may be required, when the family initially receives the assistance, to pay rent in an amount exceeding 40% of the family's monthly adjusted income by any percentage or amount the Secretary determines appropriate. (Sec. 219) Requires the Secretary to report quarterly to congressional appropriations committees on HUD use of all sole source contracts. (Sec. 220) Authorizes any recipient after December 26, 2000, of a grant for conversion of elderly housing to assisted living facilities to: (1) establish a single-asset nonprofit entity to own the project; and (2) lend the grant funds to such entity, which may be a for-profit limited partnership the sole general partner of which is a private nonprofit organization meeting specified requirements, or a corporation wholly owned and controlled by such a private nonprofit organization. (Sec. 221) Authorizes the use of Community Development Loan Guarantee funds in FY2013 to guarantee, or make commitments to guarantee, notes or other obligations issued by any state on behalf of its non-entitlement communities. (Sec. 222) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to extend through FY2013 the authorization of appropriations for demolition, site revitalization, replacement housing, and tenant-based assistance project grants to PHAs. (Sec. 223) Authorizes PHAs that own and operate 400 or fewer public housing units to elect to be exempt from any asset management requirements imposed by the Secretary in connection with the operating fund rule. Prohibits exemption from such requirements, however, for an agency seeking a discontinuance of a reduction of subsidy under the operating fund formula. (Sec. 224) Prohibits the Secretary, with respect to the use of funds for the operation, capital improvement, and management of public housing authorized by the United States Housing Act of 1937, from imposing any asset management requirement or guideline that restricts or limits in any way the use of capital funds for central office costs. Prohibits a PHA, however, from using capital funds authorized for eligible operation and management activities with operating funds in excess of specified permitted amounts. (Sec. 225) Prohibits designation of a HUD official or employee as an allotment holder unless he or she has: (1) implemented an adequate system of funds control, and (2) received training in funds control procedures and directives. (Sec. 226) Requires the Secretary to take specified actions when a multifamily housing project with a section 8 contract or contract for similar project-based assistance: (1) receives a Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) score of 30 or less; or (2) receives a REAC score between 31 and 59 and fails to certify in writing to HUD, within 60 days, that all deficiencies have been corrected, or receives consecutive scores of less than 60 on REAC inspections. Applies such requirements to insured and noninsured projects with section 8 rental assistance attached to the units; but not to units receiving PHA project-based assistance under the voucher program, or to public housing units assisted with capital or operating funds. (Sec. 227) Requires payment of attorney fees in program-related litigation from individual program office personnel benefits and compensation funding. (Sec. 228) Requires the Secretary for FY2013 and thereafter to notify the public through the Federal Register and other appropriate means of the issuance of a notice of the availability of assistance or notice of funding availability (NOFA) for any program or discretionary fund that is to be awarded competitively. Authorizes the Secretary for such period to make the NOFA available only on the Internet at the appropriate government website or through other electronic media. (Sec. 229) Changes from quarterly to annual the reports to congressional appropriations committees on all steps taken to prevent fraud and abuse of Community Development Funds, especially in the form of duplication of benefits. (Sec. 231) Considers the HUD-administered Disaster Housing Assistance Programs as a HUD program under the McKinney Act for income verification and matching purposes. (Sec. 232) Allows up to $10 million out of funds appropriated for salaries and expenses under all accounts under this title (except for the Office of Inspector General account) to be transferred to and merged with amounts appropriated for the Working Capital Fund account. (Sec. 233) Amends the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 to repeal the mandatory transfer to the Flexible Subsidy Fund of all uncommitted balances in the Rental Housing Assistance Fund of certain excess rental charges as of September 30, 2007, as well as any collections made during FY2008 and all subsequent fiscal years. (Sec. 234) Amends the National Housing Act to extend through July 31, 2016, the exemption that authorizes the Secretary to provide mortgage insurance to critical access hospitals. (Sec. 235) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to redefine to treat as a PHA, for purposes of rental payments under the program of assisted low-income housing, a consortium of states, counties, municipalities, or other governmental entities or public bodies (or their agencies or instrumentalities) authorized to engage in or assist in the development or operation of public housing. (Sec. 236) Defines \"extremely low-income families,\" under the program of assisted low-income housing, as very low-income families whose incomes do not exceed the higher of: (1) specified poverty guidelines updated periodically by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); or (2) 30% of the median family income for the area, with adjustments for smaller and larger families. Authorizes the Secretary to establish income ceilings higher or lower than 30% if necessary because of unusually high or low family incomes. Revises income eligibility requirements for public housing, for tenant-based section 8 assistance, and for project-based section 8 assistance to substitute \"extremely low-income families\" for the respective eligibility formula. (Sec. 237) Revises requirements for PHA inspections of each dwelling unit for which a housing assistance payment contract is established. Requires biennial inspections, in lieu of current annual inspections, to determine compliance. Permits alternative inspection methods if specified standards are met. Requires interim inspections, upon family request, within 24 hours if a noncompliant condition is life-threatening, or within 15 days if not life-threatening. (Sec. 238) Amends the Department of Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, 2012 to terminate the authority of the Secretary to convert assisted units in the moderate rehabilitation program to tenant-based rental assistance or project-based rental assistance units. (Sec. 239) Amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to revise requirements with respect to termination of tenancy by an owner of affordable housing assisted under such Act for rental. States that the mandatory 30-day notice is not required if the grounds for the termination or refusal to renew a lease involve a direct threat to the safety of the tenants or employees of the housing, or an imminent and serious threat to the property (and the termination or refusal to renew is in accordance with requirements of state or local law). Revises requirements regarding the recapture and reuse of funds set-aside for investment only in housing to be developed, sponsored, or owned by community housing development organizations. Requires the Secretary to deduct any such funds remaining uninvested for a 24-month period from the line of credit in the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund and reallocate them by a specified reallocation formula other than the current direct reallocation formula. Title III: Related Agencies - Makes appropriations for FY2013 to: (1) the Access Board, (2) the Federal Maritime Commission, (3) the Office of Inspector General for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), (4) the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), (5) the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, and (6) the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. Title IV: General Provisions (This Act) - Specifies certain uses and limits on or prohibitions against the use of funds appropriated by this Act. (Sec. 401) Requires any sums necessary for FY2013 pay raises for programs funded in this Act to be absorbed within the levels appropriated in this or previous appropriations Acts. (Sec. 402) Prohibits the use of funds for the planning or execution of any program to pay the expenses of, or otherwise compensate, nonfederal parties intervening in regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings funded in this Act.
