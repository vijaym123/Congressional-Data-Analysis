Establishes a Surcharge Fund, to be administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), into which such assessments shall be deposited and from which the Secretary shall make a competitive grant every three years to a private nonprofit organization to operate a national child abuse hotline, encourage reporting of child abuse, and conduct public education on child abuse. Requires unobligated funds to be transferred to the Crime Victims Fund."
