Requires the plan to be designed to solve problems in energy supply, transmission, and use (including associated environmental problems) in the immediate and short-term, medium-term, and long-term. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress, along with the annual budget proposal of the Department of Energy (DOE), a detailed description of an energy research, development, and demonstration program to implement the aspects of the comprehensive plan appropriate to the DOE. Establishes a National Energy Research Coordination Council within the DOE to coordinate the development and funding of energy research, development, and demonstration activities for all energy program agencies. Requires the Chairpersons of the Council to establish a consolidated budget proposal each fiscal year to implement the comprehensive plan for federal energy research, development, and demonstration programs. Requires the physical location of the Council to be separate and distinct from DOE headquarters."
