Expresses the sense of Congress that any effort by the President to provide funds to any United Nations (U.N.) agency that admits Palestine as a member state would be a violation of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 or the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991.</summary>
