Nuclear Power 2021 Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to instruct the Secretary of Energy to implement, through cooperative agreements with private sector partners, programs to: (1) develop a standard design for not less than two small modular reactors, at least one of which has a rated capacity of not more than 50 electrical megawatts; (2) obtain a design certification from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for each of the standard designs by January 1, 2018; (3) demonstrate the licensing of small modular reactors by developing applications for a combined license for each of the designs so certified, and obtaining a combined license from the NRC for each of the certified designs by January 1, 2021; and (4) carry out a program to obtain an early site permit for 1 or more small modular reactors. Requires the Secretary to select proposals for such cooperative agreements through the use of competitive procedures and an impartial review of their scientific and technical merit. Sets forth cost-share requirements under which the non-federal source must provide at least: (1) 50% of the cost of the development of each small modular reactor design and each early site permit, and (2) 75% of the cost of the licensing demonstration of each small modular reactor design.</summary>
