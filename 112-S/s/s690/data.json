Prohibits any modification of a mortgage under the Making Home Affordable Program, or with any funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), unless the servicer of the mortgage loan has determined, in accordance with standards and requirements established by the Secretary, that the mortgagor cannot afford to make payments under the terms of the existing mortgage loan. (Thus prohibits participation in such Program for borrowers who strategically default.) Requires the Secretary to revise the guidelines for HAMP to establish that the data collected by the Secretary from each mortgage servicer and lender participating in the Program is made public at the individual record level in a specified manner."
