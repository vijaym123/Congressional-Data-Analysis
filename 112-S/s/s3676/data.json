Requires such an agency to provide a detailed explanation certifying that the mission of the agency cannot be achieved by participation in the system. Requires the International Cooperative Administrative Support Services Executive Board to allow an agency to act as an alternative provider for administrative services at an overseas post in place of the system if the agency: (1) demonstratives that it can provide the administrative service more efficiently, and (2) agrees to provide the administrative service to all other International Cooperative Administrative Support Services customer agencies at the overseas post. Requires the Comptroller General (GAO) to submit a review of the system to specified congressional committees"
