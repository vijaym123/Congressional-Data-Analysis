Courts and Public Defender Service Act of 2011 - Amends the District of Columbia Official Code to require the chief judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to: (1) call biennial or, as under current law, annual judicial conferences; and (2) summon active magistrate judges to such conferences. Authorizes the chief judges of the District Superior Court and of the District Court of Appeals to toll or delay judicial proceedings in certain natural disaster or other emergency situations. Limits such toll or delay to 14 days, unless the chief judge determines, with the consent of the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration, that an emergency situation requires additional extensions. Authorizes the Executive Officer of the District of Columbia courts to enter into agreements to provide the Mayor of the District with equipment, supplies, and services and credit reimbursements received from the Mayor for them to the appropriation of the District of Columbia courts against which they were charged. Amends the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 to require the District of Columbia Public Defender Service, to the extent its Director considers appropriate, to provide representation for and hold harmless, or provide liability insurance for, any employee, member of the Board of Trustees, or officer of the Service for money damages arising out of any claim, proceeding, or case at law relating to the furnishing of representational, management, or related services while acting within the scope of that person's office or employment, including employment actions, injury, loss of liberty, property damage, loss of property, personal injury, or death arising from the officer's or employee's malpractice or negligence. Reduces from five to three years the term an individual may be assigned to serve as a judge of the Family Court of the Superior Court."
