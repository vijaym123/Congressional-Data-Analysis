  <summary>2/9/2012--Introduced.
Extended Unemployment Benefits Reform Act of 2012 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code (relating to approval of state unemployment compensation [UC] laws) to prohibit state payment of extended UC to an individual, even under a temporary program, for any week in which he or she does not: (1) perform at least 20 hours of unpaid public service to a charitable organization, except in specified circumstances; and (2) engage in at least 20 hours of active job searching. Authorizes a state to reduce the required 20 hours of active job searching, and prescribe alternative job search requirements, for any individual who has met both the public service and active job searching requirements for at least 12 weeks.</summary>
