  <summary>10/20/2011--Introduced.
Center to Advance, Monitor, and Preserve University Security Safety Act of 2011 or CAMPUS Safety Act of 2011 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Director of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services to establish and operate a National Center for Campus Public Safety. Tasks the Center with strengthening the safety and security of institutions of higher education (IHEs) by: (1) training IHE public safety agencies and their collaborative partners; (2) fostering relevant research; (3) collecting, coordinating, and disseminating information and best practices regarding campus safety; (4) developing protocols to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from natural and man-made emergencies that threaten the campus community; and (5) increasing cooperation between IHEs and the law enforcement, mental health, and other agencies and jurisdictions that serve them. Authorizes the Director to award grants to IHEs and other nonprofit organizations for activities that will assist the Center in performing its functions. Transfers the Office of Dispute Resolution in the Department of Justice to the Office of Legal Policy. Directs the Attorney General to save $1 million by consolidating ineffective or duplicative programs through FY2016.</summary>
