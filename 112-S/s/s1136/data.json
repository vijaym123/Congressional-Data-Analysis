    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) (the Secretary with respect to lands under their respective jurisdiction), for any film crew of five persons or fewer, to require a permit and assess an annual fee of $200 for commercial filming activities or similar projects on federal land and waterways administered by the Secretary. Makes such a permit valid for such activities or projects that occur in areas designated for public use during public hours on all federal land and waterways administered by the Secretary for a one-year period. Prohibits the Secretary, for persons holding such a permit, from assessing any fees in addition to the annual fee described above for commercial filming activities and similar projects that occur in those areas during those hours. Bars the Secretary from prohibiting, as a mechanized apparatus or under any other purposes, the use of cameras or related equipment used for commercial filming activities or similar projects in accordance with this Act on federal land and waterways administered by the Secretary. Requires a film crew of five persons or fewer that is subject to a permit issued under this Act to notify the applicable land management agency having jurisdiction over the federal land at least 48 hours before entering it. Allows an applicable land management agency to deny access to a film crew if: (1) there is a likelihood of resource damage that cannot be mitigated, (2) there would be an unreasonable disruption of the public use and enjoyment of the site, (3) the activity poses public health or safety risks, and (4) the filming includes the use of models or props that are not part of the land's natural or cultural resources or administrative facilities."
