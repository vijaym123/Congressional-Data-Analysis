Revises the requirement that an employer give 60-day written notice to employees, state dislocated worker units, and local governments before ordering a plant closing or mass layoff. Requires such notice to include information stating whether: (1) the employer plans to continue producing goods or providing services that affected employees have been producing or providing, and (2) the production or provision will be performed for the employer by employees or contractors outside the United States (offshoring)."
