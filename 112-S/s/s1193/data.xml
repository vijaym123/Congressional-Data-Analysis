  <summary>6/14/2011--Introduced.
Federal-Aid Highway Preservation and Renewal Program Act of 2011 - Replaces the current Interstate (Highway System) maintenance program with a new surface transportation infrastructure preservation and renewal program. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to establish such a program to: (1) establish national priorities and goals for bringing federal-aid highways and federal-aid and non-federal-aid bridges into a state of good repair, (2) focus federal investment on preserving and improving roadway and bridge conditions, and (3) strengthen the connection between the use by a state of federal surface transportation funding. Authorizes a state to use apportioned program funds for eligible highway infrastructure improvement projects and costs. Requires a state to give priority to eligible projects that help meet certain state of good repair performance standards and targets for the National Highway System (NHS). Requires a state to: (1) develop an asset management process to support the development of system preservation and renewal plans for each class of infrastructure on NHS and federal-aid highways, and (2) develop and update such plans biennially for approval by the Secretary. Requires each state to develop a safe streets policy that ensures that the safety and convenience of all users of a transportation system are accommodated in all phases of project planning and development.</summary>
