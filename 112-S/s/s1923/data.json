Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit using the mail, any interactive computer service, telecommunications device, electronic communication service or system of interstate commerce, or any other facility of interstate or foreign commerce to intentionally disclose information, including a picture or other personally identifiable information, of another individual with intent to facilitate: (1) specified criminal offenses involving sexual abuse, sexual exploitation or abuse of children, domestic abuse, or stalking; or (2) any conduct that would qualify as a domestic assault if the conduct were directly committed by such person, if that individual has a final conviction on not less than two separate prior occasions for offenses that would be, if subject to federal jurisdiction, an assault, sexual abuse, or serious violent felony against a spouse or intimate partner or an offense of sexual exploitation or other abuse of children. Sets forth penalties for violations."
