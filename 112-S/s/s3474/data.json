    "text": "Protecting Students from Worthless Degrees Act - Makes any institution of higher education (IHE) postsecondary program designed to prepare students for a recognized occupation or profession requiring licensing or other entry pre-conditions ineligible to participate in a federal financial assistance program, unless it meets specified student consumer protection requirements. Requires each program to: (1) fully prepare students to satisfy those entry pre-conditions in the state in which the program is operated and in any state the program claims a successful program graduate will be prepared to work in the particular occupation or profession involved; (2) provide timely placement of students in required pre-licensure positions, such as internships or apprenticeships; and (3) meet specialized state accreditation requirements, or notify students if the program has not yet been fully accredited. Requires an IHE to notify out-of-state applicants as to whether or not its program satisfies the requirements of the applicant's state."
