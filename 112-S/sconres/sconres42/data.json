Permits the Chairman to make such adjustments only for points of order in this legislation relating to: (1) pay-as-you-go, and (2) long- and short-term deficits. Requires Senate committees to: (1) review programs and tax expenditures in their jurisdictions to identify waste, fraud, and abuse or duplication, and to increase the use of performance data to inform committee work; (2) review the matters for congressional consideration identified on the Government Accountability Office (GAO) High Risk list report; and (3) make recommendations to the Senate Budget Committee to improve governmental performance in their annual views and estimates reports. Rescinds any unobligated or unspent adjustments of allocations and aggregates made pursuant to this resolution after 36 months.
