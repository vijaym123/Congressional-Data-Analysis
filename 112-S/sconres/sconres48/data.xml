  <summary>6/12/2012--Introduced.
Recognizes: (1) the critical importance of the Operational Reserve as a component of the Armed Forces, particularly as a means of preserving combat power during a time of budget austerity; and (2) the dual-status, state-federal National Guard as the foundation of the Operational Reserve and of military manpower. Expresses support for making the Operational Reserve permanent. Repudiates proposals to return the Reserve Components to a diminished or purely strategic role in national security. Affirms the growth of the Operational Reserve as circumstances warrant.</summary>
