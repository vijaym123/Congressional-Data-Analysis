Honors the service and memory of: (1) the 121 sailors who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country while serving onboard the Enterprise, including the 30 that were killed in action during the Vietnam War; and (2) the 20 Enterprise sailors who were held as prisoners of war during the Vietnam War, the 3 who died while in captivity, and the 5 still listed as missing-in-action. Congratulates the nearly 100,000 current and former sailors who have served on the Enterprise and thanks them for their selfless sacrifice in service to the United States."
