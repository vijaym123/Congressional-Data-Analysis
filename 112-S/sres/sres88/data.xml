  <summary>3/3/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the federal government should preserve the organizational options available for businesses to operate as they choose, including as flow-through entities; (2) raising taxes on businesses that create jobs will be detrimental to the U.S. economic recovery; (3) generating increased tax revenue on the backs of U.S. small businesses will impede job creation; and (4) any legislative approach to comprehensive fundamental tax reform should include a debate on the individual rates at which most businesses in the United States should be taxed, rather than narrowly focusing on corporate tax rates or forcing small business owners into corporate status for tax purposes.</summary>
