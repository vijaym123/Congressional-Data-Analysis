Urges President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton, and Secretary of the Treasury Geithner to take measures to encourage the restoration of constitutional rule in Nicaragua. Notes the issuance of a final report on the Mission of Electoral Accompaniment of the Organization of American States (OAS). Urges: (1) the OAS to issue a report on constitutional irregularities impacting the pre-electoral phase in Nicaragua, and (2) the U.S. Ambassador to the OAS to work with other member states to strengthen the OAS's ability to protect democratic institutions."
