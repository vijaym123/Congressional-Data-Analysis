  <summary>7/29/2011--Passed Senate without amendment.
Affirms that it is U.S. policy to support the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Georgia and to recognize the areas of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as regions of Georgia occupied by the Russian Federation. Calls upon the government of Russia to fulfill the 2008 ceasefire agreements between Georgia and Russia. Urges the government of Russia and the authorities in control in the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to allow for the return of internally-displaced persons and international missions to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Supports constructive engagement and confidence-building measures between the government of Georgia and the authorities in control in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Affirms that finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict is a U.S. priority in the Caucasus region and that regional stability can only be achieved through peaceful means and long-term diplomatic and political dialogue.</summary>
