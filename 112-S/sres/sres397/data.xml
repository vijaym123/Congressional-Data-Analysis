Welcomes the memorandum of understanding on non-aggression and cooperation signed in Addis Ababa between Sudan and South Sudan on February 12, 2012. Calls on Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North to reach a political agreement and allow food and supplies to reach affected civilians. Urges Sudan to allow humanitarian access to all conflict-affected areas of Sudan. Implores the governments of Sudan and South Sudan to refrain from supporting proxy forces. Supports efforts of the Obama Administration, working with partners in the international community, to: (1) facilitate humanitarian access to affected areas, and (2) encourage parties to return to the negotiation table to reach agreements associated with the conclusion of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.</summary>
