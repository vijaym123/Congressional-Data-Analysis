  <summary>3/29/2012--Introduced.
Expresses support for designating April 2012 as National Autism Awareness Month. Commends individuals living with autism and their relatives for their sacrifice and dedication in providing for the special needs of autistic individuals. Recognizes: (1) that autism is a major public health crisis; (2) that meeting the needs of autistic individuals is a compelling public policy issue that requires a rapid national response; (3) that individuals and families are desperate to access services that presently are inadequate; (4) the need to begin early intervention services soon after a child has been diagnosed with autism; (5) the importance of assistance in the areas of comprehensive early intervention, health, recreation, job training, employment, housing, transportation, and early, primary, and secondary education; (6) that with access to such assistance and support autistic individuals can live productive lives; (7) that services for transitioning autistic youth and adults are an especially pressing need; and (8) that by providing adequate service and support at crucial points in life, autistic adults can become taxpaying citizens with productive and rewarding lives.</summary>
