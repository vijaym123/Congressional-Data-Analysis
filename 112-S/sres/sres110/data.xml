Permits waiver or suspension of this rule, or successful appeals from rulings of the Chair, only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the subcommittee or committee.

Amends Rule XVII (Reference to Committees; Motions to Discharge; Report; Hearings Available) to apply the same rule in the Senate before it proceeds to any legislative matter, including any matter hotlined. States that nothing in this resolution or any amendment made by it shall be interpreted to require or permit the declassification or posting on the Internet of classified information in the Senate's custody. Requires such classified information to be made available to Members in a timely manner as appropriate under existing laws and rules.</summary>
