  <summary>2/6/2012--Passed Senate without amendment.
Mourns the loss of lives as a result of the January 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti. Honors the service of U.S. government, embassy, and military personnel and members of international organizations who continue to serve Haiti and the Haitian people. Reaffirms the Senate's solidarity with the people of Haiti and its commitment to Haiti's long-term reconstruction. Encourages the U.S. government, the government of Haiti, and international donors to: (1) give priority to policies that would attract private sector investment and diaspora participation; (2) develop participatory mechanisms to involve civil society in Haiti at all stages of the cholera and post-earthquake responses; and (3) give priority to programs that would protect and involve vulnerable populations, including internally displaced persons, children, and persons with disabilities.</summary>
