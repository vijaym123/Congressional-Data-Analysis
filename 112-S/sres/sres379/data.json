Expresses solidarity with the people of Syria, who have exhibited courage and determination to rid themselves of a brutal dictatorship. Expresses disappointment with the governments of the Russian Federation and China for their veto of the U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Bashar al-Assad and the violence in Syria and urges them to reconsider their votes. Encourages Security Council members to pursue a resolution supporting a political solution to the Syrian crisis. Commends the League of Arab States' efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution in Syria. Regrets that the League's observer mission was not able to monitor the full implementation of the League of Arab States' Action Plan of November 2, 2011, due to the escalating violence in Syria. Urges the international community to review legal processes available to hold Syrian government officials accountable for crimes against humanity and violations of human rights."
