Remembers the tragedy that took place on April 10, 2010, when an aircraft carrying a delegation of current and former Polish officials, family members, and others crashed en route from Warsaw to Smolensk to memorialize the 1940 Katyn massacres, killing all 96 passengers. Honors the memories of all Poles executed by the Soviet secret police (NKVD) at Katyn, Miednoye, Khakriv, and elsewhere and those who perished in the April 2010 crash. Expresses sympathy for the family members of those who perished in the crash. Recognizes the resilience of Poland's constitution as demonstrated by the stable transfer of constitutional authority that occurred after the crash.</summary>
