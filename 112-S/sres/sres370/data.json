Maintains that Bashar al-Assad has lost all claims to legitimacy and calls upon him to step down from power. Condemns the governments of the Russian Federation and the Islamic Republic of Iran for providing military and security equipment to the government of Syria which has been used to repress peaceful demonstrations. Commends the League of Arab States' efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution in Syria and regrets that the League's observer mission was unable to monitor the full implementation of the League's Action Plan. Commends President Obama for authorizing targeted sanctions on human rights abusers in Syria. Urges President Obama to: (1) support a transition to democracy in Syria; (2) develop a plan to identify weapons stockpiles and prevent their proliferation in Syria; and (3) engage with Turkey, League members, and the European Union (EU) to protect the Syrian people. Urges the Department of State to: (1) establish a Friends of the Syrian People Contact Group of countries committed to democratic change in Syria, and (2) develop a strategy to encourage defections from the Syrian military. Urges the international community to support a post-Assad democratic and inclusive government of Syria that holds accountable those responsible for crimes against humanity and violations of human rights."
