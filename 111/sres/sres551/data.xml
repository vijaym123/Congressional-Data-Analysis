  <summary>6/14/2010--Passed Senate without amendment.
Marks one year since the flawed June 12, 2009, presidential election in Iran, and honors Iranian citizens who have lost their lives in peaceful protest since the election. Supports the people of Iran as they seek peaceful and free expression, free speech, free press, free assembly, unfettered access to the Internet, and freedom of religion despite a campaign of intimidation, repressions, and violence perpetrated by the government of Iran. Commends the people of Iran who have braved the persistent and pervasive threat of censorship, arrest, physical harassment, and death to have their voices heard and peacefully exercise fundamental human rights, as enshrined in the constitution of Iran and international human rights law. Condemns the government of Iran for perpetrating ongoing human rights abuses and for restricting, monitoring, and suppressing freedom of the press, expression, assembly, speech, and religion, as well as free access to the Internet and other forms of connective technology. Denounces the atmosphere of impunity for those who intimidate, harass, and commit violence against Iranian citizens, and calls for the unconditional release of all political and religious prisoners in Iran. Urges the President and Secretary of State to mobilize resources to support freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech in Iran, especially on the June 12 anniversary of the 2009 presidential election. Encourages the President and Secretary of State to work with the United Nations (U.N.) Human Rights Council to condemn the ongoing human rights violations perpetrated by the government of Iran and establish a mechanism by which the Council can monitor such violations. Urges the government of Iran to cooperate with and allow visits of the U.N. Special Rapporteurs for Human Rights and the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Urges the President and Secretary of State to work with the international community to ensure that violations of human rights are part of all formal and informal multilateral or bilateral discussions with and regarding Iran. Calls for the immediate return of all missing and detained U.S. citizens in Iran.</summary>
