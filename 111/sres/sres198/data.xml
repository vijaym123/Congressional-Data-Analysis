  <summary>6/19/2009--Passed Senate without amendment.
Recognizes the historical significance to the nation, and supports the continued celebration, of Juneteenth Independence Day (June 19, 1865, the day Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved African-Americans were free). Encourages the people of the United States to observe Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the celebration of the end of slavery is an important and enriching part of the history and heritage of the United States; and (2) history should be regarded as a means for understanding the past and solving the challenges of the future.</summary>
