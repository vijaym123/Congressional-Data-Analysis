Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should pursue opportunities for international cooperation in technology deployment and should act to ensure that any treaty or other accord resulting from negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of May 9, 1992, or a successor agreement does not weaken or undermine international legal rules and obligations relating to the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights for energy and environmental technology.</summary>
