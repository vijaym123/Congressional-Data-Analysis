  <summary>9/24/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Senate that: (1) enactment of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) served to create the modern generic pharmaceutical industry, which has provided consumers with access to affordable drugs, yielding significant health and economic benefits for the nation's health care system; (2) Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Henry Waxman deserve the nation's gratitude for authoring and championing this landmark bipartisan legislation; and (3) Congress should enact legislation to create a pathway for approval by the Food and Drug Administration of safe and affordable generic versions of biologic medicines.</summary>
