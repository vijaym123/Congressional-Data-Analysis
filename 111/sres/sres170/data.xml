  <summary>6/8/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) Congress should ensure that reform of our nation's health care system shall benefit all children and that no child shall be worse off; (2) strengthening our nation's Medicaid program should be a priority; and (3) low-income children should not be moved into a system that could diminish their benefits, cost-sharing protections, availability of care standards, and access to supports, services, and safety-net providers.</summary>
