  <summary>6/18/2009--Passed Senate without amendment.
States that the Senate appreciates the efforts of those European countries that have enacted legislation for the restitution of, or compensation for, private, communal, and religious property confiscated during the Nazi or Communist eras. Calls on the President and the Secretary of State to engage in dialogue with leaders of countries that have not enacted such legislation to support such legislation's adoption. Welcomes the efforts of many post-Communist countries to address the status of confiscated properties and urges those countries to ensure that their restitution or compensation programs are implemented in a timely and non-discriminatory manner. Urges the governments of Poland and Lithuania and the governments of other European countries that have not already done so to enact legislation so that victims, and communities, of Nazi persecution whose private religious or communal property was confiscated by the Nazis and in turn seized by a Communist government are able to obtain restitution of, or compensation for, such property. Welcomes the decision by the government of the Czech Republic to host a June 2009 international conference to continue the work done at the 1998 Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets to address issues relating to: (1) restitution or compensation; (2) opening of archives and the work of historical commissions; and (3) social welfare issues of Holocaust survivors.</summary>
