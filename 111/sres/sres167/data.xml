  <summary>6/3/2009--Introduced.
Commends the people who have sacrificed their personal freedoms and, in the case of the people who demonstrated at Tiananmen Square in June 1989, sacrificed their lives and freedom to bring about democratic change in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Expresses sympathy for the families of those who were killed, wounded, or imprisoned due to their involvement in the peaceful protests in Tiananmen Square. Condemns the ongoing human rights abuses by the PRC. Calls on the Government of the PRC to: (1) release all Tiananmen Square prisoners; (2) allow freedom of speech; and (3) cease intimidation and imprisonment of religious monitories and those who disagree with PRC policies. Supports efforts by free speech activists in China and elsewhere. Urges the President to support peaceful advocates of free speech around the world.</summary>
