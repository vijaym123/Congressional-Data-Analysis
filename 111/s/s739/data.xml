  <summary>3/30/2009--Introduced.
Drywall Safety Act of 2009 - Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to: (1) study drywall that was imported from China from 2004 through 2007 and used in U.S. residences; and (2) initiate a proceeding on whether a consumer product safety standard regulating drywall materials is necessary. Requires the CPSC to: (1) designate drywall containing over 5% organic compounds by weight as a product with a product defect which constitutes a substantial product hazard; and (2) order manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of such drywall to cease distribution and notify all persons who handle such product to cease distribution. Requires that the order remain in effect until: (1) the CPSC publishes a determination that such a standard is not necessary; or (2) such a standard takes effect.</summary>
