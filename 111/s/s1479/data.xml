  <summary>7/21/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to permit the designation of a certain critical access hospital in Cass County, Minnesota, by exempting it from the requirement that it be certified by the state on or after January 1, 2006, as being a necessary provider of health care services to residents in the area. (Thus restores to Minnesota state authority to waive the application of the 35-mile rule.)</summary>
