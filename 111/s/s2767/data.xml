Emergency Port of Entry Personnel and Infrastructure Funding Act of 2009 - Amends the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 to allocate certain FY2010 appropriations to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to pay the salaries and related compensation for an additional 250 CBP officers and 25 associated support personnel who shall be devoted to new inspection lanes at new land ports of entry along the Southern border between the United States and Mexico. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to hire, train, and assign to duty, by the end of FY2013, an additional: (1) 2,500 full-time CBP officers to serve on all inspection lanes and enforcement teams at U.S. lands ports of entry on the Northern border between the United States and Canada and the same number of CBP officers for the same purposes on the Southern border; and (2) 350 full-time support staff for all U.S. ports of entry. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on DHS plans for placing sufficient CBP officers on outbound inspections and agriculture specialists at all Southern border land ports of entry, respectively. Authorizes the Secretary to make incentive payments of $5,000 to $10,000, during FY2010-FY2015, to recruit and retain qualified CBP port of entry officers. Directs the Secretary to: (1) equip each CBP officer with a secure two-way communication and satellite-enabled device that allows communication between ports of entry and inspection stations, and with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement entities; and (2) establish a grant program for the purchase of detection equipment at land ports of entry and mobile, hand-held, two-way communication and biometric devices for state and local law enforcement officers along the Southern border. Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) to allocate certain construction funds for infrastructure improvements, expansion, and new construction (or reimbursement for new construction costs incurred during FY2007-FY2009) of high-volume ports of entry in Texas, regardless of port ownership. Grants the CBP additional authority for port of entry construction along the Northern and Southern U.S. borders.</summary>
