Repeals provisions providing that, prior to July 1, 1986, the importation into or public distribution in the United States of copies of a protected work consisting preponderantly of nondramatic literary material that is in the English language is prohibited unless the portions consisting of such material have been manufactured in the United States or Canada, subject to specified conditions and exceptions. Provides that the distribution of a phonorecord prior to 1978 shall not constitute a publication of the musical, dramatic, or literary work embodied therein. (Current law refers only to musical works.) Subjects all regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty Judges to Librarian of Congress approval and judicial review. (Under current law all regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty Judges are subject to the approval of the Librarian of Congress, but not to judicial review.)"
