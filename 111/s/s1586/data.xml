  <summary>8/6/2009--Introduced.
Safety for Our Schoolchildren Act of 2009 - Requires states and local educational agencies (LEAs) to: (1) obtain an FBI background check on individuals prior to offering them employment as school employees; and (2) if the check identifies them as sexual predators, report their application to local law enforcement. Prohibits states or LEAs from hiring individuals as: (1) school employees if they have been convicted of a crime of violence or other felony; or (2) school bus drivers if they have been convicted of, or pled guilty to, drunk driving or a serious moving violation. Withholds funds available to states for planning and administration and to LEAs as subgrants under part A of title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, if they violate such prohibitions or fail to take such actions.</summary>
