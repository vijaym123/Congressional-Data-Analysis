    "text": "Protecting Adoption and Promoting Responsible Fatherhood Act of 2009 - Amends part B (Child and Family Services) of title IV of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an automated National Putative Father Registry. Limits disclosure of information in the Registry to: (1) a state unit responsible for administering the State Putative Father Registry established pursuant to this Act; and (2) any state agencies or entities involved in the placement of children for adoption. Directs the Secretary to establish a nationwide responsible fatherhood and putative father registry educational campaign designed to: (1) inform men about the National Putative Father Registry, the advantages of registering with a State Putative Father Registry, and the rights and responsibilities of putative fathers; and (2) inform women about the National Registry and its potential role in a pending or planned adoption or a termination of a putative father's rights. Directs the Secretary to make grants to assist eligible states in developing, establishing, and operating programs designed to: (1) improve the protection of the rights of responsible unwed fathers in legal proceedings involving a planned or pending adoption, the termination of a father's rights to a biological child, or the entry of a child into the state child welfare system; (2) improve the laws and regulations involving the pre-birth abandonment of a child by the biological father and abandonment of a child by the biological father subsequent to birth; (3) assist mothers in making responsible plans for their children's future; and (4) protect the privacy and safety of birth mothers and fathers. Requires the Secretary also to make grants to reimburse states for any costs incurred in meeting these requirements. Requires each state that desires to receive such a grant to: (1) develop and implement a state plan for promoting responsible fatherhood and permanency for children; and (2) provide assurances that it will establish or modify an existing automated State Putative Father Registry to meet the requirements of this Act. Requires a state to: (1) establish centers in various locations so that registration forms for the State Putative Father Registry are easily accessible to putative fathers; and (2) provide assurances that it has in effect or will enact a state law defining pre-birth abandonment and abandonment subsequent to birth, and allowing for implied consent to the child's adoption in the case of pre-birth abandonment or abandonment subsequent to birth."
