(Sec. 108) Directs the Secretary to establish and maintain an interactive Internet website that provides information on the benefits, resources, services, and opportunities available for veterans and their families and caregivers, including veterans' benefits provided through the VA and the Department of Labor, tax benefits, social security benefits, state and local resources, and small business assistance. Requires the website to: (1) consolidate, expand on, and improve information and links from other existing websites relating to such benefits, resources, services, and opportunities; and (2) integrate dynamic Internet features and virtual interface tools to provide a personalized, interactive, and user-centered Internet experience.
