Sets forth a maximum penalty for failure to report a reportable transaction and a minimum and maximum penalty for failure to report a listed transaction (a transaction specifically identified by the IRS as a tax avoidance transaction). Requires the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to report by June 1, 2010, and then annually, to Congress on penalties relating to abusive tax shelters and reportable transactions. Extends the penalty for tendering a bad check to the Internal Revenue Service to any commercially acceptable payment instrument (including electronic payments). Expands the continuous tax levy on payments to vendors for goods and services to include payments for all property, goods, or services."
