Requires the state to cover or reimburse the Secretary for reasonable costs incurred to make the conveyances. Bars the Secretary from seeking reimbursement for administrative overhead costs. Requires the state to agree: (1) that all net proceeds from any sale, exchange, or other disposition of the real property subject to deed restrictions be used by the state for the acquisition of lands or interests within or adjacent to units of Florida's forest and park systems; (2) to address and resolve boundary encroachments for the affected state forests; and (3) to indemnify and hold the United States harmless with regard to any boundary disputes related to any released parcel. Provides for an interchange of certain state lands and National Forest System lands in the Ocala and Apalachicola National Forests in Florida. Authorizes the Secretary to convey by sale or exchange tract W-1979 within Leon County, Florida."
