Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to increase maximum amounts of loans to state and local development companies for plant acquisition, construction, conversion, and expansion. Increases the maximum loan guarantee percentage under the 7(a) program, effective until October 3, 2011. Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to extend through such date the authority to extend increased loan guarantees to small business lenders and to eliminate certain loan fees. Authorizes the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), through such date, to make loans to small businesses located in an economic disaster area. Amends the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Administrator necessary amounts to carry out this Act."
