  <summary>1/6/2009--Introduced.
Returning Government to the American People Act - Declares that: (1) the Bush Administration should not rush into effect major new controversial regulations in its closing days; (2) the incoming Administration, working with the Congress, should review and, if appropriate, revise or reject such regulations; and (3) Congress should enact and the President should sign legislation necessary to ensure the new Administration has that opportunity.</summary>
