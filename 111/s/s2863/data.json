    "text": "Emergency Response Act of 2009 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to redefine \"major disaster\" as any natural disaster (including pandemics), act of terrorism, or other manmade disaster (under current law, any natural catastrophe) in any part of the United States that, in the determination of the President, causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance to supplement the efforts and resources of states, local governments, and disaster relief organizations. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to designate a representative to lead a working group with national organizations that represent state, local, and tribal government interests to prepare best practice recommendations for facilitating the flow of public health information to state fusion centers and the greater homeland security community."
