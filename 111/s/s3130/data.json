Makes this prohibition inapplicable if the Comptroller General determines by June 30, 2010, that such legislation has been enacted. Requires OPM to provide for a period of open enrollment for Members of Congress beginning on the earliest administratively feasible pay period following the date on which the Comptroller General reports such determination."
