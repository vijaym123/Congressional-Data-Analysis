Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) authorize the issuance of a redeemable voucher, with limitations, to the registered owner of an eligible high fuel consumption automobile for the purchase of a new or used fuel efficient automobile upon transfer of the eligible automobile title to a participating dealer, dismantler, or scrap recycling facility; (2) allow a dealer, dismantler, or scrap recycling facility to participate in the program if they agree to scrap the eligible high fuel consumption automobile, issue a voucher to its owner, and meet all applicable requirements; (3) require dealers to accept such vouchers as partial payment for the purchase of a new or used fuel efficient automobile; and (4) make payments to dealers who accepted vouchers between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2014. Authorizes the use of vouchers to acquire single-passenger transit fare credits. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations that allow operators of bus and rail public transit systems to redeem properly issued vouchers to offset the purchase price of annual transit passes or any other form of individual transit fare credit designated by the transit system operator. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act."
