  <summary>4/28/2010--Introduced.
Southern Border Security Assistance Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) providing financial assistance for law enforcement initiatives with our Mexican partners is important; and (2) Congress must provide, in addition to such assistance, immediate resources and equipment to state and local law enforcement entities that are currently responding to border violence and criminal activities on a daily basis. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to award border security assistance grants to law enforcement entities located in the Southern Border Region to address drug trafficking, smuggling, and border violence. Directs the President to appoint additional district judges for Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas.</summary>
