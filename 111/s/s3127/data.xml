  <summary>3/16/2010--Introduced.
Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to arrange for the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences to review, at least once every 10 years, the most recent nutrition science and make recommendations for changes in the supplemental foods available under the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC). Directs the Secretary to alter the supplemental foods available under such program so they reflect the Institute of Medicine's findings.</summary>
