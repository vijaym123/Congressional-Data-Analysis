Makes authorizations for FY2009-FY2012 for: (1) the Medallion Foundation Program in Alaska; and (2) the Alaska aviation safety project. Authorizes the use of airport improvement program grants received by Alaskan airports for on-the-job trainee positions to the same extent as such positions are authorized for federal-aid highway projects."
