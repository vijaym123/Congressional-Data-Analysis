Pick-Sloan Tribal Commission Act of 2010 - Establishes the Pick-Sloan Tribal Commission for Comprehensive Resolution to consult with Indian tribes affected by the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program and study: (1) the Program's impact on those tribes and federal measures taken to address that impact; (2) other proposed measures addressing that impact; (3) the results of any other studies regarding that impact and potential solutions, including any related studies conducted by the Joint Tribal Advisory Committee; and (4) comparisons involving other situations in which federal or federally licensed hydroelectric projects have resulted in the taking or occupation of Indian land and the compensation or other measures Indian tribes have been or are being provided in those situations. Authorizes the Commission also to study the Program's impact on lands owned by members of an affected Indian tribe on the reservation of such tribe. Lists the affected Indian tribes as: (1) the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe; (2) the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe; (3) the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe; (4) the Santee Sioux Tribe; (5) the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe; (6) the Three Affiliated Tribes; and (7) the Yankton Sioux Tribe. Requires the seven member Commission to include at least three members of federally recognized Indian tribes and at least: (1) one Indian law and policy expert; (2) one expert on the operation and history of federal water projects; (3) one environmental justice expert; (4) one economist; and (5) one authority on cultural preservation. Directs the Commission to: (1) maintain an information website beginning on the date of its first meeting; (2) hold at least three hearings; (3) develop a proposal that comprehensively resolves the Program's impact on, and provides for full and final compensation to, the affected Indian tribes; and (4) issue a report.</summary>
