(The date on the recorded deed is October 16, 2000.) Allows the Lytton Rancheria to conduct activities for class II gaming on the land taken into trust. Prohibits the Lytton Rancheria from expanding the exterior physical measurements of any facility on the Rancheria in use for class II gaming activities. States that, for class III gaming purposes, the land taken into trust shall be treated, for purposes of provisions relating to gaming on lands acquired in trust after October 17, 1988, as if the land was acquired on October 9, 2003, the date on which the Secretary took it into trust."
