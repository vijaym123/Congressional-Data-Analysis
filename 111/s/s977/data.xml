  <summary>5/5/2009--Introduced.
Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2009 - Amends federal veterans' benefits provisions with respect to former prisoners of war (POWs) to repeal the currently required 30-day minimum period of internment prior to the presumption of service connection for certain listed diseases, for purposes of the payment of veterans' disability compensation. Adds diabetes (type 2) to the listed diseases. Requires: (1) such presumption also with respect to any disease that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines warrants such presumption by reason of having a positive association with the experience of being a POW; and (2) the Secretary to make such a determination within 60 days after a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War that such presumption be established for a non-listed disease.</summary>
