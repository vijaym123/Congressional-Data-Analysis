  <summary>11/16/2009--Introduced.
Small Business Penalty Relief Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to limit the penalty for failure to disclose a reportable transaction (a transaction determined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as having a potential for tax avoidance or evasion) to 75% of the decrease in tax resulting from such transaction. Sets forth a maximum penalty for failure to report a reportable transaction and a minimum and maximum penalty for failure to report a listed transaction (a transaction specifically identified by the IRS as a tax avoidance transaction). Requires the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to report by June 1, 2010, and then annually, to Congress on penalties relating to tax shelters and reportable transactions.</summary>
