Provides for the distribution of solar and wind energy rental income collected by the Bureau of Land Management in specified percentages to: (1) certain states in which such income is derived; (2) the Renewable Energy Permit Processing Improvement Fund; and (3) the Solar Energy Land Reclamation, Restoration, and Mitigation Fund. Authorizes the Secretary to use amounts in such Funds for processing renewable energy permits and for reclaiming and restoring public land used for the production of solar energy. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to eliminate the five year limitation on the deposit and use of lease revenues under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970."
