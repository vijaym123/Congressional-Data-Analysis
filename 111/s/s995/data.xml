Renewable Energy Permitting Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish and carry out a pilot program in FY2009-FY2018 to improve federal renewable energy permit coordination.

Authorizes the Secretary to use amounts in such Funds for processing renewable energy permits and for reclaiming and restoring public land used for the production of solar energy.
