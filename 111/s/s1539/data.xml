  <summary>7/29/2009--Introduced.
Greenhouse Gas Observation and Analysis System Act - Directs the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a greenhouse gas observation and analysis system that will offer the resolution and widespread coverage required to verify reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gases. Requires the system to: (1) be an operational and scientifically robust greenhouse gas observation system that provides quantitative information about sources, sinks, and fluxes of greenhouse gases at relevant temporal and spatial scales; (2) be capable of differentiating between source and sink exchanges, identifying types of emissions, and tracking agricultural and other sinks; and (3) include sustained ground, sea, and air-based measurements, sustained space-based observations, measurements of tracer, carbon cycle monitoring and modeling, traceability to the International System of Units, and data assimilation and analysis. Directs the Administrator to develop and submit to specified congressional committees a plan for an integrated and comprehensive greenhouse gas observation and analysis system, which shall: (1) describe current greenhouse gas observation networks, modeling, and data analysis efforts; (2) contain an inventory of agency data relevant to greenhouse gases; (3) assess gaps, conflicts, and opportunities with respect to such efforts and data; (4) establish priorities, define agency roles, and make recommendations on necessary capacity and capabilities for measurements, monitoring, modeling, analysis, and data management; (5) establish mechanisms for ensuring continuity of greenhouse gas measurements; and (6) contribute to international efforts to build and operate a global greenhouse gas information system. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress every four years on the effectiveness of the system, progress in achieving plan objectives, the consistency of reported greenhouse gas emissions with independent observations, and changes in Earth-system sources and sinks of greenhouse gases.</summary>
