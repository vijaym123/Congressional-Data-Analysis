Prohibits an individual with a license, certificate of registry, or merchant mariners document and serving under the authority of such license, certificate, or document on a vessel that is required to have a vessel security plan from entering an area designated as a secure area in such a plan unless the individual has (or is accompanied by an individual who has) a biometric transportation security card issued by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. (Current law contains the same prohibition, but without referring to serving under the authority of such license, certificate, or document.) Removes a provision prohibiting an individual engaged on a towing vessel that pushes, pulls, or hauls alongside a tank vessel from entering a secured area without having (or without being accompanied by an individual who has) such a card."
