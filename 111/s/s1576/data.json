Directs the Secretary (subject to specified requirements) to provide to owners of eligible land financial incentive payments for: (1) eligible practices that measurably increase carbon sequestration and storage over a designated period, as specified through a climate mitigation contract; and (2) permanent avoided deforestation agreements (i.e., permanent conservation easements that cover eligible land that will not be converted for development). Directs the Secretary to: (1) specify requirements to address intentional or unintentional reversal of carbon sequestration during the contract period; (2) issue regulations that specify eligible practices and related compensation rates, standards, and guidelines; (3) establish and implement protocols that provide monitoring and verification of compliance with such contracts; (4) report on progress toward reaching specified levels of carbon sequestration and storage through such contracts; and (5) adjust (at least every two years) eligible practices and compensation rates for future contracts based on the results."
