  <summary>7/16/2009--Introduced.
Building Student Success Act of 2009 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to allot matching grants to states so each can fund: (1) a comprehensive effort by an experienced nonprofit or public entity to assist selected open enrollment institutions (community colleges or institutions of higher education that accept any student who applies for admission) in devising, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating strategies to improve their students' success; and (2) a rigorous, external evaluation of such effort. Allots grant funds to states on the basis of each state's share of residents who are enrolled in open enrollment institutions and residents aged 15 through 44 who are impoverished.</summary>
