    "text": "Secure Airport Terminal Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to prescribe regulations that: (1) require the use of security cameras at all screening locations and all locations where passengers exit the sterile area at airports in the United States; (2) prescribe requirements for the use, maintenance, and testing of such security cameras and other technological devices; and (3) specify that employees of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have access to all such security cameras and technological devices as well as data or recordings from them relating to airport security. (Under aviation security regulations: (1) \"screening location\" means each site at which individuals or property are inspected for the presence of weapons, explosives, or incendiaries; and (2) \"sterile area\" means a portion of an airport that provides passengers access to boarding aircraft and to which the access generally is controlled by TSA, or by an aircraft operator or a foreign air carrier, through the screening of persons and property.) Directs the DHS Assistant Secretary (TSA) to report to specified congressional committees: (1) recommendations for improving the security of each location at an airport where passengers exit the sterile area; and (2) an assessment of differences in location configurations and options for improving security at such locations. Prescribes a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for individuals who enter an aircraft or an airport area in violation of security requirements. Increases the criminal penalty of maximum imprisonment for such violations from one year to 10 years. Directs each U.S. airport operator that is required to establish an air transportation security program to ensure that signs meeting DHS requirements for providing notice of such penalties are displayed near all screening locations, all locations where passengers exit the sterile area, and other appropriate airport locations. Subjects an individual to such penalties, however, without regard to whether signs are displayed as required by this Act."
