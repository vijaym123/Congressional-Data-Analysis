Beef Checkoff Modernization Act of 2009 - Amends the Beef Research and Information Act to require a beef promotion and research order to provide that: (1) at least 30% of U.S. producer assessments be made available to promote and market products derived from cattle born and raised in the United States; and (2) an amount collected from importers shall be reserved to promote products derived from cattle not born and raised in the United States. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, beginning in 2010 and at least every seven years thereafter, upon receipt of a petition of a group comprising 10% or more of cattle producers, to conduct a referendum to: (1) determine whether cattle producers favor the termination or suspension of the order; and (2) vote on any other amendments to the order.</summary>
