Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish and carry out a program to coordinate and intensify prostate cancer research, including by: (1) carrying out research to develop advances in improved early detection, diagnostic, and prognostic methods and tests; (2) carrying out research to better understand the etiology of prostate cancer to improve prevention efforts; (3) expanding basic research into prostate cancer; and (4) establishing clinical registries for prostate cancer. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Defense (DOD), and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to incorporate prostate cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for medically underserved populations into the telehealth programs of their departments, including by: (1) giving priority to populations in medically underserved areas and in rural and highly rural areas; (2) promoting the efficient use of specialist care; and (3) more effectively employing tumor boards to better counsel patients. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to: (1) carry out a national education campaign to encourage men to seek prostate cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment when appropriate; and (2) award grants to private nonprofit organizations to test alternative outreach and education strategies."
