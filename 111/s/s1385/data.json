    "text": "Maritime Hazardous Cargo Security Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to promote the establishment within the International Maritime Organization of an international committee for the safe and secure handling and transportation of especially hazardous cargo to the United States. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and implement a voluntary program under which foreign ports and facilities can certify their compliance with International Ship and Port Facility Code (ISPFC) standards (including a program under which independent, third-party entities are certified to validate such ports' and facilities' compliance with such standards); and (2) establish a strategic plan (under current law, program) to utilize assistance programs to assist foreign ports and facilities that lack effective antiterrorism measures in implementing port security antiterrorism measures. Authorizes the Coast Guard (CG) to lend, lease, donate, or otherwise provide equipment and technical training and support to foreign ports and facilities to assist them in complying, and validating such compliance, with ISPFC standards. Directs the Secretary, acting through the CG Commandant, to: (1) initiate a national study to identify measures to improve the security of maritime transportation of liquefied natural gas and other especially hazardous cargoes; and (2) coordinate with other federal agencies, the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee, and appropriate state and local government officials through the Area Maritime Security Committees and other coordinating committees to evaluate, and provide a national strategy for, the waterside security of vessels carrying, and waterfront facilities handling, especially hazardous cargo. Includes the establishing of regional response and recovery protocols to prepare for, respond to, mitigate against, and recover from a transportation security incident in area maritime transportation security plans. Directs the Secretary to ensure that federal, state, and local personnel responsible for the safety and security of vessels in port carrying especially hazardous cargo complete Department of Homeland Security incident command system training. Directs the Secretary to ensure that interoperable communications technology is deployed at all interagency operational centers for port security located at high-priority ports."
