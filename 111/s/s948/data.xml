Agency Administrative Expenses Reduction Act of 2009 - Requires all executive branch agencies, excluding the District of Columbia government, to include a separate category for administrative expenses when submitting their appropriation requests to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for FY2010-FY2013. Directs each agency to submit a budget to OMB for administrative expenses that reflects a reduction from its FY2009 requests for such expenses of: (1) at least 3% for FY2010; (2) 6% for FY2011; (3) 9% for FY2012; and (4) 11% for FY2013. Requires the Director of OMB to review an agency's request for administrative expenses. Authorizes the Director to reduce such a request in the budget of any noncompliant agency to achieve the appropriate reduction.</summary>
