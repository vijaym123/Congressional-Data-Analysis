    "text": "Violence Against Children Act of 2010 - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or other assistance to state, local, or Indian tribal governments in the criminal investigation or prosecution of felonies against individuals under 18 years of age; and (2) award grants to develop and strengthen effective law enforcement and prosecution of crimes against children and to provide education, prevention, intervention, and victims' assistance services for such crimes. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to: (1) require states to use a certain percentage of funds received under such Act to improve their parole systems; and (2) allow the use of school security grants for the placement of surveillance equipment in schools and the establishment of hotlines or tiplines for reporting potentially dangerous students and situations. Establishes an interagency task force to develop advisory school safety guidelines. Requires states receiving grants under this Act to use the National Incident-Based Reporting System to report crimes against children. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop model training and caseload standards for child guardians in child abuse and neglect cases. Mynisha's Law - Authorizes a local government, city, county, tribal government, or a group of counties (located in one or more states) to apply to the Attorney General for designation as a High Intensity Gang Activity Area. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish criteria for reviewing such applications; and (2) establish an Interagency Gang Prevention Task Force to coordinate federal assistance to such Areas."
