Sets forth requirements for the administration of the wilderness areas, including with respect to the incorporation of acquired land and interests, domestic livestock grazing, access to non-federal land, state water laws, and tribal rights. Withdraws federal land within the wilderness areas from all forms of: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing or mineral materials. Authorizes certain land exchanges with specified landowners. Requires appraisals to be conducted of the federal and non-federal land to be exchanged."
