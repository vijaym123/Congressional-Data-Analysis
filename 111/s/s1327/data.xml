Public and Indian Housing Crime and Drug Elimination Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 - Amends the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Act of 1990 to rename it the Public and Indian Housing Crime and Drug Elimination Program Act. Limits activities for programs designed to reduce drug use in and around assisted low-income housing to: (1) providing access to drug abuse treatment through rehabilitation or relapse prevention; (2) providing education about the dangers and consequences of drug use or violent crime; (3) assisting drug use discontinuance through education or treatment programs; (4) providing after school youth activities; and (5) providing capital improvements and security services to discourage or eliminate drug use or violent crime. Requires grant application plans to: (1) be developed in coordination with relevant local law enforcement agencies and other local entities involved in crime prevention and reduction; and (2) include an agreement between the applicant and the Office of Policy Development and Research of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under which the applicant shall work cooperatively with the Office in carrying out technical assistance and program oversight under the Act. Requires: (1) the Office to review existing research relating to preventing violent and drug-related crime; and (2) the Secretary of HUD to publish a written report describing such results. Requires the Office to develop and implement a plan for evaluating the effectiveness of each specified strategy funded under the Act that has not previously been subject to a rigorous evaluation methodology. Reauthorizes the program through FY2014.</summary>
