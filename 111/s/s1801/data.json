Requires the preparation of a general management plan for the Park. Requires completion of a study regarding the preservation and interpretation of additional properties in Delaware that relate to the Park's purposes, including an assessment of: (1) the potential for designating them as National Historic Landmarks; and (2) options for maintaining their historic integrity."
