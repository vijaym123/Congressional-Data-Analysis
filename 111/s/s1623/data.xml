Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act - Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from authorizing any new lease for exploration or production of oil or natural gas unless the lessee: (1) certifies for each existing lease that the lessee has diligently developed the lands in order to produce oil or natural gas, or is producing oil or natural gas from such lands; or (2) has relinquished all federal oil and gas leases that are not being diligently developed. Instructs the Secretary to promulgate diligent development regulations that: (1) include benchmarks for oil and gas development to ensure that leaseholders produce oil and gas from each lease within the five-year original term of the lease; and (2) require each leaseholder to submit a diligent development plan showing how the lessee will meet the benchmarks. Establishes a civil penalty for noncompliance with this Act.</summary>
