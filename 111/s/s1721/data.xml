  <summary>9/25/2009--Introduced.
Transportation Low Emissions Energy Plan 2020 Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT), in coordination with the Secretary of Energy (DOE) and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to establish a stakeholder-driven process to develop a national transportation low emissions energy plan. Requires such plan to: (1) project the near- and long-term need for and location of electric drive vehicle refueling infrastructure at strategic locations across all major national highways, roads, and corridors; (2) identify infrastructure and standardization needs for electricity providers, infrastructure providers, vehicle manufacturers, and electricity purchasers; (3) establish a goal of achieving strategic deployment of electric vehicle infrastructure by 2020; (4) prioritize the development of standardized public charge access ports with wireless or smart card billing capability and level I and level II charge port systems (that charge an electric vehicle over a period of 8 to 14 hours and 4 to 8 hours, respectively) that will meet the energy requirements of the majority of plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles; (5) examine the feasibility of level III charge port systems that can charge over a period of 10 to 20 minutes; and (6) focus on infrastructure that provides consumers with the lowest cost while providing convenient charge system access. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) designate within DOT a LEEP coordinator to oversee Plan development and the implementation of regional pilot projects; and (2) establish four pilot projects to demonstrate electric drive vehicles and infrastructure in rural locations and in commercial use.</summary>
