Lumbee Recognition Act - Extends federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. Makes the Tribe and its members eligible for all services and benefits provided to Indians because of their status as members of a federally recognized tribe. Deems, for purposes of the delivery of such services, Tribe members residing in Robeson, Cumberland, Hoke, and Scotland counties in North Carolina to be residing on or near an Indian reservation. Allows land to be taken into trust for the Lumbee Tribe. Requires treating an application to take land located in Robeson County, North Carolina, into trust as an "on reservation" trust acquisition under regulations concerning land acquisitions. Prohibits the Tribe from conducting gaming activities as a matter of claimed inherent authority or under the authority of any federal law, including the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.</summary>
