    "text": "Arctic Climate Adaptation Act - Establishes in the Department of Commerce an American Arctic Adaptation Grant Program. Directs the Denali Commission to: (1) be the Alaska Project Coordinator for the Program; (2) select, administer, and coordinate projects awarded grants under the Program; (3) establish an Adaptation Advisory Committee to advise the Commission on climate adaptation needs and investments and on the award of grants under the Program; and (4) publish an annual work plan for the Program. Permits the Commission to combine funds from the Program with awards from other appropriate federal or state infrastructure development, construction, or maintenance programs to provide funds to carry out an eligible project. Defines \"eligible project\" as a project to repair, replace, or maintain an element of public infrastructure in a coastal or remote Alaskan village damaged or threatened by the effects of climate change. Requires the Commission, during FY2010 and in collaboration with the state of Alaska, the University of Alaska, and relevant U.S. agencies, to conduct research on best practices for climate related adaptation that are being used or researched by other polar nations or foreign or domestic research institutions or institutions of higher learning and that could be used by Arctic communities in Alaska."
