Requires the Director of CDC to prepare the National Pulmonary Fibrosis Education and Awareness Plan, which shall: (1) focus on strategies to increase public education and awareness of pulmonary fibrosis; (2) address the need for new physician education strategies to improve diagnosis and treatment standards; and (3) assess and monitor the costs of pulmonary fibrosis and its burden on patients and families.
