Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (National Center) to collect, analyze, and report data related to health workforce issues in coordination with the State and Regional Centers for Health Workforce Analysis; (2) award grants to, or enter into contracts with, states, state workforce commissions, and other health care entities to collect, analyze, and report to the National Center data on programs related to health workforce issues; and (3) increase the amount of grants or contracts awarded for the establishment and maintenance of a longitudinal tracking system (a system that tracks students, residents, fellows, interns, or faculty who have received education, training, or financial assistance from Health Professions Education and Training programs for at least five years). Requires the Advisory Committee on Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Linkages and the Advisory Council on Graduate Medical Education to develop, publish, and implement performance measures for health professions education programs."
