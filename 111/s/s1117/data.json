Authorizes the Secretary to provide the Commissions with financial and technical assistance to further the purposes of this Act. . Requires the Commissions to develop criteria to prioritize and determine the eligibility of applicants for assistance under the Program and to review and prioritize applications for such assistance. Requires such criteria to be submitted by the Commissions for review by the Secretary. Sets forth procedures for the approval or disapproval of the criteria. Allows the Commissions to use funds under this Act to provide financial and technical assistance to state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and other public and private entities for the protection of the watershed. Authorizes appropriations. Limits the federal share of the total cost of any activity funded by assistance under this Act to half of that activity's total cost. Permits the non-federal contribution towards such an activity to be in the form of in-kind contributions of fairly valued goods or services.
