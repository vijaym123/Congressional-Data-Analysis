Directs the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA) and in cooperation with the oyster industry and the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference, to conduct an education campaign to increase awareness of the risks associated with consuming raw oysters. Prohibits any proposed regulation or guidance issued by the Secretary that affects the harvesting, processing, or transportation of seafood harvested in the United States from becoming final or taking effect until the Secretary submits to the appropriate congressional committees a report that contains: (1) a cost-benefit analysis, economic impact study, and health impact analysis of such proposed regulation or guidance; and (2) an analysis that compares such proposed regulation or guidance to any similar regulations or guidance with respect to other regulated foods and that compares the risks associated with seafood and the instances of those risks in such other regulated foods."
