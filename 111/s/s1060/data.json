Includes community education programs designed to address and prevent overweight, obesity, and eating disorders as activities states may carry out under preventive health services and health services block grants. Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture to update and reform federal oversight of food and beverage labeling. Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to provide additional funding to make free fresh fruits and vegetables available in elementary schools.
