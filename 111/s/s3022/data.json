Requires that: (1) the list of such persons required by this Act be made available to the public and posted on the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State websites; and (2) the President consider data obtained by other countries and nongovernmental organizations that monitor Iran's human rights abuses in preparing such list. Authorizes the President to: (1) not apply such sanctions in order to permit U.S. compliance with the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations and other international agreements; and (2) waive such sanctions if in the U.S. national interest. Terminates sanctions upon presidential certification to Congress that the government of Iran has: (1) released all political prisoners; (2) ceased its practices of violence and abuse of Iranian citizens engaging in peaceful political activity; and (3) conducted a transparent investigation into the killings and abuse of peaceful political activists in Iran and prosecuted those responsible."
