    "text": "Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act Reauthorization of 2010 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and revise a research, training, and technical assistance resource center to prevent suicides. Expands the program's focus from youth suicides to suicides among all ages, particularly among groups that are at high risk for suicide. Reauthorizes a program of grants for the development of state or tribal youth suicide early intervention and prevention strategies. Reauthorizes and revises a grant program to enhance services for students with mental health or substance use disorders at institutions of higher education. Requires (current law authorizes) the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Director of the Center for Mental Health Services, to award grants to enhance such services and to develop best practices for the delivery of such services. Permits grant funds to be used for the provision of such services to students and to employ appropriately trained staff. Requires the Secretary to give special consideration to applications for grants that describe programs that demonstrate the greatest need for new or additional mental and substance use disorder services and the greatest potential for replication. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, to convene an interagency, public-private sector working group to plan, establish, and begin coordinating and evaluating a targeted public education campaign that is designed to focus on mental health and substance use disorders on college campuses. Requires the Secretary to establish a College Campus Task Force to discuss mental health and substance use disorder concerns on college and university campuses."
