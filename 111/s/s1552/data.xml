  <summary>7/30/2009--Introduced.
Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act of 2009 or the SOAR Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award five-year grants on a competitive basis to nonprofit organizations to carry out activities to provide expanded school choice opportunities to students who are DC residents and who come from households: (1) receiving assistance under the supplemental nutrition assistance program under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008; and (2) with incomes not exceeding 185% of the poverty line, except in certain grandfathered circumstances. Prescribes requirements for schools participating in such grant programs, including administering nationally norm-referenced standardized tests in reading and mathematics to participating students. Repeals the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 (title III of division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004). Deems this Act as the reauthorization of the opportunity scholarship program under such Act.</summary>
