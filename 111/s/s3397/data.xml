  <summary>10/12/2010--Public Law.
Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to allow an ultimate user of a controlled substance (or, if deceased, any person lawfully entitled to dispose of the ultimate user's property) who has lawfully obtained such substance to deliver that substance to another person, without being registered, for disposal if: (1) the person receiving the controlled substance is authorized to engage in such activity; and (2) the disposal takes place in accordance with regulations issued by the Attorney General to prevent diversion of controlled substances. Requires the Attorney General, in developing regulations under this Act, to consider the public health and safety, as well as the ease and cost of program implementation and participation by various communities. Permits the Attorney General to authorize long-term care facilities to dispose of controlled substances on behalf of ultimate users who reside, or have resided, at such facilities in a manner that will provide effective controls against diversion and that is consistent with public health and safety. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to review and, if appropriate, amend its guidelines and policy statements to ensure an appropriate penalty increase for persons convicted of a drug offense involving receipt of a controlled substance for disposal.</summary>
