Classified Information Procedures Reform Act of 2009 - Amends the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) to: (1) require courts to grant certain ex parte government requests for CIPA protective orders; (2) restrict access to classified information obtained from nondocumentary sources; and (3) allow interlocutory appeals from any order for access to classified information (currently, appeals lie only from orders entered under CIPA). Additional Government Weapons Against Terrorism Act of 2009 - Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) impose criminal penalties for providing material support or resources to a perpetrator of international terrorism, or to a family member of or other person associated with such perpetrator, with the intent to facilitate, reward, or encourage international terrorism; (2) prohibit attempts or conspiracies to provide material support or resources to terrorist organizations; (3) impose criminal penalties for the use of false travel documents; and (4) deny release to individuals detained pending sentencing or appeal who have been convicted of certain terrorism crimes or crimes against children."
