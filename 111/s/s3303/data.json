Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to make minor adjustments to the boundaries of the Monument to reflect the inclusion of significant archaeological resources discovered on adjacent National Forest System land. (Sec. 4) Sets forth provisions for the administration of the Monument. Permits only such uses of the Monument that would further the purposes specified above. Requires the Monument to be administered according to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and the policy specified in the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. Allows for continued use of the Monument by Indian tribes for traditional ceremonies and as a source of traditional plants and other materials. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out vegetative management treatments within the Monument, with the exception of timber harvesting which shall only be used when necessary for ecosystem restoration or the control of fire, insects, or diseases. Limits the use of motor vehicles and mountain bikes in the Monument to roads and trails identified as appropriate for such use. Permits grazing in the Monument where established prior to this Act's enactment. Prohibits anything in this Act precluding upgrading an existing utility right-of-way through the Monument. Authorizes the Secretary to construct an education and interpretive center to interpret the Monument's scientific and cultural resources for the public. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to develop a management plan for the Monument in consultation with Indian tribes having a cultural or historic tie to Chimney Rock. Requires an opportunity for public comment on the plan. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the Secretary to acquire, by purchase from willing sellers, donation, or exchange, land and interests within or adjacent to the Monument.
