Requires the Video Programming and Emergency Access Advisory Committee, in its report to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to: (1) identify additional protocols for the delivery of emergency information delivered by digital broadcast television (as well as by Internet protocol); and (2) recommend any regulations that may be necessary to ensure compatibility between video programming delivered using digital broadcast television (as well as using Internet protocol). Amends the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Twenty-first Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, to specify low-income individuals who are deaf-blind with respect to the requirement that the FCC establish rules defining the eligibility for relay service support of those FCC-approved programs for the distribution of specialized customer premises equipment designed to make telecommunications and related services accessible by individuals who are deaf-blind."
