  <summary>6/22/2010--Introduced.
Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to prohibit the Secretary of Commerce, for each of FY2011-FY2013, from: (1) providing a participant in the Hollings Manufacturing Partnership Program with more than 50% of the costs incurred by the participant under the Program; and (2) requiring a participant's cost share to exceed 50%. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on such cost share requirements, including: (1) an analysis of various cost share structures; and (2) a recommendation for structuring the cost share requirement after FY2013 to best provide for the Program's long-term sustainability.</summary>
