Requires the state SCHIP plan to specify how it will achieve coverage for 85% of eligible targeted low-income children in the state. Prohibits payment for child health assistance for a targeted low-income child in a family whose income exceeds 250% of the poverty line. Sets forth special rules for children with family income between 200% and 250% of the applicable poverty line. Applies Medicaid citizenship documentation requirements to SCHIP. Terminates SCHIP coverage for nonpregnant adults. Requires that individuals who are eligible for SCHIP and employer-sponsored coverage use the employer-sponsored coverage instead of SCHIP."
