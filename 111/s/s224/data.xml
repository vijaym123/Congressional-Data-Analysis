Green Jobs and Infrastructure Act of 2009 - Requires the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) to provide loans to manufacturers to help finance the cost of: (1) re-equipping, expanding, or establishing (including applicable engineering costs) a manufacturing facility in the United States to produce clean technology products and the significant component parts of those products; and (2) improving the energy efficiency of the industrial processes of the manufacturers other than through the production of products and component parts. Applies such loans to: (1) facilities and equipment placed in service before December 30, 2012; and (2) costs that were incurred from this Act's enactment to December 30, 2020. Requires the Secretary to: (1) implement a program to provide up to $50 billion in loans to eligible individuals and entities for such costs; and (2) give priority to those facilities that are located in regions with the highest unemployment rates. Authorizes the Secretary to provide awards or loans to facilities that are idle. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to: (1) increase from 30% to 80% the portion of the manufacturing facility and engineering integration costs to be awarded under the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program; (2) require the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer $1 billion to carry out such program; and (3) require the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer $10 billion on October 1 of 2009, 2010, and 2011 to carry out the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants program (specifies how such funds are to be allocated). Amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 to include a Clean Energy Service Corps program among the types of national service programs eligible for assistance under such Act.
