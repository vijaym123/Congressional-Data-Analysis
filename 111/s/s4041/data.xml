  <summary>12/17/2010--Introduced.
Prepaid Card Consumer Protection Act of 2010 - Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to extend its coverage to spending card accounts (prepaid cards) established by a consumer (or on a consumer's behalf): (1) to which recurring electronic fund transfers may be made, at the consumer's direction, and (2) from which payments may be made, at the consumer's direction, through the use of a card, code, or device. Treats as a spending card account any similar asset account operated or managed by a financial institution, or any other person, whose funds: (1) are pooled with the funds of a person other than the one who established the account, or (2) are held in a name other than that of the person who established the account. Excludes from the meaning of spending card account: (1) any nonreloadable general-use prepaid card in an amount under $250; and (2) any general-use prepaid card solely associated with a certain kind of health plan, a qualified transportation fringe, a health savings account or any other healthcare benefit account, a gift certificate, a store gift card, an electronic promise, plastic card, or payment code, or device, a nonreloadable card labeled as a gift card and marketed solely as such, or a nonreloadable loyalty, rebate, or promotional card. Requires a financial institution to offer electronic fund transfer services in connection with a spending card account only if the account is insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and complies with its pass-through deposit insurance requirements. Requires any person that accepts funds in connection with an electronic fund transfer to a spending card account to: (1) transfer them, within 24 hours after accepting them, to an account at an insured depository institution; or (2) credit the spending card account an amount equal to the amount of such funds. Waives the requirement for providing a consumer with a periodic statement if a financial institution, among other things, provides the consumer with access to the account balance through a readily available telephone line and the Internet and at an electronic terminal or other device (ATM machine) that allows the consumer to make a balance inquiry. Prohibits the charging of fees for services required to meet these requirements, other than $1 for an optional periodic statement. Specifies other fees which may and may not be charged in connection with a spending account card.</summary>
