    "text": "Access to Cancer Clinical Trials Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit a group health plan from: (1) denying an eligible participant or beneficiary with cancer participation in clinical trials related to the prevention or treatment of cancer that are federally funded or conducted under an investigational new drug application reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); (2) denying (or limiting or imposing additional conditions on) the coverage of routine patient costs for items and services furnished in connection with such participation; or (3) discriminating against an individual on the basis of such participation. Includes as routine patient costs all items and services provided in the clinical trial that are otherwise generally available to a qualified individual, with certain exceptions. Applies such prohibitions to coverage offered in the individual market and coverage offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Makes this Act effective January 1, 2009. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to study the impact on group health plans of requiring them to cover routine patient care costs for individuals with serious and life threatening diseases other than cancer."
