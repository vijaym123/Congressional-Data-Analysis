  <summary>8/5/2010--Introduced.
Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow a state to opt out of the renewable fuel standard, other than with respect to the applicable volume of advanced biofuel, cellulosic biofuel, or biomass-based diesel, upon state enactment of a law electing to opt out. Requires the Administrator, upon a state making such election, to: (1) reduce the applicable volume of renewable fuel by the percentage that reflects the national gasoline consumption attributable to the state; and (2) provide for the generation of credits for all gasoline provided through a fuel terminal in the state to be calculated as though the gasoline were blended with the maximum allowable ethanol content of gasoline to apply toward the applicable volume of renewable fuel.</summary>
