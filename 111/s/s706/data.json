Directs the Secretary to determine the functions of autism navigators, which may include: (1) case management and psychosocial assessment and care; (2) notifying individuals of autism clinical trials; (3) helping individuals overcome barriers in accessing and securing appropriate services in a timely manner; and (4) coordinating with relevant departments providing services to individuals with an autism spectrum disorder and their families. Requires a navigator program to provide centralized access for individuals with an autism spectrum disorder to multiple federal and state activities and programs related to autism spectrum disorders. Requires grantees to collect autism data and ensure confidentiality. Directs the Secretary to: (1) disseminate a standard curriculum for training first responders in assisting individuals with autism and other cognitive behavioral disabilities and their families during emergencies; and (2) award grants to states and local governments for such training. Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to provide for a program for adults with autism spectrum disorder with the goal of providing individualized housing and services."
