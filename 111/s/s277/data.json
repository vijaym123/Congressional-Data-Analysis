    "text": "Serve America Act - Amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (NCSA) and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA) to revise their programs and reauthorize appropriations for them through FY2014. Title I: Amendments to National and Community Service Act of 1990 - Revises under the NCSA: (1) the School-Based and Community-Based Service-Learning programs and Higher Education Innovative Programs for Community Service, also known as Learn and Serve programs; (2) National Service Trust programs, also known as AmeriCorps; (3) the Civilian Community Corps Demonstration program; and (4) the Investment for Quality and Innovation program. Subtitle A: Amendments to Subtitle A (General Provisions) - (Sec. 1101) Adds to NCSA purposes: (1) providing year-round opportunities in service-learning; (2) involving program participants in emergency and disaster preparedness, relief, and recovery; (3) increasing service opportunities for retiring professionals; (4) encouraging service by individuals age 55 or older and continued service by national service alumni; (5) focusing national service on the areas of national need such service has the capacity to address; (6) assisting social entrepreneurs and nonprofit community organizations in addressing national and local challenges; (7) leveraging federal investments to increase other public and private resources directed toward such challenges; and (8) supporting institutions of higher education (IHEs) that engage students in service-learning. (Sec. 1102) Adds definitions of Alaska Native-serving institutions, approved silver scholar positions, approved summer of service positions, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions, authorizing committees, community-based entities, disadvantaged youth, Hispanic-serving institutions, historically Black colleges or universities, medically underserved populations, Native American-serving, nontribal institutions, Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, predominantly Black Institutions, principles of scientific research, qualified organizations, scientifically valid research, territories, tribally controlled colleges or universities, and veterans. Subtitle B: Amendments to Subtitle B (Learn and Serve America) - (Sec. 1201) Revises the School-Based programs for elementary and secondary school students (part of the Learn and Serve programs) to eliminate the current competitive grant portion of such programs. Requires the Corporation for National and Community Service (Corporation) to allocate appropriated funds to states, after reserving from 2% to 3% for Indian tribes and territories, pursuant to a formula that takes into account a state's share of school age youth and funds received under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Sets a minimum grant of $75,000 per state for School-Based programs when fiscal year appropriations for the School-Based programs exceed $50 million. Authorizes grants to be used for the development of civic engagement programs dealing with our nation's history and government. Limits the Corporation's share of costs for new School-Based programs to 80% for their first year, 65% for their second year, and 50% thereafter. Permits certain schools receiving funds under ESEA title I to use such funds to cover their share of program costs. Eliminates the current Community-Based Learn and Serve programs. (Sec. 1202) Revises the Higher Education Innovative programs (part of the Learn and Serve programs) that award grants to IHEs and partnerships of IHEs and nonprofit organizations for the provision of community service-learning opportunities to postsecondary school students. Allows the use of grant funds for the inclusion of service-learning as a key component not only of preservice teacher education, but also of education in other fields, such as medicine, criminal justice, or public policy. Directs the Corporation, to the extent practicable, to give special consideration to applications submitted by, or partnerships that include, IHEs serving primarily low-income populations, including predominantly Black institutions, historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribally controlled colleges and universities, Native American-serving, nontribal institutions, Alaska Native-serving institutions, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions, Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, and community colleges serving predominantly minority populations. Requires that grantee IHEs meet the minimum requirement set by the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding the participation of federal work-study students in community service activities. Establishes a Campuses of Service program under which the Corporation annually designates up to 25 IHEs, from among institutions nominated by State Commissions on National and Community Service (State Commissions), as recipients of funding to develop exemplary service-learning programs or disseminate them to other IHEs. (Sec. 1203) Establishes a new Learn and Serve program, Innovative Community-Based Service-Learning Programs and Research, providing grants to states, nonprofit organizations, territories, Indian tribes, IHEs, elementary or secondary schools, and local educational agencies (LEAs) to: (1) provide community service-learning opportunities to elementary and secondary, college, and graduate students; and (2) research and evaluate service-learning.
