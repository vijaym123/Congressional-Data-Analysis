  <summary>12/17/2010--Reported to Senate amended.
American Communities' Right to Public Information Act - Amends the SAFE Port Act with respect to existing prohibitions against the disclosure of information contained in maritime transportation security plans (including facility security plans, vessel security plans, and port vulnerability assessments) and other information related to security plans, procedures, or programs for vessels or facilities. Declares that such prohibitions shall not be construed to authorize the designation of information as sensitive security information to: (1) conceal a violation of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; (2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; (3) restrain competition; or (4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of transportation security.</summary>
