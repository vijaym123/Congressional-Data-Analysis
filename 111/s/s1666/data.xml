  <summary>9/14/2009--Introduced.
Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow the introduction into commerce of a mid-level ethanol blend (an ethanol-gasoline blend containing greater than 10% ethanol) for use in conventional gasoline-powered onroad or nonroad vehicles and nonroad engines only if: (1) EPA's Science Advisory Board submits to the Administrator, and the Administrator provides for public notice and comment, a report describing the impact of the blend on such vehicles, emissions, and associated materials compatibility and consumer issues, the ability of the gasoline distribution infrastructure to introduce the blend without widespread misfueling by consumers, and the estimated ability of consumers to purchase gasoline other than that blend in in all areas of the United States by five years after the blend is introduced; (2) the permit or authorization is granted through the fuels and fuel additives waiver process under the Clean Air Act and the Administrator formally responds to the Board's recommendations in the waiver announcement; and (3) the blend is introduced for general use in all conventional gasoline-powered onroad and nonroad vehicles and nonroad engines in widespread use as of the date on which the Administrator authorizes that introduction.</summary>
