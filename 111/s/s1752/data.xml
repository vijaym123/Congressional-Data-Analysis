  <summary>10/5/2009--Introduced.
Adds Parkinson's disease (manifested to a degree of disability of 10% or more) to the list of diseases presumed to have been incurred in or aggravated by military service in Vietnam (and therefore compensable under veterans' disability compensation), notwithstanding that there is no evidence of the disease during the period of service, provided a veteran served between specified dates and was exposed to a herbicide used in military operations during that period.</summary>
