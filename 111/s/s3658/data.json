    "text": "Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to partnerships to: (1) provide high quality professional development to elementary school principals in early childhood education and development; (2) gain a knowledge base and capacity to provide high quality early childhood education; and (3) collaborate with early childhood education providers, services providers, and families in creating a continuum of high quality development and learning for children in the community and school settings. Requires each partnership to consist of: (1) a public or private entity experienced in training elementary school principals; (2) at least one public agency; and (3) at least one early childhood education organization that trains early childhood education providers. Requires grantees to conduct an ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of their grant-funded programs and activities. Directs the Secretary to establish a panel of leading experts in elementary and early childhood education to: (1) identify the best practices in professional development for elementary school principals in early childhood education; (2) review the effective coordination of such training among this Act's grantees; and (3) disseminate the latest research and findings regarding such training."
