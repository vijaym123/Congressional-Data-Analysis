Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as preventing or restricting any person from blocking any caller identification service. Requires a related report by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to Congress. Provides civil and criminal penalties for violations. Allows enforcement by states (with authorized intervention by the FCC). Declares that this Act does not prohibit any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of a law enforcement agency of the United States, a state, or a state's political subdivision, or of a U.S. intelligence agency."
