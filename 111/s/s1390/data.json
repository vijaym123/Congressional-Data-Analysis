Provides limitations with respect to decommissioning and the disposition of operational silos at Missile Fields 1 and 2 at Fort Greely, Alaska. (Sec. 246) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the U.S. government should continue developing and planning for the proposed deployment of elements of a GMD system in the Czech Republic and in Poland, consistent with the Hunter Act; (2) the United States should work with its NATO allies to explore options and architectures to provide missile defenses for Europe and the United States against current and future Iranian ballistic missile capabilities; (3) any alternative BMD system for Europe against such threat should be at least as capable as the proposed European deployment of the GMD system; and (4) any missile defense capabilities deployed in Europe should be interoperable with U.S. and NATO missile defense systems. Earmarks specified FY2009-FY2010 MDA funds for the RDT&E of a midcourse radar element of the GMD system in the Czech Republic and the proposed long-range missile defense interceptor site element of such system in Poland, as well as related RDT&E against Iranian ballistic missiles of all ranges.
