Requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to issue specified implementing rules governing covered loans. Declares unenforceable with respect to a consumer any contract made in violation of this Act. Declares that this Act neither preempts nor prevents state law from providing greater protection to consumers than is provided under this Act."
