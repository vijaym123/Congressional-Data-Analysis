San Francisco Bay Restoration Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide grants to state and local agencies, and public or nonprofit agencies, institutions, and organizations, for ecosystem restoration projects and habitat improvement for fish, waterfowl, and wildlife, in accordance with priorities described in the comprehensive conservation and management plan for the San Francisco estuary. Limits such a grant to 75% of the total cost of eligible activities to be carried out using grant funds. Requires the non-federal share of the total cost of activities carried out using funds to be no less than 25%. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2020.
