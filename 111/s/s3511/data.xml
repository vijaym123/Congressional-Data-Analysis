  <summary>6/18/2010--Introduced.
Promoting Electric Vehicles Act of 2010 - Establishes within the Department of Energy (DOE) a national plug-in electric drive vehicle deployment program. Directs the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) to: (1) provide, upon local request, technical assistance to state, local, and tribal governments with the deployment of plug-in electric drive vehicles; (2) make available to the public information regarding the cost, performance, usage data, and technical data regarding plug-in electric drive vehicles and associated infrastructure; (3) carry out a national assessment and develop a national plan for plug-in electric drive vehicle deployment; and (4) award grants to state, local, and tribal governments to assist them in preparing a community deployment plan, and in preparing and implementing programs that support the such deployment. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and publish model building codes for the inclusion of separate circuits for charging infrastructure in new construction and major renovations of private residences, buildings, or other structures; and (2) award grants to institutions to provide training and education for vocational workforce development to ensure skills needed to work on and maintain plug-in electric drive vehicles and the infrastructure required to support them. Directs the Federal Energy Management Program and the General Services Administration to assess and report to Congress on federal government fleets with respect to conversion to plug-in electric drive vehicles. Instructs the Administrator of General Services to acquire plug-in electric drive vehicles and the requisite charging infrastructure to be deployed in a range of locations in the federal fleet during a five-year period. Establishes within the national deployment program a targeted plug-in electric drive vehicle deployment communities program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a program to fund research and development in advanced batteries, plug-in electric drive vehicle components, plug-in electric drive infrastructure, and related technologies; (2) implement a study on recycling of materials from plug-in electric drive vehicles and their batteries; and (3) establish the Advanced Batteries for Tomorrow Prize for a 500-mile vehicle battery. Establishes in the Treasury the 500-mile Battery Fund. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study and report to Congress on: (1) the raw materials needed for the manufacture of components for plug-in electric drive vehicles; and (2) the infrastructure needed to support such vehicles. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to require each electric utility to develop a plan to support the use of plug-in electric drive vehicles in its service area. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to direct the Secretary of Energy to guarantee loans to eligible entities for the aggregate purchase of not fewer than 200 qualified automotive batteries (designed for use in qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles but purchased for nonautomotive applications) in a calendar year with a total minimum power rating of one megawatt and advanced battery technology. Establishes the Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Technical Advisory Committee. Directs the President to establish the Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Interagency Task Force.</summary>
