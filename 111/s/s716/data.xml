  <summary>3/26/2009--Introduced.
Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) with respect to a hospital which provides acute care services to ventilator-dependent patients who are: (1) entitled to benefits under Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance); and (2) eligible for medical assistance under a state plan approved under SSA title XIX (Medicaid). Revises ventilator-dependent patient days requirements for the disproportionate patient percentage in the formula for calculation of an additional Medicare payment for each subsection (d) hospital. (Generally, a subsection (d) hospital is an acute care hospital, particularly one that receives payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)</summary>
