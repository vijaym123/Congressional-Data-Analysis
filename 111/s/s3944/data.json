Requires that service performed by an incumbent law enforcement officer be treated: (1) for all purposes, as service performed as a law enforcement officer, irrespective of how such service is treated for retirement purposes; and (2) for retirement purposes, as service performed as such an officer, but only if an appropriate written election is submitted to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) five years after the enactment of this Act or before separation from government service, whichever is earlier."
