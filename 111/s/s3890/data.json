Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to include in a required report concerning such payments a plan describing DOD outreach and informational efforts to promote and increase awareness of the special pay. Provides funding for the outreach and informational efforts, with a funding limit of $10 million. Requires, in subsequent reports concerning the stop-loss payments, descriptions and assessments of the outreach and informational efforts."
