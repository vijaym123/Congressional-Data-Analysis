  <summary>12/4/2009--Introduced.
Child Welfare Workforce Improvement Act - Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to: (1) direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to study and report to the Secretary and Congress on child welfare staff; and (2) to direct the Secretary to treat as necessary for proper and efficient state administration all state expenditures for training the child welfare workforce. Allows funds from private nonprofit educational institutions to be considered as the state's share in claiming federal reimbursement for such expenditures, without regard to certain requirements. Establishes a competitive child welfare workforce improvement demonstration program to assist eligible entities in developing and implementing child welfare workforce improvement plans to help facilitate implementation of the essential components of an effective child welfare workforce, throughout the child welfare continuum, from preventing child abuse and neglect through ensuring and supporting permanent families for children, in order to meet the needs of the children and families served by that workforce. Requires an eligible entity to ensure that the responsible state agency establishes a Child Welfare Workforce Quality Improvement Task Force.</summary>
