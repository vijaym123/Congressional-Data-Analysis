Southern Nevada Higher Education Land Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey three parcels of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land to the Nevada System of Higher Education (the System) for the Great Basin College, the College of Southern Nevada, and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (the campuses). Allows conveyance of the federal land to be phased-in while remediation is completed. Authorizes the Board of Regents of the System to agree in writing to: (1) pay administrative costs associated with the conveyance, including the costs of any environmental , wildlife, cultural, or historical resources studies; (2) use the federal land for educational and recreational purposes; (3) release and indemnify the United States from any claims or liabilities that may arise from uses carried out on the federal land on or before enactment of this Act by the United States or any person; (4) erect at the campuses monuments that acknowledge the conveyance of the federal land for furthering the higher education of citizens in Nevada; and (5) assist BLM in providing information to students of the System and citizens of Nevada on public lands in the United States (including management of such land) and the role of BLM in managing, preserving, and protecting public lands in Nevada. Requires the federal land to be used according to the agreement entitled "Cooperative Interlocal Agreement between the Board of Regents of the Nevada System of Higher Education on Behalf of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the 99th Air Base Wing, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada," dated June 19, 2009. Prohibits the federal land from being used to compromise the national security mission or avigation rights of Nellis Air Force Base. Allows the System to use the federal land for educational or public purposes relating to the establishment, operation, growth, and maintenance of the System, including: (1) educational facilities; (2) housing for students, System employees, and educators; (3) student life and recreational facilities, public parks, and open space; (4) university and college medical and health facilities; (5) research facilities; and (6) any other public purpose that would be associated with an institution of higher education, consistent with the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. Permits the System: (1) to lease or otherwise provide property or space at the campuses to religious, public interest, community, or other groups for services and events of interest to the System or any community in southern Nevada; (2) to allow other communities in southern Nevada to use the campuses' facilities for educational and recreational programs; and (3) in conjunction with the city of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, or Pahrump or Clark or Nye County to plan, finance (including through cost-share assistance), construct, and operate facilities for the city or counties on the federal land for educational or recreational purposes. Requires reversion of the federal land or any part of it to the United States if such land or part ceases to be used for the System in accordance with this Act. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
