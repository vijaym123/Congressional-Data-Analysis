Directs the Secretary of Labor to develop and issue an emergency temporary standard and, not later than 180 days after such issuance, a permanent standard for the protection of workers at risk of exposure, to prevent occupational exposure to infectious agents and toxins. Sets forth minimum requirements for such standards concerning: (1) an infectious agent control plan in settings where health care is delivered; (2) personal protective equipment; (3) training and information, including providing job-specific training and education regarding the prevention of transmission of infectious agents and providing instructional materials for patients and visitors; and (4) medical surveillance for exposed workers."
