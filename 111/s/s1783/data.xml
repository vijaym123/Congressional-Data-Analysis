Dairy COOL Act of 2009 - Amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to extend mandatory country of origin labeling to dairy products (fluid milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, butter, and other dairy products). Requires a dairy product retailer to designate the product's origin as: (1) each country in which or from the one or more dairy ingredients were produced or originated, and each country in which the product was processed; and (2) if a U.S.-produced dairy product, the state, region, or locality where the product was produced.</summary>
