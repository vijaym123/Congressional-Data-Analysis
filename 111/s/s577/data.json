Directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) use the Executive Office of Immigration Review to investigate such immigration fraud crimes; and (2) educate immigrant communities about who may provide legal services and representation in immigration proceedings. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require that: (1) aliens in removal proceedings be provided with a description of who may represent them, including notice that immigration consultants, visa consultants, and other unauthorized individuals may not provide such representation; and (2) the Attorney General provide for lists of persons who are prohibited from providing representation in immigration proceedings."
