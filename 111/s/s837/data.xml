North Korea Sanctions Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of State to designate the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea as a country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism for specified purposes under the Export Administration Act of 1979, the Arms Export Control Act, and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Authorizes the President to waive such requirement upon a certification to Congress that North Korea has taken certain actions regarding: (1) nuclear program and proliferation disclosures; (2) the illegal transfer of missile or nuclear technology; (3) support of international terrorist groups; and (4) prisoner release. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea should be present at all negotiating sessions between the governments of the United States and North Korea.</summary>
