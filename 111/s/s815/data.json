Applies such provision to all applications and petitions pending on or after the date of enactment of this Act. Extends the petition filing deadline for two years after the date of enactment of this Act for an alien spouse if: (1) the U.S. citizen spouse died before the date of enactment of this Act; (2) the alien and the citizen spouse were married for less than two years at the time of the citizen spouse's death; and (3) the alien has not remarried."
