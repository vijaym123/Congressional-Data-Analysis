Authorizes FERC to order an entity to cease and desist from manipulating any market for the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce in violation of a such Act. (Sec. 507) Amends the Natural Gas Act to authorize FERC to order an entity to cease and desist from manipulating the market for the purchase or sale of natural gas or transportation services in violation of such Act. Authorizes FERC to enter into a temporary order requiring a respondent to: (1) cease and desist from a violation of the prohibition on market manipulation that is likely to result in significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to natural gas consumers, or substantial harm to the public interest; and (2) take actions pending completion of the proceedings to prevent the violation, dissipation or conversion of assets, or such harm. Title VI: Policy Studies and Reports - (Sec. 601) Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), to complete and report to Congress on: (1) a comprehensive national helium gas assessment that identifies and quantifies the quantity of helium in each reservoir; and (2) a comprehensive national potash assessment that identifies and quantifies known potash deposits and provides a quantitative assessment of the location and size of undiscovered deposits. (Sec. 603) Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to require the President to transmit to Congress the National Energy Policy Plan (proposed plan) by February 1, 2010, and quadrennially thereafter (currently by April 1, 1979, and biennially thereafter). Requires such proposed plan to analyze the government's policies that encourage: (1) energy production and energy efficiency in the United States; (2) the reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of GHGs in the United States; and (3) the reduction of air pollutants in the environment. Requires the President, acting through the Secretary of Energy, to arrange with the Academy to prepare, review, and submit to Congress reports and analyses that may contribute to the development of the proposed plan. (Sec. 604) Requires the Secretary of Energy, working with the interagency task force established by this Act, to prepare and report to Congress on an interagency report on climate change and energy policy in China and India. (Sec. 605) Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress on: (1) the risk of carbon leakage and changes in U.S. industrial output and investment caused by a potential cap-and-trade program (an economy-wide program enacted by Congress under which GHG emission allowances are distributed or auctioned to control those emissions under the Clean Air Act), in the absence of commensurate GHG emission regulations in other countries; (2) the impact of potential measures to prevent carbon leakage resulting from a cap-and-trade program; and (3) foreign fuel subsidies. (Sec. 607) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require the Secretary to include as part of the annual report on the assessment of renewable energy resources consideration of: (1) the quantity of biomass needed for thermal applications, biofuels, and biomass-based electricity; (2) the highest efficiency energy use of biomass resources; and (3) the requirements and costs associated with deployment of biomass energy resources.
