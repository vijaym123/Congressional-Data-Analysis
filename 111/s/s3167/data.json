Provides that: (1) the Director shall report directly to the Secretary of Commerce; and (2) no U.S. officer or agency shall have authority to require the Director to submit legislative recommendations, testimony, or comments for review prior to the submission to Congress if such submission includes a statement indicating that the views expressed are those of the Bureau of the Census and do not necessarily represent the views of the President. Requires the term of office of the Director to be five years and to begin on January 1, 2012, and every fifth year thereafter. Prohibits an individual from serving more than two full terms as Director. Sets forth provisions governing: (1) vacancies in and removal from office; and (2) the authorities and duties of the Director. Requires the Director to establish a technology advisory committee, whose members shall be selected from the public, private, and academic sectors, to make recommendations to the Director and publish reports on the use of commercially available technologies and services to improve efficiencies and manage costs in the implementation of the census and census-related activities, including pilot projects. Establishes the position of Deputy Director of the Census. Requires the Director to: (1) provide a plan to Congress on how the Bureau will test, develop, and implement an Internet response option for the 2020 Census and the American Community Survey; and (2) submit to the appropriate congressional committees, by the date of submission of the President's budget request for a fiscal year, a comprehensive status report on the next decennial census. Requires each report to include: (1) a description of the Bureau's performance goals for each significant decennial operation; (2) an assessment of the risks associated with each such operation; (3) detailed milestone estimates for each such operation; (4) updated cost estimates for the life cycle of the decennial census; and (5) a detailed description of all contracts over $50 million entered into for each such operation."
