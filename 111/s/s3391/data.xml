Restoring Ecosystem Sustainability and Protection on the Delta Act - Amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to accelerate from FY2017 to FY2010 the allocation of certain Gulf of Mexico oil and gas lease revenues from covered leases among the affected states (thus increasing each state's share). Declares that the historical lease sites in the 2002-2007 planning area shall include all leases entered into by the Secretary of Energy for an area in the Gulf of Mexico between October 1, 1982 (or an earlier date if practicable) and December 31, 2015.</summary>
