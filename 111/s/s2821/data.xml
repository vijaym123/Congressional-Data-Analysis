Trade Reform, Accountability, Development, and Employment Act of 2009 or the TRADE Act of 2009 - Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) review certain free trade agreements (including Uruguay Round Agreements) between the United States and a trade agreement country to evaluate their economic, employment, environmental, national security, health, safety, and other effects; and (2) report on them to the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means, including analyses of specified aspects of each trade agreement and certain information about agreement parties, such as whether the country has a democratic form of government, adopted and enforces certain core labor rights, respects fundamental human rights, enforces rights under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), complies with environmental laws, and poses a potential national security concern. Requires implementing bills of new trade agreements between the United States and another country to include certain standards with respect to: (1) labor; (2) environment and public safety; (3) food and product health and safety; (4) services; (5) investment; (6) procurement; (7) intellectual property; (8) agriculture; (9) trade remedies and safeguards; (10) dispute resolution and enforcement; and (11) technical assistance. Sets forth a point of order to consideration of bills implementing new trade agreements. Requires the President to submit to Congress a plan for the renegotiation of existing trade agreements to bring them into compliance with such standards. Expresses the sense of Congress that certain processes for U.S. trade negotiations should be followed when Congress considers legislation providing special procedures for bills implementing trade agreements.</summary>
