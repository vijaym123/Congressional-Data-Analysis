Defines \"9-1-1 services\" as service including both E-911 services and Next Generation 9-1-1 services.

Requires a report to Congress from: (1) the Administrator of General Services (GSA) identifying the 9-1-1 capabilities of the multi-line telephone system in use by all federal agencies in all federal buildings and properties; and (2) the Comptroller General (GAO) concerning sate and local use of 9-1-1 service charges."
