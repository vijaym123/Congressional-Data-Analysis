Sets the overall rate of such tax at 70% of the amount of such bonuses, 35% payable by federal emergency economic assistance recipients and 35% payable by the employees of such recipients. Exempts bonus recipients who repay bonus amounts to the federal government. Defines \"excessive bonus\" as any retention bonus or other bonus that exceeds $50,000 paid by a federal emergency economic assistance recipient after December 31, 2008. Defines \"federal emergency economic assistance recipient\" as: (1) an entity and its affiliates to which the federal government has paid an aggregate of more than $100 million of assistance and in which the federal government has acquired an equity interest under a program authorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 or the Federal Reserve Act; and (2) the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Limits to $1 million the amount of compensation which a participant in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained by a federal emergency economic assistance recipient may defer in any 12-month period."
