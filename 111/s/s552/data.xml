  <summary>3/9/2009--Introduced.
Maple Tapping Access Program Act of 2009 - Amends the the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a voluntary public access program under which states and tribal governments may apply for grants to encourage owners and operators of privately held farm, ranch, and forest land to voluntarily make such land available for public maple-tapping activities. Gives priority to states and tribal governments that propose to: (1) maximize participation by offering program terms likely to meet with landowner acceptance; (2) ensure that enrolled land has appropriate tree stock; and (3) use additional federal, state, tribal, or private resources in carrying out the program.</summary>
