  <summary>2/4/2010--Introduced.
Citizens Right to Know Act of 2010 - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require issuers of securities to disclose to their shareholders electioneering communications they have made or in which they have participated. Prohibits an issuer from making or participating in any electioneering communication if 51% or more of its outstanding securities are owned or controlled by a foreign principal or agent of a foreign principal. Requires an issuer to obtain prior approval by majority vote of all shareholders before making or participating in any electioneering communication. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require that: (1) audio and television communications be made by the president or chief executive officer of the corporation paying for such communications; and (2) they identify the individual by name and position. Requires a communication paid for by an organization other than a corporation to include a statement listing the names of the three persons making the largest aggregate contributions to the organization during the 12-month period before the date of the communication. Sets forth Internet disclosure requirements for contributors to certain radio and television ads that are electioneering communications.</summary>
