  <summary>6/18/2009--Introduced.
Women's Medical Home Demonstration Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) establish a three-year women's medical home demonstration project to provide enhanced care to women receiving assistance under Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP, formerly known as SCHIP) focusing on specified medical conditions, including premature birth, cervical and breast cancer, menopause, and postpartum depression; (2) establish a Women's Medical Home Advisory Council; and (3) specify standards for certification of certain health care providers as women's medical homes. Defines a "women's medical home" as a physician-led practice, or advanced practice nurse-directed practice, that uses innovations to improve the management and coordination of women's health care and that meets specified standards. Sets forth project goals, including: (1) increasing cost efficiencies of health care delivery, access to appropriate health care services, and patient satisfaction; (2) decreasing inappropriate emergency room utilization, duplication of health care services, and health disparities; and (3) providing appropriate referrals to multidisciplinary services. Authorizes the Secretary to award planning or implementation grants to entities participating in the demonstration project.</summary>
