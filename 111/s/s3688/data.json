Provides for fellowships of between three and six months, during which: (1) time should be allocated for professional training, community service, and cultural immersion activities, including site visits and domestic travel; and (2) the majority of time should be spent in a professional job setting that complements the fellow's professional background and builds relevant professional skill sets. States that the selection of inbound and outbound fellows shall reflect geographic diversity from the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Requires each fellow to complete at least 40 hours of community service in the local community in which the fellow is placed. Encourages the Secretary to defray program costs through public-private partnerships. Requires three reports from the Secretary describing the administration and outcomes of the program. Authorizes appropriations."
