    "text": "Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2010 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard (CG) is operating (the Secretary in this bill, unless otherwise indicated) to prescribe regulations to establish education standards for recreational vessel operators. Establishes within the CG the America's Waterway Watch Program. Authorizes the Secretary to develop protocols, procedures, standards, and requirements for transportation of especially hazardous cargo to promote the safe and secure operation of ports, facilities, and vessels that transport such cargo. Requires the Secretary to initiate the development of an international committee also dedicated to promoting such safe and secure operations. Authorizes the CG Commandant to execute cooperative enforcement agreements with law enforcement agencies under which law agency personnel are deputized and assets are placed under CG control to enforce security zones for the transportation of especially hazardous cargo. Requires the CG Commandant to establish national standards for training, qualification, and credentialing of such personnel. Requires the Secretary to establish a strategic plan for the utilization of certain programs to assist foreign ports and facilities found not to maintain effective antiterrorism measures in the implementation of such measures. Requires an area maritime transportation security plan to establish regional response and recovery protocols to mitigate regional transportation security incidents. Requires the Secretary to ensure the deployment of interoperable communications technology at all interagency operational centers for port security at high-priority U.S. ports. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to require U.S. and foreign commercial vessels that enter a U.S. port or facility to designate a U.S. person who will be responsible for responding to a transportation security incident involving the vessel while in the United States. Directs the Secretary to develop a national standard and formula for prioritizing, addressing, and mitigating assessed security risks at U.S. ports and facilities on or adjacent to a U.S. waterway. Requires owners of U.S facilities that are on or adjacent to U.S. waters that pose a high risk of being involved in a transportation security incident to: (1) make the vulnerability assessment of the facility available to the local port authority and appropriate state or local law enforcement agencies; and (2) integrate the facility's security system with compatible systems operated by state, law enforcement agencies, and the CG. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to negotiate a written agreement with each marine terminal operator governing the use and placement of screening devices on the terminal. Requires the Secretary to establish comprehensive security training requirements that would lead to certification of facility security officers. Establishes in the Treasury a Support of Seafarers Fund. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop a strategic plan to prevent the unauthorized importation of radioactive, chemical, biological, or nuclear agents through all modal pathways coming into the United States; and (2) identify and harmonize electronic filing of vessel passenger and crew lists and entry requirements where appropriate. Requires the DHS Secretary to establish integrated project teams within the science and technology directorate to assist DHS in product research, development, transition, and acquisition activities for cargo security. Amends the SAFE Port Act to: (1) extend authority for the screening and scanning requirements for cargo containers; and (2) exempt the scanning of cargo shipped and transported in accordance with applicable law by the Secretary of State. Prohibits a person from being held liable for monetary damages for using force at sea to defend a vessel against an act of piracy. Authorizes the Secretary to extend for up to one year expiring merchant mariner licenses, certificates of registry, and documents. Prohibits the DHS Secretary from requiring an individual to hold a transportation security card, or be accompanied by a cardholder, if the individual: (1) is engaged in the operation of a live animal-propelled vessel; (2) is not allowed unescorted access to a secure area; and (2) has been issued a license, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's document. Extends funding for the Secretary to conduct pilot projects to test the effectiveness and applicability of new port security projects at U.S. Ports"
