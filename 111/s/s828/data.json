    "text": "Renewable Fuels Pipelines Act of 2009 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to allow federally-guaranteed loans for renewable fuel pipeline construction without regard to whether an appropriation for the cost has been made. Includes ethanol and biodiesel as renewable fuel. Allows a maximum guarantee by the Secretary of Energy of 90% of the pipeline project cost and more than one guarantee for a project (as long as the total guaranteed amount does not exceed 90%). Sets forth factors to be considered in guarantee determinations, including volume and quality of fuel, size of markets served, experience of the entity working with renewable fuel, and associated storage, production, and terminal facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to evaluate a project to assemble a renewable fuel pipeline as a complete project and, as a result of the size and nature of the project, to make a guarantee for an initial loan at a preliminary stage in the loan approval process for the complete project."
