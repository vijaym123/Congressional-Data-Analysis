Sets the rate of such tax at 0.50% of amounts paid under any such contract and limits the aggregate annual amount of tax imposed each year to not more than $500,000. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the tax revenues raised by this Act be used for the financing of a Fair Elections Fund and the public financing of Senate elections."
