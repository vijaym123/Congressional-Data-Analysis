    "text": "National Museum of Industrial History Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to offer to enter into an agreement with an appropriate entity under which to provide federal assistance for the development and operation of an interpretive center and museum on the former Bethlehem Steel Plant Site in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to preserve, display, and interpret historical resources relating to industrialization in the United States and to promote other historical and cultural resources in the region through activities conducted at the interpretive center and museum. Sets forth covered and prohibited uses of such financial assistance, including prohibiting the use of assistance for the acquisition of any item for the museum's collection. Provides for a non-federal match from each party to an agreement. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports to Congress that describe: (1) the current status of the development of the interpretive center and museum; (2) each project and activity funded; and (3) the unexpended balance, if any, of amounts made available to carry out this Act."
