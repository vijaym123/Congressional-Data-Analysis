Authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and specified other federal financial regulators to: (1) exercise oversight over any swap agreement entered into, purchased, or sold by any financial institution, entity, or person (for its own account or for the account of others), and any swap agreement, that is subject to the regulator's jurisdiction; and (2) promulgate, interpret, and enforce regulations, issue orders of general applicability, and impose disclosure, reporting, or recordkeeping requirements relating to any such swap agreement. Grants the SEC sole oversight authority over: (1) any exchange or clearing agency; and (2) any swap agreement traded on or cleared through such exchange or clearing agency. Grants the CFTC sole oversight authority over: (1) any trading facility or registered entity; and (2) any swap agreement executed on, traded on, or cleared through such trading facility or registered entity."
