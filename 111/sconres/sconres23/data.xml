  <summary>6/18/2009--Passed Senate without amendment.
Supports the goals of the 2009 Prague Conference on Holocaust Era Assets. Applauds: (1) the government of the Czech Republic for hosting the Conference; and (2) the participating countries for the decision to seek justice for Holocaust survivors and to promote Holocaust remembrance and education. Urges: (1) the countries in Central and Eastern Europe which have not already done so to return looted and confiscated properties to their rightful owners or, where restitution is not possible, provide equitable compensation; and (2) all countries to make a priority of returning to Jewish communities any religious or communal property that was stolen as a result of the Holocaust. Calls on all countries to facilitate the use of the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art in settling all claims involving publicly and privately held objects. Calls on the President to send a high-level official, such as the Secretary of State, to represent the United States at the Conference and urges other invited countries to participate at a similarly high level.</summary>
