  <summary>4/22/2009--Passed Senate without amendment.
Supports the goals of Malaria Awareness Day (April 25 of each year), including the achievable target of ending malaria deaths by 2015. Reaffirms: (1) the commitments to combat malaria in the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008; and (2) U.S. support for achievement of the targets set by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership Global Malaria Action plan. Commends the progress made by anti-malaria programs, including the President's Malaria Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Encourages fellow donor nations to maintain their support and honor their funding commitments for malaria programs. Urges greater integration of U.S. and international health programs targeting malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, neglected tropical diseases, and basic child and maternal health. Commits to continued U.S. leadership in efforts to reduce global malaria deaths.</summary>
