  <summary>4/21/2010--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) U.S. national interests are not advanced by becoming a State Party to the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court; (2) the Statute undermines U.S. sovereignty, hinders its ability to defend itself, and conflicts with U.S. constitutional principles; and (3) President Obama should declare that the United States does not intend to ratify the Statute and does not consider itself to be a treaty signatory, and will not attend the May 2010 Review Conference of the Rome Statute in Kampala, Uganda.</summary>
