  <summary>6/25/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that any health care reform legislation should include, with respect to health plans: (1) support for consumer education and assistance with enrollment; (2) assistance for people asserting consumer rights; (3) a strengthened system of consumer protections, including an appeal mechanism within a health plan, coverage for emergency care without prior authorization, verification of accurate out-of-network copayment charges, and protections against balance billing in emergency situations and where in-network providers are unavailable, against mid-year health plan changes that could impact the enrollee's cost-sharing or access to services, and against misleading marketing; and (4) a strengthened enforcement system of consumer rights for claims involving systemic violations of consumer protections, including sanctions.</summary>
