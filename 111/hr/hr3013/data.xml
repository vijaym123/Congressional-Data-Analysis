  <summary>6/24/2009--Introduced.
Requires the Secretary of Commerce, beginning with the 2010 decennial census of population, to take measures in tabulating total population by state for purposes of apportionment of Representatives in Congress to ensure that all Americans residing abroad on the census date are accurately counted and properly attributed to their respective states. Requires such measures to include methods: (1) by which administrative records of a nongovernmental organization may be used to enumerate organization members residing overseas as of the census date if such records satisfy the Secretary's criteria; and (2) under which an international "Be Counted" form may be completed at a U.S. embassy by Americans residing overseas.</summary>
