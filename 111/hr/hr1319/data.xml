  <summary>12/8/2009--Passed House amended.
Informed P2P User Act - (Sec. 2) Makes it unlawful for any commercial entity that developed a file sharing program or distributed such a program (if the distributor is owned by the developing entity) to install, make available for installation, or download a file sharing program without: (1) immediately before program installation or downloading, providing conspicuous notice that the program allows files to be searched and copied by one or more other computers and obtaining informed consent to the installation from an owner; and (2) immediately before initial activation of a file sharing function of the program, providing conspicuous notice of which files will be made available and obtaining the owner's informed consent. Exempts: (1) modifications or upgrades of a program that was originally installed in compliance with this Act, provided certain requirements are met; and (2) pre-installed software. Makes it unlawful for such an entity to prevent the reasonable efforts of an owner or authorized user to block the installation of such a program or to prevent such a user from having a reasonable way to disable or remove the program. (Sec. 3) Treats a violation of this Act as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Prohibits construing this Act to limit or supersede any other federal or state law. (Sec. 4) Defines "protected computer" to include a computer used by a financial institution or the federal government or which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a way that affects U.S. interstate or foreign commerce. (Sec. 6) Makes this Act inapplicable to the federal or any state government or subdivision.</summary>
