Fair Access to Veterans Benefits Act of 2010 - Extends the 120-day limit for the filing of an appeal to the Court of Veterans Appeals after a final decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals upon a showing of good cause for such time as justice may require. Considers as good cause the inability of a person to file within the 120-day period due to a service-connected disability. Makes such extension applicable to appeals of final Board decisions issued on or after July 24, 2008.</summary>
