Requires the committee to be co-chaired by senior level officials from OSTP and the Department of State. Requires the committee to: (1) plan and coordinate interagency international science and technology cooperative research and training activities and partnerships supported or managed by federal agencies; (2) establish federal priorities and policies for aligning such international science and technology cooperative research and training activities and partnerships with the foreign policy goals of the United States; (3) identify opportunities for new international science and technology cooperative research and training partnerships that advance science and technology and U.S. foreign policy priorities; (4) solicit recommendations from non-federal science and technology stakeholders; (5) work with international science and technology counterparts to establish and maintain partnerships; and (6) address broad issues that influence the ability of U.S. scientists and engineers to collaborate with foreign counterparts. Requires the Director of OSTP to report annually to Congress on: (1) the priorities and policies established under this Act; (2) the ongoing and new partnerships identified in the previous year; and (3) how stakeholder input was received."
