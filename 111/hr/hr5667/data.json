Defines \"microstamping technology\" to mean the process or technology of etching, engraving or otherwise imprinting on the interior surface or internal working parts of a firearm a microscopic array of alpha numeric characters, bar, gear, or other code or symbol that identifies the make, model, and serial number of the firearm."
