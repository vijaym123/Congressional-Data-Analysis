Requires the Grant Program to provide competitive matching grants to state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, community organizations, universities, and others to carry out Restoration Program purposes. Requires the Director to develop criteria to ensure that funded activities: (1) restore or protect fish and wildlife species and their habitats; (2) improve or protect water quality by reducing nonpoint and point source pollutants; (3) reduce or improve management of water volume and flooding; (4) address priority needs or actions identified in the single plan adopted; and/or (5) include activities with multiple benefits in the Basin, including habitat, water quality, and flood protection. Limits the federal share of the total cost of a funded project to 75%. Authorizes the Director to contract with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation or another organization with the expertise to manage the Grant Program."
