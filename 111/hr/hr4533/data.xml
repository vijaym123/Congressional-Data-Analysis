Technology Bill of Rights for the Blind Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to study and report to Congress on methods by which blind consumers can gain nonvisual access to consumer electronic devices, electronic kiosks, home appliances, or office technology devices. Requires the Secretary to promulgate a minimum nonvisual access standard for each type of covered device that will ensure nonvisual access to such device by blind consumers. Applies a minimum nonvisual access standard to a covered device that is manufactured after the date that is two years after the date on which such standard is promulgated. Directs the Secretary to establish an Office of Nonvisual Access Compliance to assist the Secretary, educate manufacturers, and conduct investigations. Imposes civil penalties in certain circumstances. Allows civil suits by blind consumers against manufacturers for monetary damages and equitable relief. Allows punitive damages for willful or repeated violations. Prohibits construing this Act to limit the rights of blind or low-vision individuals.</summary>
