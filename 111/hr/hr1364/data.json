Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a pilot program to make grants to public and nonprofit entities to provide: (1) substance abuse treatment services in the form of long-term counseling; (2) substance abuse prevention services to individuals who are less than 21 years of age; and (3) services that facilitate interaction between individuals receiving treatment for substance abuse and individuals receiving prevention services in a manner that enhances both such services."
