  <summary>7/31/2009--Introduced.
Orphan Highway Restoration Act - Defines "orphan highway" to mean a highway that: (1) formerly was a U.S. numbered highway; (2) no longer is a principal route for traffic passing through a state; and (3) because of decreased importance to statewide transportation, has received only routine maintenance but needs significant restoration. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) make grants and provide technical assistance to states and local government units to restore orphan highways; and (2) allocate funds to grant recipients for FY2010-FY2015 based on a calculated formula.</summary>
