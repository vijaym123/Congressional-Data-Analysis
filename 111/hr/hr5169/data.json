    "text": "Event Data Recorder Enhancement Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to modify certain federal motor vehicle safety standards to require that passenger automobiles (except trailers) be equipped with: (1) an event data recorder (EDR) meeting certain requirements; and (2) a standardized port for accessing and retrieving data stored in any EDR regardless of the manufacturer or model of the motor vehicle. Requires manufacturers of passenger automobiles to include EDRs in: (1) at least 25% of their fleet beginning in model 2013; (2) at least 65% of their fleet beginning in model year 2014; and (3) 100% of their fleet beginning in model year 2015. Requires the owner's manual of new motor vehicles sold or leased in the United States to indicate clearly the presence of EDRs. Prohibits the retrieval of information recorded or transmitted by an EDR by any other person than the owner of the motor vehicle in which such device is installed unless: (1) authorized by court order, the owner consents, or the information is retrieved by a government motor vehicle safety agency; and (2) the personally identifiable information of the owner or driver of the vehicle or vehicle identification number (VIN) is not disclosed in the retrieval of information."
