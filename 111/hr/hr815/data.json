Directs the Secretary, upon finding that the article is adulterated or misbranded and there is a reasonable probability that human consumption would present a threat to public health, to: (1) provide all appropriate persons an opportunity to cease distribution of the article, make appropriate notifications, and recall the article; and (2) require an immediate cessation of distribution if voluntary action is not taken. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) refuse to provide, or to withdraw, inspections of an establishment for willful or repeated violations of the respective Act; (2) deny or suspend inspection in the public interest to protect the health or welfare of consumers or to ensure the effective performance of an official duty under the respective Act; and (3) assess civil penalties for violations. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require a person (other than a household consumer or other individual who is an intended consumer) who has reason to believe that an article of food introduced into interstate commerce is adulterated or misbranded in a manner that, if consumed, may result in illness or injury to notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Directs the Secretary, upon finding that to be the case, to: (1) provide all appropriate persons an opportunity to cease distribution of such article, make appropriate notifications, and recall the article; and (2) require an immediate cessation of distribution if voluntary action is not taken. Allows the Secretary to assess penalties for prohibited acts."
