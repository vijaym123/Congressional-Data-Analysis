  <summary>7/15/2010--Introduced.
Authorizes the head of the Department of Defense (DOD), each of the military departments, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (agency head), in the procurement of property or services, to use procedures other than competitive procedures when the contract is for a military construction project at a military installation in a state, the state provided all funding for the project, and the agency head: (1) determines that it is in its best interest to limit the sources for bids or proposals to prospective contractors with a physical presence in that state; and (2) notifies the congressional defense and appropriations committees of such determination at least 30 days before the contract award.</summary>
