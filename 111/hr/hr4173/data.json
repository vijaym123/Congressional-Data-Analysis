    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since the Conference Report was filed in the House on June 29, 2010. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act - Title I: Financial Stability - Financial Stability Act of 2010 - Subtitle A: Financial Stability Oversight Council - (Sec. 111) Establishes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council), consisting of the heads of specified federal financial regulatory bodies and chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury. (Sec. 112) Requires the Council, among other things, to: (1) identify risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace; (2) promote market discipline, by eliminating expectations on the part of shareholders, creditors, and counterparties of such companies that the Government will shield them from losses in the event of failure; (3) respond to emerging threats to the stability of the financial system. Includes among the Council's duties: (1) identifying gaps in regulation that could pose risks to U.S. financial stability; (2) requiring supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve Board) for nonbank financial companies that may pose risks to U.S. financial stability in the event of their material financial distress or failure, or because of specified activities; (3) making recommendations to the Board concerning the establishment of heightened prudential standards for risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, contingent capital, and overall risk management for nonbank financial companies and large, interconnected bank holding companies supervised by the Board; and (4) identifying systemically important financial market utilities and payment, clearing, and settlement activities. (Sec. 113) Authorizes the Council to determine that a foreign or a U.S. nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Federal Reserve Board and subject to prudential standards under this Act, if the Council determines that material financial distress, or activities at the company, could threaten U.S. financial stability. Authorizes the company, upon the Council's determination, to establish an intermediate holding company in which its financial activities (and those of its subsidiaries) are conducted in compliance with Board regulations or guidance. Subjects such intermediate holding company to Board supervision and to prudential standards under this Act as if it were a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board. Restricts Board supervision to the company's financial activities only. Requires the Council, in exercising its duties with respect to foreign nonbank financial companies, foreign-based bank holding companies, and cross-border activities and markets, to consult with appropriate foreign regulatory authorities. (Sec. 114) Requires any nonbank financial company determined to come under Board supervision to register with the Federal Reserve Board. (Sec. 115) Authorizes the Council to recommend to the Board prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements for Board-supervised nonbank financial companies and large, interconnected bank holding companies that: (1) are more stringent than those for other nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the U.S. financial stability; and (2) increase in stringency, based upon specified considerations. Requires the Council to study and report to Congress on the feasibility, benefits, costs, and structure of a contingent capital requirement for Board-supervised nonbank financial companies and large, interconnected bank holding companies. Authorizes the Council to make recommendations to the Board about Board-supervised nonbank financial companies and large, interconnected bank holding companies, including: (1) required periodic reports on company plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure; (2) company credit exposure; (3) standards to limit risks posed by failure of any individual company to other companies; and (3) short-term company debt limits. (Sec. 116) Authorizes the Council, acting through the Office of Financial Research, to require a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more or a Board-supervised nonbank financial company (and subsidiaries) to submit certified reports of condition and risk management systems. (Sec. 117) Treats as a Board-supervised nonbank financial company any entity that: (1) was a bank holding company having total consolidated assets 50 billion or more as of January 1, 2010; (2) received financial assistance under or participated in the Capital Purchase Program established under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA); or (3) is a successor entity. Prescribes a procedure for appeal from such treatment. (Sec. 118) Treats Council expenses as expenses of, and paid by, the Office of Financial Research. (Sec. 119) Prescribes procedures for resolution by the Council of supervisory jurisdictional disputes among member agencies. (Sec. 120) Authorizes the Council, in specified circumstances, to provide for more stringent regulation of a financial activity by issuing recommendations to primary financial regulatory agencies to apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for a financial activity or practice conducted by bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies. Requires such primary agencies to impose the standards recommended by the Council. (Sec. 121) Requires the Federal Reserve Board to take mitigatory actions restricting the activities of bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, or Board-supervised nonbank financial companies, which pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability, including: (1) limiting the company's ability to become affiliated with another company; (2) restricting the company's ability to offer a financial product or products; (3) requiring the company to terminate one or more activities; (4) imposing conditions on the manner in which the company conducts activities; or (5) requiring the company to transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities. (Sec. 122) Authorizes the Comptroller General to audit Council activities. (Sec. 123) Instructs the Council Chairperson to study and report to Congress on the economic impact of possible financial services regulatory limitations intended to reduce systemic risk. Subtitle B: Office of Financial Research - (Sec. 152) Establishes within the Department of the Treasury the Office of Financial Research (OFR) to support the Council and member agencies in: (1) collecting and standardizing data collections; (2) performing applied research and essential long-term research; and (3) developing risk measurement and monitoring tools. (Sec. 154) Establishes the Data Center and the Research and Analysis Center to carry out OFR programmatic responsibilities. (Sec. 155) Establishes the Financial Research Fund in the Treasury as depository for funds and assessments designated for the OFR. Subtitle C: Additional Board of Governors Authority for Certain Nonbank Financial Companies and Bank Holding Companies - (Sec. 161) Authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to require a nonbank financial company under its supervision (and any subsidiary) to report under oath regarding its financial condition, its systems for monitoring and controlling risks, and the extent to which its activities and operations threaten U.S. financial stability. Authorizes the Board to examine such companies regarding such matters. (Sec. 162) Subjects a Board-supervised nonbank financial company (and any subsidiaries that are not depository institutions) to specified enforcement proceedings of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) in the same manner and to the same extent as if it were a bank holding company. Authorizes the Board to recommend that primary financial regulatory agency initiate supervisory actions or enforcement proceedings against noncompliant depository institution or functionally regulated subsidiaries. (Sec. 163) Treats a Board-supervised nonbank financial company as a statutory bank holding company for purposes of requirements governing bank acquisitions. Requires a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more or a Board-supervised nonbank financial company to notify the Board in writing in advance of any transaction in which it acquires direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of a company (other than an insured depository institution) which: (1) has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more; and (2) is engaged in specified activities under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. (Sec. 164) Treats a Board-supervised nonbank financial company as a bank holding company for purposes of the Depository Institutions Management Interlocks Act. Prohibits the Board, however, from permitting service by a management official of a Board-supervised nonbank financial company as a management official of any bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, or any other Board-supervised nonaffiliated nonbank financial company (except to provide a temporary exemption for interlocks resulting from a merger, acquisition, or consolidation). (Sec. 165) Requires the Board to establish, for Board-supervised nonbank financial companies and for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, prudential standards addressing specified requirements that: (1) are more stringent than those for other nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the U.S. financial stability; and (2) increase in stringency, based upon specified considerations. Authorizes the Board to require each Board-supervised nonbank financial company and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to maintain a minimum amount of contingent capital convertible to equity in times of financial stress. Directs the Board to require each Board-supervised nonbank financial company and such bank holding companies to report periodically: (1) their plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure; and (2) the nature and extent of their credit exposure. Requires the Board to prescribe standards limiting the risks and credit exposure that failure of any individual company could pose to a Board-supervised nonbank financial company or to a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. Requires such regulations to prohibit credit exposure exceeding 25% of a company's capital stock and surplus (or a lower amount, if necessary). Authorizes the Board to prescribe a limit on the amount of short-term debt, including off-balance sheet exposures, that may be accumulated by bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more or Board-supervised nonbank financial companies. Directs the Board to require each publicly-traded Board-supervised nonbank financial company to establish a risk committee responsible for the oversight of the enterprise-wide risk management practices. Requires the Board to conduct annual analyses in which Board-supervised nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are subject to evaluation of whether such companies have the capital, on a total consolidated basis, necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions (stress tests). Directs the Board to require a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more or a Board-supervised nonbank financial company (but not any federal home loan bank) to maintain a debt to equity ratio of no more than 15 to 1, upon Council determination that the company poses a grave threat to the U.S. financial stability and that this requirement is necessary to mitigate that risk. Requires the computation of capital in such companies to take into account any off-balance-sheet activities for purposes of meeting their capital requirements. (Sec. 166) Directs the Federal Reserve Board to prescribe early remediation requirements to address the financial distress of a Board-supervised nonbank financial company or a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. (Sec. 167) Authorizes the Board to require any nonbank financial company it supervises that conducts activities that are not financial in nature or incidental thereto under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to establish and conduct all or a portion of such activities that are financial in nature or incidental thereto in or through an affiliated intermediate holding company. Requires a company that directly or indirectly controls an intermediate holding company established under such affiliation procedures to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary intermediate holding company. (Sec. 170) Directs the Board to promulgate criteria for exempting from its supervision certain types or classes of U.S. nonbank financial companies or foreign nonbank financial companies. (Sec. 171) Directs federal banking agencies to establish, on a consolidated basis, minimum leverage capital requirements and minimum risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions (except federal home loan banks), depository institution holding companies, and Board-supervised nonbank financial companies. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on access to capital by smaller insured depository institutions. Requires the federal banking agencies to develop capital requirements for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and Board-supervised nonbank financial companies that address the risks their activities pose, including the risk to other public and private stakeholders in the event of adverse performance, disruption, or failure of the institution or the activity. (Sec. 172) Amends the FDIA to subject Board-supervised nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to examination and enforcement action for insurance and liquidation purposes whenever the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) determines that a special examination is necessary. (Sec. 173) Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 to authorize the Federal Reserve Board, when considering an application to establish in the United States a foreign bank that presents a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system, to take into account whether the foreign bank's home country has adopted, or is making demonstrable progress toward adopting, an appropriate system of regulation for its financial system to mitigate such risk.

(Sec. 934) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require each NRSRO to refer to the appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities any information that it receives from a third party and finds credible that alleges that an issuer of securities rated by the NRSRO has committed or is committing a material violation of law that has not been adjudicated by a federal or state court. (Sec. 935) Requires an NRSRO, in producing a credit rating, to consider information which it finds credible that it has, or receives about an issuer from a source other than the issuer or underwriter, and which it finds potentially significant to a rating decision. (Sec. 936) Directs the SEC to: (1) prescribe qualification standards to ensure the accuracy of securities ratings issued by credit rating analysts; (2) require each NRSRO to establish and enforce written policies and procedures that assess the probability that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will fail to make payments to investors in accordance with the terms of such instrument; and ( 3) define clearly and disclose the meaning of any symbol used by the NRSRO to denote a credit rating, and apply it in a consistent manner for all types of instruments for which it is used.

(Sec. 955) Directs the SEC to require each issuer to disclose, in any proxy or consent solicitation material for an shareholders' annual meeting, whether any employee or member of the board of directors, including designees, is permitted to purchase financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of equity securities granted as part of a compensation package, or held by them. (Sec. 956) Directs federal regulators to jointly prescribe regulations requiring depository institutions or depository institution holding companies to disclose the structures of all incentive-based compensation arrangements in order to determine whether such structure: (1) provides excessive compensation, fees, or benefits to an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder; or (2) could lead to material financial loss to such institutions. Directs federal regulators to jointly prescribe regulations prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements that the regulators determine encourage inappropriate risks by such institutions by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. Exempts financial institutions with assets of less than $1 billion from such compensation restrictions.

Instructs the Federal Reserve Board to prescribe regulations requiring depository institutions to establish procedures to assure and monitor compliance with this Act. (Sec. 1403) Prohibits: (1) steering incentives in connection with residential mortgage loan origination;and (2) restructuring of a financing origination fee, except in certain circumstances. Directs the Board to prohibit specified mortgage origination practices, including steering a consumer to a residential mortgage loan that: (1) the consumer lacks a reasonable ability to repay; or (2) has predatory characteristics or effects (such as equity stripping, excessive fees, or abusive terms). (Sec. 1404) Sets forth the maximum liability of a mortgage originator to a consumer for violation of the residential mortgage loan origination requirements of this title, in addition to court costs and attorney fees, at the greater of: (1) actual damages; or (2) three times the total amount of direct and indirect compensation or gain accruing to the originator in connection with the loan involved. (Sec. 1405) Requires the Board to prohibit or condition terms, acts, or practices relating to residential mortgage loans that are found to be either: (1) abusive, unfair, deceptive, predatory; or (2) necessary or proper to ensure that responsible, affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers in a manner consistent with Board-prescribed minimum standards for residential mortgage loans to prevent their circumvention or evasion or to facilitate compliance with them; or (3) not in the borrower's interest. (Sec. 1406) Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to study regulatory requirements that would provide: (1) widespread use of shared appreciation mortgages to strengthen local housing markets; (2) new opportunities for affordable home ownership; and (3) homeowners at risk of foreclosure with the ability to refinance or modify their mortgages. Subtitle B: Minimum Standards for Mortgages - (Sec. 1411) Prescribes minimum standards for residential mortgage loans, including a requirement that a residential mortgage loan creditor: (1) make a reasonable and good faith determination based upon verified and documented information that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay all loans on the same dwelling and applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and assessments; (2) use a fully amortizing repayment schedule for purposes of determining a consumer's ability to repay a variable rate loan that defers repayment of principal or interest; and (3) verify amounts of income or assets upon which such creditor relies to determine repayment ability by reviewing the consumer's Internal Revenue Service Form W-2, tax returns, payroll receipts, financial institution records, or other third-party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's income or assets. Exempts from the income verification requirement under certain conditions: (1) streamlined refinancings made by certain federal departments or agencies, and (2) reverse mortgages and bridge loans,. (Sec. 1412) Authorizes any creditor or assignee subject to liability under this Act with respect to any residential mortgage loan to presume that it has met the minimum standards for such a loan if it is a qualified mortgage meeting specified criteria that does not result in a balloon payment. Authorizes the Board by regulation to include as a qualified mortgage any balloon loan meeting the same specified criteria if it meets certain other criteria as well, including that it is extended by a creditor operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas. (Sec. 1413) Authorizes a consumer, in a foreclosure proceeding on a residential mortgage loan, to assert as a matter of defense by recoupment or set off without regard for the time limit on a private action for damages under TILA, that the foreclosure-initiating creditor, assignee, or other holder of the mortgage: (1) violated the prohibition against certain steering incentives, or (2) failed to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the consumer had a reasonable ability to repay the mortgage. (Sec. 1414) Prohibits specified practices, including: (1) certain prepayment penalties on specified mortgage loans; (2) single premium credit insurance; (3) mandatory arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure (except for reverse mortgages); (4) residential mortgage loan terms that waive a statutory cause of action by the consumer; and (5) mortgages with negative amortization (except, again, for reverse mortgages), unless certain disclosures are made and a first-time borrower receives home ownership counseling. Excludes from the meaning of qualified mortgage for these purposes any residential mortgage loan with: (1) an adjustable rate; or (2) an annual percentage rate (APR) exceeding the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction, as of the date the interest rate is set according to a specified formula. Requires publication of average prime offer rates and APR thresholds. Requires a creditor or mortgage originator, before loan consummation or loan refinancing, to disclose the protection provided by a state anti-deficiency law and its significance for the consumer upon the loss of that protection. (A state anti-deficiency law shields a consumer mortgagor from liability for any deficiency between a foreclosure sale price and the outstanding balance of the mortgage.) Requires a residential mortgage loan creditor to disclose before settlement: (1) the creditor's policy regarding partial payments and their application to the mortgage, and (2) whether partial payments will be placed in escrow.

Subtitle C: High-Cost Mortgages - (Sec. 1431) Prescribes standards for points and fees related to: (1) high-cost mortgages; (2) open-end consumer credit plans; and (3) bona fide discount points and prepayment penalties. (Sec. 1432) Repeals the allowance of prepayment penalties for certain mortgages. Prohibits a high-cost mortgage from containing a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large (balloon payment) as the average of earlier scheduled payments. (Sec. 1433) Prescribes additional requirements for certain mortgages. Prohibits a creditor from: (1) recommending default on an existing debt prior to and in connection with the closing of a high-cost mortgage that refinances any portion of such debt; (2) imposing late payment fees in connection with a high-cost mortgage except in compliance with specified requirements; (3) accelerating debt on a high-cost mortgage (except in certain circumstances); or (4) financing, in connection with any high-cost mortgage, either a prepayment fee or penalty payable by the consumer if the creditor is the note holder of the note being refinanced.

Prohibits any fee for payoff statements other than a processing fee. Requires a creditor, as a prerequisite to extending consumer credit under a high-cost mortgage, to receive certification from a HUD-approved counselor that the consumer has received counseling on the advisability of the mortgage. Prescribes a procedure by which a high cost loan creditor or assignee that, acting in good faith, commits an unintentional violation of these prohibitions and other requirements may make timely corrections and avoid liability for the violation. Subtitle D: Office of Housing Counseling - Expand and Preserve Home Ownership Through Counseling Act - (Sec. 1442) Amends the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act to establish within HUD the Office of Housing Counseling, whose Director shall have primary responsibility for all activities and matters relating to both home ownership and rental housing counseling. (Sec. 1443) Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to require the HUD Secretary to: (1) prescribe counseling procedures for home ownership and rental counseling; and (2) provide for certification of computer software programs for consumers to evaluate different residential mortgage loan proposals. Requires the Director to: (1) develop and conduct national public service multimedia campaigns promoting housing counseling; and (2) use specified funds to conduct foreclosure rescue education programs, with emphasis upon retirement and low-income minority communities.

(Sec. 1450) Amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) to require the CFPB Director to: (1) prepare, at least once every five years, a booklet to help federally related mortgage loan applicants of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds to understand the nature and costs of real estate settlement services; and (2) distribute to all lenders that make federally related mortgage loans both the booklets and lists of HUD-certified home ownership counselors. (Sec. 1451) Requires the HUD Secretary to take necessary steps to inform potential home buyers, through FHA-approved mortgage lenders, of the availability and importance of obtaining an independent home inspection. (Sec. 1452) Allocates specified funds to the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for activities to make borrowers who are delinquent on certain loans aware of the dangers of fraudulent activities associated with foreclosure. Subtitle E: Mortgage Servicing - (Sec. 1461) Amends TILA to require a creditor in a non-credit card consumer credit transaction secured by a first lien on the principal dwelling (other than a reverse mortgage) to establish an escrow or impound account for mandatory periodic payments or premiums (including taxes, insurance, and ground rents). Allows exemptions from this requirement for creditors that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas and retain their mortgage originations in portfolio. Prohibits making an escrow or impound account a condition of a real property sale contract or a loan secured by a first deed of trust or mortgage on the consumer's principal dwelling unless specified circumstances exist. Requires such escrow or impound account to remain in existence for at least five years until sufficient equity exists so that private mortgage insurance is no longer required, or unless the underlying mortgage is terminated. States that: (1) escrow accounts need not be established for loans secured by shares in a cooperative; and (2) insurance premiums need not be included in escrow accounts for loans secured by condominium units if the condominium association has an obligation to unit owners to maintain a master insurance policy. Requires: (1) escrow accounts to be established in a federally insured depository institution or credit union; and (2) each creditor to pay interest on the amount held in such accounts as required by state or federal law. Requires specified consumer disclosures regarding a mandatory escrow or impound account before consummation of the credit transaction giving rise to such account. (Sec. 1462) Requires creditors to provide specified disclosures for consumers who waive escrow services. (Sec. 1463) Amends RESPA to prohibit the servicer of a federally related mortgage from engaging in certain practices, including obtaining force-placed hazard insurance, unless there is reason to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract requirements. (Force-placed hazard insurance is coverage obtained by the servicer when the borrower has failed to comply with hazard insurance requirements under the terms of the mortgage.) Prescribes notice and borrower non-response requirements for loan servicers to obtain force-placed insurance. Doubles the penalties for loan servicer noncompliance with RESPA disclosure requirements. Reduces from 20 days to 5 days the time limit within which loan servicers are required to respond to borrower inquiries. Requires any remaining escrow balance that is within the control of the loan servicer at the time the loan is paid off to be: (1) promptly returned to the borrower within 20 business days; or (2) credited to a similar account for a new mortgage loan to the borrower with the same lender. (Sec. 1464) Amends TILA to prohibit a loan servicer, except in a specified circumstance, from failing to credit a payment to the consumer's account as of the date of receipt. Requires a creditor or servicer of a home loan to send an accurate payoff balance no later than seven business days after receipt of a written request for it. (Sec. 1465) Requires repayment disclosures regarding a first mortgage- or lien-secured consumer credit transaction to take into account the amount of monthly escrow payments, including: (1) the taxable assessed value of the real property securing the transaction after consummation of the transaction, (2) the value of any improvements on the property or to be constructed on it, and (3) the replacement costs of the property for hazard insurance in the initial year after the transaction. Subtitle F: Appraisal Activities - (Sec. 1471) Amends TILA to set forth property appraisal requirements for a creditor who extends higher-risk mortgage credit to a consumer, including: (1) a written appraisal performed by a certified or licensed appraiser who conducts a physical property visit of the interior of the mortgaged property; (2) a free copy of such appraisal to the applicant before the transaction closing date; and (3) a statement by the creditor at the time of the initial mortgage application that the appraisal is for its sole use, and that the applicant, at its own expense, may choose to have a separate appraisal. Requires a creditor to obtain a second appraisal from a different certified or licensed appraiser if the purpose of a higher-risk mortgage (other than a HUD-insured reverse mortgage) is to finance the purchase or acquisition of the mortgaged property from a person within 180 days of the purchase or acquisition of such property by that person at a price lower than the current sale price of the property. (Sec. 1472)Prescribes appraisal independence requirements. Declares unlawful specified acts or practices that violate such requirements in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. Includes among unfair and deceptive practices any appraisal of a property offered as security in which a person with an interest in the underlying transaction compensates, coerces, extorts, colludes, instructs, induces, bribes, or intimidates a person conducting or involved in the appraisal. Includes, in addition, among such practices: (1) mischaracterizing, or suborning mischaracterization of, the appraised value of the property securing the extension of the credit; (2) seeking to influence an appraiser or otherwise to encourage a targeted value in order to facilitate the transaction; and (3) withholding or threatening to withhold timely payment for an appraisal report or for appraisal services rendered. Prohibits a certified or licensed appraiser or appraisal management company from having an interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or transaction involving the appraisal. Authorizes the Board, the CFPB, and designated federal agencies to jointly issue regulations addressing the issue of appraisal report portability, including regulations that ensure such portability between lenders for a consumer credit transaction secured by a 1-4 unit single family residence that is the principal dwelling of the consumer, or mortgage brokerage services for such a transaction. Subjects to civil penalties violations of appraisal independence requirements. Declares that the deference that a court accords to the CFPB with respect to its determination of the meaning or interpretation of any TILA provisions (except property appraisal requirements) shall be applied as if the CFPB were the only agency authorized to apply, enforce, interpret, or administer such provisions. (Sec. 1473) Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) to condition the establishment by a federal financial institutions regulatory agency and the Resolution Trust Corporation of a threshold level at or below which a certified or licensed appraiser is not required to perform appraisals in connection with federally related transactions on the agency's receiving concurrence from the CFPB that such threshold level provides reasonable protection for consumers who purchase 1-4 unit single-family residences. Directs the Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) to detail in its annual report to Congress: (1) the results of all audits of state appraiser regulatory agencies; and (2) an accounting of disapproved actions and warnings taken in the previous year, including the conditions causing the disapproval and the actions taken to achieve compliance. Requires Subcommittee meetings to be open to the public, but authorizes the closing of certain portions related to personnel and review of preliminary state audit reports. Requires the Subcommittee to: (1) monitor state requirements for the registration and supervision of an appraisal management company; and (2) maintain a national registry of appraisal management companies that either are registered with and subject to supervision of a state appraiser certifying and licensing agency or are operating subsidiaries of a federally regulated financial institution. Directs designated federal financial regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the CFPB, to jointly establish, by rule, minimum requirements a state must apply in the registration of appraisal management companies. Applies these same requirements to, and exempts from any state registration requirement, an appraisal management company that is a subsidiary owned and controlled by a financial institution and regulated by a federal financial institution regulatory age ncy. Sets forth: (1) registration limitations; (2) additional state agency reporting requirements; and (3) revised registry fees. Authorizes the Subcommittee to award grants to state appraiser certifying and licensing agencies in order to support their compliance with this Act. Requires the requirements for state licensing of an appraiser to meet or exceed the minimum cr iteria issued by the Appraisal Qualifications Board of The Appraisal Foundation for the licensing of real estate appraisers. Requires the Subcommittee to monitor whether each state appraiser certifying and licensing agency: (1) processes complaints and completes investigations in a reasonable time period; (2) appropriately disciplines sanctioned appraisers and appraisal management companies; (3) maintains an effective regulatory program; and (4) reports complaints and disciplinary actions on a timely basis to the national registries on appraisers and appraisal management companies. Authorizes the Subcommittee to: (1) remove a state licensed or certified appraiser or a registered appraisal management company from a national registry on an interim basis pending state agency action on licensing, certification, registration, and disciplinary proceedings; (2) impose sanctions against a state agency that fails to have an effective appraiser regulatory program; and (3) impose interim actions and suspensions against a state agency as an alternative to, or in advance of, derecognition of a state agency. Prohibits appraisal of a federally related transaction by a state- certified or -licensed appraiser unless the state appraiser certifying or licensing agency has in place a policy of issuing a reciprocal certification or license for an individual from another state who meets certain state licensure standards. Requires the Subcommittee to monitor each state appraiser certifying and licensing agency to determine whether: (1) its policies, practices, and procedures are consistent with maintaining appraiser independence; and (2) such state has effective regulations, and policies regarding the maintenance of appraiser independence. Requires the Subcommittee to establish and operate an Appraisal Complaint National Hotline, including a toll-free telephone number and an email address. Requires designated federal financial institution regulatory agencies, including the CFPB and the Subcommittee,to promulgate regulations to implement quality control standards governing automated valuation models (computerized models used by mortgage originators and secondary market issuers to determine the collateral worth of a mortgage secured by a consumer's principal dwelling). Prohibits the use of broker price opinions as the primary basis to evaluate property for loan origination in connection with a residential mortgage loan secured by such property. (Defines broker price opinion as an estimate prepared by a real estate broker, agent, or sales person that: (1) details the probable selling price of a particular piece of real estate property; and (2) provides a varying level of detail about the property's condition, market, and neighborhood, and information on comparable sales; but (3) does not include an automated valuation model.) Amends the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 to require that at all times at least one member of the Appraisal Subcommittee have demonstrated knowledge and competence through licensure, certification, or professional designation within the appraisal profession. (Sec. 1474) Amends the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) to revise requirements that creditors provide loan applicants a copy of the appraisal report used in connection with the loan application secured by a lien on residential real property. Repeals the condition that the loan applicant request the copy. Requires a creditor to furnish the applicant with a copy of all written appraisals and valuations within three days after the closing of the loan. (Sec. 1475) Amends RESPA to permit the standard real estate settlement form to disclose, in the case of an appraisal coordinated by an appraisal management company, the fee paid directly by the company to the appraiser and the company's administration fee. (Sec. 1476) Instructs the Government Accountability Office to study : (1) the effectiveness and impact of certain appraisal methods, models, and distribution channels; (2) the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC); and (3) certain Appraisal Subcommittee functions, including its ability to monitor and enforce state and federal certification requirements and standards. Subtitle G: Mortgage Resolution and Modification - (Sec. 1481) Directs the HUD Secretary to develop a program to ensure protection of current and future tenants and at-risk multifamily properties. Denies persons convicted within the last 10 years of specified crimes involving a mortgage or real estate transaction any eligibility for mortgage assistance from the Making Home Affordable Program authorized or funded by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. (Sec. 1482) Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to revise the supplemental directives and other guidelines for the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) of the Making Home Affordable initiative to require each mortgage servicer participating in HAMP to provide each borrower denied a mortgage modification with all borrower-related and mortgage-related input data used in any net present value (NPV) analyses performed in connection with the mortgage. Directs the Secretary to establish a public website that provides: (1) a calculator for NPV analyses of a mortgage, based on the Secretary's methodology for calculating such value, that mortgagors can use to enter information regarding their own mortgages; and (2) a determination after entering such information of whether such mortgage would be accepted or rejected for modification under the Program. (Sec. 1483) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to revise the HAMP guidelines to make public the data being collected from each participating mortgage servicer and lender. (Sec. 1484) Amends the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act with respect to the requirement that any immediate successor in interest in residential real property pursuant to foreclosure of a federally-related mortgage loan assume that interest subject to certain conditions. Deems the date of a notice of such a foreclosure to be the date upon which complete title to a property is transferred to a successor entity or person as a result of a court order or pursuant to provisions in a mortgage, deed of trust, or security deed. Subtitle H: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 1491) Expresses the sense of Congress that efforts to enhance the terms of residential mortgage credit and practices would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural reforms of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). (Sec. 1492) Directs the Comptroller General to study certain interagency efforts to crackdown on mortgage foreclosure rescue scams and loan modification fraud in order to advise Congress on the risks and vulnerabilities of emerging schemes in the loan modification arena. (Sec. 1493) Amends the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 to require each state to report certain mortgage data. (Sec. 1494) Directs the HUD Secretary to study the effect upon residential mortgage loan foreclosures of: (1) the presence of drywall imported from China between 2004 and the end of 2007; and (2) the availability of property insurance for residential structures in which such drywall is present. (Sec. 1496) Makes necessary sums available to the HUD Secretary to: (1) provide $1 billion in emergency mortgage assistance through the Emergency Homeowners' Relief Fund for such purpose. Amends the Emergency Housing Act of 1975 to permit emergency mortgage assistance if the mortgagor has incurred a substantial reduction in income as a result of involuntary unemployment or underemployment due to medical conditions. Revises requirements for emergency mortgage assistance to replace the maximum amount of $250 per month with an amount determined reasonably necessary to supplement what the homeowner is capable of contributing toward the mortgage payment. Caps the aggregate amount of such assistance to any homeowner at $50,000. Makes the interest rate fixed for the life of an insured loan or credit advance. Limits the interest rate to that generally charged for HUD-insured mortgages on single-family housing. Prohibits the charging of any interest on deferred interest on such a loan or credit advance. Requires the Secretary, in establishing rates, terms, and conditions for loans or advances of credit, to take into account a homeowner's ability to repay such loan or credit advance. Authorizes any eligible homeowner who receives such a grant or credit advance to repay the loan in full, without penalty, by lump sum or by installment payments at any time before it becomes due and payable. Repeals the 40% cap on the total amount of loans and credit advances by a financial institution that may be insured, and the 90% cap on the payment of any single loss claim that may be paid out. Increases from $1.5 billion to $3 billion the cap on the aggregate amount of insured loans and advances, but includes emergency mortgage relief payments in such amount. Directs the Secretary to establish underwriting guidelines or procedures to allocate amounts made available for incurred loans and advances and for emergency relief payments, based on the likelihood that a mortgagor will be able to resume mortgage payments. Repeals the authorization of appropriations for the emergency mortgage relief program, but extends through FY2011 the authority to insure loans and credit advances under the program and to make emergency mortgage relief payments. Repeals the authority of each federal supervisory agency to waive or relax limitations pertaining to their operations with respect to mortgage delinquencies in order to cause or encourage forebearance in residential mortgage loan foreclosures.

(Sec. 1498) Directs the HUD Secretary to establish a grants program to provide a full range of foreclosure legal assistance to low- and moderate-income homeowners and tenants related to home ownership preservation, home foreclosure prevention, and tenancy associated with home foreclosure. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2012. Title XV: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 1501) Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the United States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to: (1) evaluate, before consideration by the IMF Board of Executive Directors, any proposal to make a loan to a country whose public debt exceeds its gross domestic product if that country is not eligible for assistance from the International Development Association; and (2) oppose the proposal if such evaluation indicates the proposed loan is unlikely to be repaid in full. Directs the Secretary to assess annually to Congress the likelihood that loans made pursuant to such proposals will be repaid in full. (Sec. 1502) Expresses the sense of Congress that the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) helps finance conflict characterized by extreme levels of violence in the eastern DRC , particularly sexual- and gender-based violence, and contributes to an emergency humanitarian situation therein, warranting certain disclosures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the SEC to issue regulations requiring persons for which conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by that person to make annual disclosures of whether any such conflict minerals originated in the DRC or an adjoining country. Requires the report, regarding any minerals that did originate in the DRC or an adjoining country, to describe: (1) due diligence measures taken on the source and chain of custody of such minerals; and (2) the products manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, that are not DRC conflict free. Defines \"DRC conflict free\" as products that do not contain minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country. Instructs the Secretary of State to: (1) submit to Congress a strategy to address the linkages between human rights abuses, armed groups, mining of conflict minerals, and commercial products; (2) produce and update periodically a map, available to the public, of mineral-rich zones, trade routes, and areas under the control of armed groups in the DRC and adjoining countries (\"Conflict Minerals Map\"); and (3) publish in the Federal Register a notice of intent to declare a mineral a conflict mineral. Directs the Comptroller General to assess for Congress: (1) the rate of sexual- and gender-based violence in war-torn areas of the DRC and adjoining countries; and (2) the effectiveness of these newly required reports in promoting peace and security in such countries. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to assess for Congress the accuracy of independent private sector audits and other due diligence processes. (Sec. 1503) Requires securities issuers required to report to the SEC that are coal or other mine operators, or that have subsidiaries that are mine operators, to include in periodic reports to the SEC, among other things, the total number per mine of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard for which the operator received a citation from the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Requires reports, also, of imminent danger orders and written notices of patterns of violations of such standards, or the potential to have such a pattern. (Sec. 1504) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the SEC to: (1) promulgate final rules requiring each resource extraction issuer to include in its annual report information, in an interactive data format, detailing any payment made by the issuer, a subsidiary, or an entity under its control to a foreign government or the federal government for the purpose of the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals; and (2) make a compilation of such information publicly accessible online. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 1505) Directs the Comptroller General to assess for Congress: (1) the relative independence, effectiveness, and expertise of presidentially appointed inspectors general and inspectors general of designated federal entities; and (2) the effects on independence of the amendments to the Inspector General Act of 1978 made by this Act. (Sec. 1506) Directs the FDIC to evaluate for Congress: (1) the definition of core deposits for the purpose of calculating the insurance premiums of banks; (2) the potential impact on the Deposit Insurance Fund of revising the definitions of brokered deposits and core deposits to better distinguish between them; (3) the differences between core deposits and brokered deposits and their role in the economy and the domestic banking sector; (4) the potential stimulative effect on local economies of redefining core deposits; and (5) the competitive parity between large institutions and community banks that could result from redefining core deposits. Title XVI: Section 1256 Contracts - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from the definition of a Section 1256 contract any interest rate swap, currency swap, basis swap, interest rate cap, interest rate floor, commodity swap, equity swap, equity index swap, credit default swap, or similar agreement. (Thus shields such instruments from treatment as sold for its fair market value [marked to market] on the last business day of the taxable year for capital gains or loss taxation purposes)."
