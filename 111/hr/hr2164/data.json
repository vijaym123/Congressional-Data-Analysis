Increases the maximum total federal funding for such a project from $75 million to $100 million, and the maximum total estimated net capital cost from $250 million to $300 million. Revises selection criteria for such projects to require that a project be justified based on a review of its effect on local economic development and land use (as under current law), as well as travel patterns and greenhouse gas reduction potential. Repeals the requirement for review also of a project's cost effectiveness. Requires the Secretary, in making a project justification, to determine the reduction in per capita auto travel demand and in greenhouse gas emissions that will result from the completed project. Repeals certain other requirements."
