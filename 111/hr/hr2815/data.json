Defines \"criminal street gang\" and \"predicate gang crime\" for purposes of this Act. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend its sentencing guidelines to provide an enhancement for crimes committed in furtherance or in aid of criminal street gangs. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) expand the Project Safe Neighborhoods program to require U.S. attorneys to identify, investigate, and prosecute significant criminal street gangs operating within their districts and to coordinate anti-gang activities; and (2) require the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to increase funding for the Safe Streets Program and to support criminal street gang enforcement teams. Authorizes the Attorney General to hire 94 additional assistant U.S. attorneys for the Project Safe Neighborhoods program."
