    "text": "SBIR and STTR Enhancement Act - Amends the Small Business Act to direct each federal agency that is required to establish a small business innovation research (SBIR) program to: (1) issue research topic solicitations at least twice a year; and (2) make a final decision on topic proposals within 90 days, unless the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) determines that a decision may be extended to 180 days. Requires the Administrator to submit to the congressional small business committees a list of small businesses that, for the preceding five-year period, received 15 or more first phase SBIR awards but no second phase awards. Requires each federal agency conducting an SBIR program to engage with such awardees and develop performance measures for awardee progression in the SBIR program. Provides funding for SBIR administrative, oversight, and contract processing costs. Requires a Comptroller General audit on how federal agencies calculate SBIR and STTR (Small Business Technology Transfer) extramural research budgets. Directs each federal agency conducting an SBIR or STTR program to establish and maintain program evaluation and technology utilization databases. Establishes an Interagency SBIR/STTR Policy Committee. Authorizes each federal agency with an SBIR program to \"fast track\" phase two awards. Increases SBIR and STTR award levels. Provides express authority for agencies to award sequential phase two awards for SBIR-funded projects. Allows a federal agency to provide a second phase award to a small business only if the business has been provided an award for the first phase or has completed first phase requirements despite not having been provided a first phase award."
