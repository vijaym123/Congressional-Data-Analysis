    "as": "Reported to House amended",

    "text": "Satellite Home Viewer Reauthorization Act of 2009 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to extend to December 31, 2014, the termination of provisions allowing satellite retransmission of network station signals (without the station's consent) to a subscriber who is located outside of the local market of the station and resides in an unserved household. (Sec. 3) Allows a satellite carrier to retransmit the signals of a significantly viewed station located outside of the local market in which a subscriber is located, but: (1) only for subscribers receiving local-into-local service; or (2) regarding high definition (HD) signals, only if the carrier also retransmits available HD signals of a station in the local market of the subscriber and affiliated with the same network. (Sec. 4) Allows a carrier to retransmit HD signals to a reception antenna separate from the one for non-HD signals. Revises: (1) the satellite carrier secondary transmission rules applicable to non-grandfathered subscribers who are eligible to receive a distant signal; and (2) special rules for distant digital signals. Allows a satellite carrier to provide the signals of both a local and a distant station of the same network to an eligible subscriber only if the distant station's signal is generally broadcast simultaneously with, or later than, the prime time network programming of the local station. Revises requirements regarding: (1) a point-to-point model to predict the ability of individual locations, through the use of a conventional, stationary, outdoor rooftop receiving antenna, to receive signals in accordance with a specified signal intensity standard; and (2) on-location testing. Requires a study and report to Congress on whether specified testing procedures or such standard should be revised to take into account the types of antennas that are available to, and used by, consumers. (Sec. 7) Prohibits construing this Act or its amendments from affecting the definitions of \"program related\" and \"primary video\" in the Communications Act of 1934 or in any regulations promulgated under that Act. (Sec. 8) Requires a report to Congress on: (1) the number of households in a state that receive local broadcast stations from a station of license that is located in a different state; (2) the extent to which consumers have access to in-state broadcast programming; and (3) whether there are alternatives to the use of designated market areas to define local markets that would provide more consumers with in-state broadcast programming. (Sec. 9) Requires eligible satellite carriers that provide any local-into-local secondary transmissions in HD to carry the HD signals of qualified noncommercial educational television stations located in that local market. Defines \"eligible satellite carrier\" as any satellite carrier that is not a party to a carriage contract with a qualified noncommercial educational television station as of enactment of this Act."
