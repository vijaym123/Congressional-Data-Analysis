  <summary>1/27/2010--Introduced.
Fairness for American Students Act - Amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to make illegal aliens ineligible for any postsecondary education benefit that results from their residence within a state or political subdivision unless every citizen and national of this country is entitled to such benefit regardless of their place of residence or the location of the school from which they graduated. Allows any U.S. citizen or national that is enrolled in a postsecondary school to commence a civil action against a school or state education official to enforce their compliance with this Act's requirement and obtain appropriate relief, including the in-state tuition rate. Prohibits federal agencies from providing financial assistance to postsecondary schools that provide benefits to illegal aliens in contravention of this Act.</summary>
