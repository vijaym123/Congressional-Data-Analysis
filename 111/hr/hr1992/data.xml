Immigration Fraud Prevention Act of 2009 - Amends the federal criminal code to subject a person to fine, imprisonment, or both, who: (1) willfully and knowingly executes a scheme in connection with any federal immigration law-related matter to defraud a person, or to obtain money or anything else of value from a person by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises; or (2) willfully, knowingly, and falsely represents that such person is an attorney or an accredited representative in any federal immigration law-related matter. Directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) use the Executive Office of Immigration Review to investigate such immigration fraud crimes; and (2) educate immigrant communities about who may provide legal services and representation in immigration proceedings. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require that: (1) aliens in removal proceedings be provided with a description of who may represent them, including notice that immigration consultants, visa consultants, and other unauthorized individuals may not provide such representation; and (2) the Attorney General provide for lists of persons who are prohibited from providing representation in immigration proceedings.</summary>
