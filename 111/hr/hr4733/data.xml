  <summary>3/2/2010--Introduced.
Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act - Declares that it is U.S. policy that the raising of livestock for food production shall be consistent with the basic principles of animal welfare. Prohibits a federal agency from purchasing any food product derived from a pig during pregnancy, a calf raised for veal, or an egg-laying hen used or intended for use in food production (covered animal) unless that animal, during the entire period covered by that definition, was provided adequate space to stand up, lie down, turn around freely, and fully extend all limbs. Exempts a covered animal: (1) during lawful transport; (2) during the slaughter of the animal in compliance with the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958 and other applicable law and regulations; (3) in lawful rodeo exhibitions, state or county fair exhibitions, or other similar exhibitions; (4) in lawful scientific or agricultural research; (5) while undergoing an examination, test, treatment, or operation for individualized veterinary purposes to improve the animal's well-being; or (6) in the case of a pig during pregnancy, during the seven-day period immediately before the date the pig is expected to give birth. Provides that nothing in this Act shall modify, limit, or repeal any law or preempt any state or local law.</summary>
