    "text": "Longline Catcher Processor Subsector Single Fishery Cooperative Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, upon the request of eligible members of the longline catcher processor subsector holding at least 80 percent of the licenses issued for that subsector, to approve a single fishery cooperative for the longline catcher processor subsector in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI). Requires an approved cooperative to include a limitation prohibiting any eligible member from harvesting a total of more than 20% of the Pacific cod available to be harvested in the longline catcher processor subsector, the violation of which is subject to the penalties under section the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Excepts from such limitation harvest amounts from quota assigned explicitly to a western Alaska community development quota group. Provides procedures for the submission of a contract by the longline catcher processor subsector to implement the single fishery cooperative and Department of Justice review. Sets forth BSAI Pacific cod harvest and prohibited species allocations for a single fishery cooperative approved under this Act and eligible members that operate in a non-cooperative limited access fishery. Authorizes the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to recommend for approval by the Secretary harvest limitations of Pacific cod by the longline catcher processor subsector in the Western Gulf of Alaska and the Central Gulf of Alaska necessary to protect coastal communities and other Gulf of Alaska participants from potential competitive advantages provided by this Act to the longline catcher processor subsector."
