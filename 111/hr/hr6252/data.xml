Allows certain exceptions to such export ban. Defines "restricted electronic waste" to include electronic equipment, such as computers, televisions, printers, copiers, video game systems, telephones, and similar used electronic products, that contain cathode ray tubes, batteries, switches, capacitors, and other parts containing lead, cadmium, mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, chromium, beryllium, or other toxic ingredients.</summary>
