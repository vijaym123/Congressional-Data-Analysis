  <summary>6/23/2010--Passed House amended.
Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, before making a first purchase (including a commitment to purchase) under the Small Business Lending Fund Program under the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010, to certify under oath to the Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury that the purchase-decision process has been designed so that each purchase decision is made solely on the basis of economic fundamentals and not because of any political considerations.</summary>
