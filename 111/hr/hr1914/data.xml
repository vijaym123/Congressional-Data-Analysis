Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to provide for the suspension of each provision of the Act with respect to a federal or state agency that manages a federal river basin if the Secretary of the Army (acting through the Chief of Engineers) or the governor of the relevant state determines that: (1) a drought is in effect in the region in which the basin is located; and (2) such drought presents a threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the region's population. Terminates such a suspension on the date the Secretary or governor determines the drought is no longer in effect.</summary>
