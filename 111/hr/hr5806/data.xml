  <summary>7/21/2010--Introduced.
Eat Local Foods Act - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to provide grants to states, by the beginning of each school year (beginning with the 2012-2013 school year), for use in providing school food authorities with local food credits that represent up to 10% of the total value of the commodity assistance (or cash payments in lieu thereof) that the authority would be eligible to receive for the school year. Subtracts the value of the food credit from the amount of commodity assistance (or cash payments in lieu thereof) that a school food authority would otherwise receive. Requires school food authorities to use their credits to purchase locally or regionally produced agricultural food products to serve in the school lunch program.</summary>
