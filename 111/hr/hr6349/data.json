Requires the Secretary to make publicly available the comparison of the cost of performance of each DOD function so converted. Allows any small business that performs a DOD function that is converted to performance by DOD civilian employees and, by reason of that conversion, loses 33% or more of its revenue generated through contracts or 33% or more of its employees, to appeal such conversion to the inspector general of the military department concerned or to the Secretary."
