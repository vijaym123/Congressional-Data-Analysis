Sets forth complaint filing procedures with the Secretary of Labor regarding such retaliation. Requires the Secretary to investigate and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint has merit and notify in writing the complainant and the employer regarding the Secretary's findings. Authorizes a civil action to require compliance with this Act. Requires employers to: (1) post a notice approved by the Secretary of Labor explaining employee rights and remedies under this Act in a conspicuous location in the place of employment where employees frequent; (2) provide training to employees about their rights under this Act within 30 days of employment, and at least once annually; and (3) provide employees with a card containing a toll free telephone number at the Department of Labor to get information or file a complaint. Directs the Secretary of Labor, within 30 days after enactment of this Act, to designate agency officials to receive, investigate, and adjudicate complaints concerning violations under this Act."
