  <summary>7/13/2010--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to provide that reasonable service charges applicable to federal entities for water pollution include the same reasonable fees or assessments for stormwater management applicable to any nongovernmental entity. Provides that such a fee or assessment shall not be considered to be a tax or other levy subject to an assertion of sovereign immunity and may be paid using appropriated funds.</summary>
