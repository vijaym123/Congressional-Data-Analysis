  <summary>3/11/2010--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to convey and quitclaim all interest of the United States in and to a parcel of real property, including improvements, located at 4500 Glenwood Drive in Riverside, California, and administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, to the Riverside Corona Conservation District. Requires the Conservation District to pay to the Secretary the appraised market value of the land as unimproved land, excluding all improvements other than normal utility connections such as sewer and water taps. Prohibits reservation by the Secretary of any future interest in the property to be conveyed, except that which may be acceptable to the Conservation District. Requires the Secretary, notwithstanding the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or the Solid Waste Disposal Act, in conveying the property, to only meet the disclosure requirements for hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, without otherwise being required to remediate or abate any such releases, including petroleum and petroleum derivatives.</summary>
