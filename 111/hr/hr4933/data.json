Provides for an evaluation of the Global Health Strategy by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academics or another appropriate entity. Authorizes the President to provide assistance to developing countries to improve health services delivery. Authorizes the President to establish a Global Health Workforce Initiative to provide technical and direct financial assistance to support the recruitment, training, and equitable distribution of skilled health workers in at least 12 developing countries. Directs the President to transmit to Congress and make publicly available a five-year strategy for implementing the Initiative. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should: (1) address the urgent shortage of U.S. health professionals without exacerbating the health professional shortage in developing countries; and (2) pursue trade and investment policies that support United States Global Health Strategy goals. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct: (1) the U.S. Executive Director at each international financial institution to oppose any loan, grant, or policy that would result in the imposition of user fees or service charges on poor individuals in connection with such institution's financing programs for primary education or primary health care; and (2) the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to oppose any loan or program that would not exempt government spending on health care, health infrastructure, and education from national budget caps and restraints, hiring and wage ceilings, and other IMF-imposed limits."
