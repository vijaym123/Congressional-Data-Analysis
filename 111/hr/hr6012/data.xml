Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), for the purpose of reducing the number of undiagnosed seniors with diabetes or prediabetes, to: (1) review utilization of diabetes screening benefits under HHS programs to identify and address any existing problems with regard to such utilization and related data collection mechanisms; and (2) make recommendations on outreach activities carried out by the Secretary to ensure awareness among seniors and health care providers of such diabetes screening benefits and the advantages of knowing one's diabetic or prediabetic status for the purpose of self-management. Directs the Secretary to carry out this section in consultation with: (1) the heads of appropriate health agencies and offices in HHS; and (2) entities with an interest in diabetes, including industry, voluntary health organizations (such as diabetes advocacy groups and other related stakeholders), trade associations, and professional societies.
