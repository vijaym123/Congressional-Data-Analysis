Requires the Director of the Center for Mental Health Services to designate a Deputy Director for Older Adult Mental Health Services to develop and implement initiatives to address the mental health needs of older adults. Includes representatives of older adults or their families and geriatric mental health professionals on the Advisory Council for the Center. Directs the Secretary to give special consideration to providing treatment for older adults with substance abuse disorders when developing program priorities for addressing priority substance abuse treatment needs of regional and national significance. Requires state plans for community mental health services grants to describe: (1) the state's outreach to, and services for, older individuals, individuals who are homeless, and individuals living in rural areas; and (2) how community-based services will be provided to these individuals."
