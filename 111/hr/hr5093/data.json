Sets forth educational background requirements for program participants. Requires program participants to enter into an agreement to: (1) obtain certification or licensing as an elementary, secondary, vocational, or technical school teacher, and to become a highly qualified teacher; and (2) accept an offer of full-time employment as an elementary, secondary, vocational, or technical school teacher for at least three school years and commit to teaching science, technology, engineering, or mathematics after obtaining such certification or licensing. Directs the Secretary to provide program participants with: (1) a stipend for use in obtaining certification or licensing; or (2) a larger bonus if they agree to perform their service in high-need schools. Requires the Secretary to establish an Advisory Board to oversee the program."
