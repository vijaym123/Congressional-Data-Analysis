Modifies the first-time homebuyer tax credit by: (1) allowing all purchasers of a principal residence, not just first-time homebuyers, to claim such credit; (2) eliminating the requirement to repay credit amounts over a 15-year period; and (3) imposing a recapture requirement for taxpayers who dispose of a residence within 36 months after purchase. Extends such credit through December 31, 2009."
