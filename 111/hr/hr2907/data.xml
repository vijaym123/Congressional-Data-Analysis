  <summary>6/16/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) to allow recipients of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds to repay such funds if they will be well capitalized after such repayment, as determined by the federal banking agency having supervisory authority over such recipients. Eliminates the requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury liquidate warrants associated with repaid TARP funds at the current market price.</summary>
