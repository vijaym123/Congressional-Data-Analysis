Conditions the availability of: (1) FY2010 appropriations for a voluntary contribution to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) upon a determination by the Secretary of State that Israel is not being denied IAEA participation; and (2) certain appropriations to support a Palestinian state upon a determination by the Secretary that the Palestinian governing entity has demonstrated a commitment to peaceful co-existence with Israel and is taking appropriate counterterrorism measures.
