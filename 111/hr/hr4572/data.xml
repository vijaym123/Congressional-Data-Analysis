  <summary>2/2/2010--Introduced.
Amends the Clean Air Act to exclude from the definition of "air pollutant" any of the following solely on the basis of its effect on global climate change: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from implementing activities relating to the inclusion of international indirect land use change in the implementation of the renewable fuel program. Excludes indirect emissions from international land use changes from the definition of lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Requires the Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture (currently, the Administrator) to determine the aggregate quantity of GHG emissions in liefecycyle GHG emissions related to the full fuel lifecycle. Amends the Clean Air Act to redefine "renewable biomass" as: (1) materials, pre-commercial thinnings, or invasive species from certain National Forest System land and public lands that are byproducts of preventive treatments that are removed to reduce hazardous fuels, reduce or contain disease or insect infestation, or restore ecosystem health, that would not otherwise be used for higher-value products, and that are harvested in accordance with specified requirements for old-growth forests and large tree retention; or (2) any organic matter that is available on a renewable or recurring basis from nonfederal land or land belonging to an Indian or Indian tribe that is held in trust by the United States or subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States, including specified renewable plant material and waste material.</summary>
