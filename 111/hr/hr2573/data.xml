  <summary>5/21/2009--Introduced.
Atomic Veterans Relief Act - Includes within the definition of a "radiation-risk activity" for purposes of eligibility for veterans' disability compensation the exposure at any time to ionizing radiation from undetonated weapons or residual contamination resulting from a nuclear detonation. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to include in regulations pertaining to the service-connection of veterans' disabilities additional provisions to ensure, in the case of a claim by a radiation-exposed veteran for service-connection of a nonpresumptive disability, that the procedures for establishment of whether the disability is service-connected and which require the mathematical calculation of the level of exposure of the veteran to the ionizing radiation (commonly referred to as dose reconstruction) also require the Secretary to, among other things: (1) determine the facts and circumstances of the exposure while presuming the veteran's recitation of the event as correct, unless clear and convincing evidence establishes otherwise; and (2) obtain a reconstructed dose based on specific facts and circumstances established by the evidence.</summary>
