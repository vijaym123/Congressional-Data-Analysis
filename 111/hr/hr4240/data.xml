  <summary>12/8/2009--Introduced.
Establishes a six-month grace period following enactment of this Act during which otherwise qualifying durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers that do not yet meet Medicare accreditation and surety bond requirements must meet them. Requires such suppliers to be treated as having met the requirements between the effective date of the requirements and the date on which they first meet them, so long as they actually do meet them within six months after enactment of this Act.</summary>
