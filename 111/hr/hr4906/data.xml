ARPA-E Reauthorization Act of 2010 - Amends the America COMPETES Act to instruct the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) of the Department of Energy (DOE) to achieve the goals of ARPA-E through energy technology projects which: (1) identify and promote revolutionary advances in applied sciences; and (2) promote the commercial application of advanced energy technologies. Includes as a responsibility of the Director of ARPA-E the research and development of advanced manufacturing process and technologies for the domestic manufacturing of novel energy technologies. Requires the Director to: (1) make awards through grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, cash prizes, and other transactions to carry out ARPA-E; and (2) establish within ARPA-E a staff to enable ARPA-E to carry out its responsibilities separately and distinctly from the operations of the rest of DOE. Includes as responsibilities of program directors the identification of: (1) innovative cost-sharing arrangements for ARPA-E projects; and (2) mechanisms for commercial application of successful energy technology development projects. Authorizes the Director to select exceptional early career and senior scientific, legal, business, and technical personnel to serve as fellows to work at ARPA-E for two-year terms. Extends the deadlines for submission of the strategic vision roadmaps to Congress. Instructs the Director to seek opportunities to partner with purchasing and procurement programs of federal agencies to demonstrate energy technologies resulting from activities funded through ARPA-E. Authorizes the Director to convene events that further ARPA-E objectives, including events that facilitate discussion of the commercial application of energy technologies. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2020 to the Director to carry out the purposes of ARPA-E.</summary>
