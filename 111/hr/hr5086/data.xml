  <summary>4/20/2010--Introduced.
Online Disclosure for Access to Campaign Funds Act of 2010 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require the treasurer of each authorized political committee to establish a separate account for the committee consisting exclusively of contributions received by or on behalf of it, and to deposit each contribution into the account immediately upon receipt. Prohibits the use of amounts in such account to make disbursements by or on behalf of the committee, allowing their use only for transfers to other committee accounts of the committee. Requires the treasurer of an authorized committee to ensure that the balance of the account is equal to the total amounts deposited into it reduced by the total amount of all contributions deposited into it with respect to which the treasurer has identified the contributor on a publicly accessible Internet site of the committee.</summary>
