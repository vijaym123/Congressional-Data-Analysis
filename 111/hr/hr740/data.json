Provides for an exception if the Secretary concerned determines that seismic activity would not have any significant impact on any portion of the proposed development under the lease. Prohibits such Secretary from omitting a revocation provision from a lease allowed under this exception. Requires revocation of previously-approved leases in such zones unless a lease is under substantial construction or the Secretary determines a lease should not be revoked."
