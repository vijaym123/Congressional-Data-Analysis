    "text": "Sex Offender Notification of International Travel Act - Amends the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act to require sex offenders required to register under such Act to notify their residential jurisdictions of their intent to travel from the United States to another country, regardless of the duration of the travel. Requires the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), to develop an international travel notification form to obtain information about sex offenders traveling outside the United States, including each such offender's name, address, social security number, email addresses, citizenship, passport or passport card number, and travel itinerary and the purpose of the trip. Establishes: (1) a Cyber Crimes Center (CCC) in the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office of DHS to address criminal acts crossing U.S. borders through cyberspace; and (2) the Child Exploitation Investigations Center within the CCC to coordinate all agency child exploitation initiatives relating to child exploitation, child trafficking, and forced child labor. Authorizes the CCC to create and advance public awareness campaigns to further its mission. Directs the Attorney General, in consultation with the DHS Secretary, to conduct research and development activities for the prevention and investigation of child exploitation crimes. Amends the federal criminal code to extend the authority to issue administrative subpoenas in federal offenses involving the sexual exploitation or abuse of children to the DHS Secretary and the Postmaster General."
