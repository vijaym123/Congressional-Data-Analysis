Educating Entrepreneurs through Today's Technology Act - Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to contract with qualified vendors for entrepreneurial training content, the development of communications technology that can distribute such content throughout the United States, and the establishment of a nationwide, online network for the exchange of peer-to-peer technical assistance. Directs the Administrator to ensure that the content developed is: (1) timely and relevant to entrepreneurial development and can be successfully communicated remotely to an audience through the use of technology; and (2) able to be distributed to small businesses, home-based businesses, small business development centers, women's business centers, veterans business centers, the SBA, and network entrepreneurs throughout the United States and its territories. Requires a report from the Administrator to Congress on SBA progress in implementing this Act. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
