  <summary>5/6/2010--Introduced.
Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to prohibit the development, recognition, or implementation of any guideline or other standard under any provision of PPACA from being construed to establish the standard of care or duty of care owed by health care providers to their patients in any medical malpractice action or claim. Declares that nothing in PPACA shall be construed to modify or impair state law governing legal standards or procedures used in medical malpractice cases, including the authority of a state to make or implement such law.</summary>
