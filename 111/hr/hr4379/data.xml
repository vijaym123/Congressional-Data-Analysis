  <summary>12/16/2009--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned, as a condition of each contract awarded in connection with a military construction or family housing project, to require the contractor (and any appropriate subcontractor) to comply with workforce licensing requirements imposed by the state and other jurisdictions in which the project is conducted for all employees of the contractor (and any appropriate subcontractor) who work at the project location. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to waive such requirement on a case-by-case basis for national security purposes.</summary>
