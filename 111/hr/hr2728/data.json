Directs the Law Library to electronically catalog and archive material in its collections in a nonproprietary and nondiscriminatory format. Requires the separation of the salaries and expenses of the Law Library from other salaries and expenses of the Library of Congress in the preparation of the annual budget for the Library of Congress. Establishes the William Orton Law Library Support Program to provide enhanced or special services and programs for the Law Library and otherwise support the mission of the Law Library. Allows the Librarian of Congress (the Librarian) to carry out the Program through agreements and partnerships with other government and private entities, including the American Association of Law Libraries and the American Bar Association (ABA). Permits the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board and the Librarian to accept private donations in support of the Program. Makes any accepted donations subject to disbursement by the Librarian only upon the recommendation of the Law Librarian, with an exception. Establishes in the Treasury a separate account for the Program. Limits the use of account funds only to the Law Librarian to carry out such Program. Authorizes annual appropriations to the Library of Congress for the deposit into such account of an amount equal to 40% of the amount of donations accepted by the Board in support of such Program, in addition to any other amounts authorized for the Law Library. Designates the Law Library as the \"National Law Library.\""
