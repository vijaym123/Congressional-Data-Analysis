    "text": "Energy Education Loan Forgiveness Act of 2010 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to provide student loan forgiveness under the Federal Family Education Loan, Direct Loan, and Perkins Loans programs to individuals who have been employed for at least one year after this Act's enactment as full-time skilled energy workers in advanced energy industries. Limits the maximum amount of such loan forgiveness to $2,000 after the first year of a skilled energy worker's employment, with incremental increases after each of the following four years, reaching $5,000 of the loan obligation of the borrower outstanding after the completion of the fifth year. Includes as advanced energy industries those involved in: (1) alternative energy; (2) nuclear energy; (3) energy efficient construction, retrofitting, and design; (4) sustainable energy technologies; (5) water and energy conservation; (6) recycling and waste reduction; (7) advanced agriculture; (8) carbon sequestration and storage; (9) natural gas drilling; and (10) clean coal production."
