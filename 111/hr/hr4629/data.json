Outlines SPV application requirements. Allows, under the collateral support program, a qualified manufacturer that wishes to receive a bank loan but has insufficient collateral to ask the bank to seek collateral loan support from the SPV. Prohibits an SPV from providing more than $20 million in collateral support to any one manufacturer. Requires manufacturers to be charged a fee for such support. Allows, under the loan participation program, a qualified manufacturer that wishes to receive a bank loan but would not otherwise qualify for the loan to ask the bank to seek participation for such loan from the SPV. Prohibits an SPV from providing more than $20 million in participation support to any one manufacturer. Requires manufacturers to be charged a fee for such support. Requires: (1) periodic reports from such banks to participating SPVs; and (2) quarterly reports from the Secretary to Congress on participants in and impacts of the support and participation programs."
