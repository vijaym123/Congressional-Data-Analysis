Requires the Commission to focus on the use of funds to: (1) create new jobs in industries that produce renewable energy; (2) preserve jobs in existing, previously carbon-intensive industries; (3) assist working families with any increases in the costs of energy, transportation, housing, health care, food, and other necessities that result from federal laws designed to limit GHG emissions; and (4) assist small businesses with increases in energy costs that result from such laws, including costs relating to transportation, facilities, and equipment."
