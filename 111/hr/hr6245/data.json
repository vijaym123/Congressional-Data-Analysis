Requires the Attorney General to: (1) make a copy of the electronic recording of a custodial interrogation available to the individual who was subject to such interrogation; (2) identify and catalogue any such recording; and (3) preserve such recording until all related proceedings are final or the applicable statute of limitations has expired."
