  <summary>11/19/2009--Introduced.
Increasing Access to Voluntary Screening for HIV/AIDS and STIs Act of 2009 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to: (1) allow a higher payment to states for routine HIV/AIDS and STI (sexually transmitted infections recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) screening services; and (2) require coverage of low-income HIV/AIDS infected individuals. Directs the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to adopt a broad policy for voluntary HIV/AIDS and STI screening for all Medicare beneficiaries who are 13 years of age or older. Authorizes the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to federally qualified health centers to provide voluntary HIV/AIDS and STI screening. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require group and individual health plans to provide routine HIV/AIDS and STI screening. Requires the Director of the CDC to: (1) track national HIV/AIDS and STI screening trends and the burdens of HIV/AIDS and STIs among people with disabilities; (2) make sex education materials that promote voluntary screening for HIV/AIDS and STIs accessible to the deaf and hearing loss community and to people with intellectual disabilities; (3) ensure that national screening guidelines for cervical cancer state that women who have sex with women should have the same guidelines as women who have sex only with men; and (4) improve information collection concerning the transmission, morbidity, and screening for HIV/AIDS and STIs in transgender communities.</summary>
