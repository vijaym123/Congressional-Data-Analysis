National Women's History Museum Act of 2009 - (Sec. 3) Directs the Administrator of General Services (GSA) to convey, by quitclaim deed, to the National Women's History Museum, Inc. (the Museum) specified property in the District of Columbia, on terms which the Administrator deems appropriate. Requires the terms and conditions of the conveyance to address, among other things, mitigation of developmental impacts to existing federal buildings and structures, security concerns, and operational protocols for development and use of the property. Requires the purchase price for the property to be its market value based on its highest and best use, as determined by an independent appraisal. Requires the appraisal to assume that the property does not contain hazardous substances which require response action. Requires the purchase price to be paid into the Federal Buildings Fund and permits the Administrator to use the proceeds for any lawful purpose consistent with existing authorities granted to the Administrator. Requires specified congressional committees (the committees) to be provided with 30 days advance written notice of any expenditure of the proceeds. Requires the property to be dedicated for use as a site for a national women's history museum for a 99-year period. Provides for the reversion of the property to the United States without any obligation for repayment of any amount of the purchase price if: (1) it is not used as a site for a national women's history museum during the 99-year period; and (2) the Museum has not commenced construction of a museum facility on such property in a five-year period, other than for reasons beyond the Museum's control. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Administrator to contract, in an amount not to exceed the purchase price for the property, with the Museum or an affiliate of the Museum to perform response actions required on the property pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). Credits any costs incurred by the Museum or an affiliate to the purchase price. Prohibits anything in this Act or any amendment made by this Act affecting or limiting compliance with any environmental laws. (Sec. 5) Requires the Museum to bear all costs associated with complying with the provisions of this Act, including studies and reports, relocating tenants, and mitigating impacts to existing federal buildings and structures resulting from the development of the property. (Sec. 6) Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as limiting or affecting the authority or responsibilities of the National Capital Planning Commission or the Commission of Fine Arts. Requires the Administrator to cooperate with the Museum on zoning or other land use matters. Bars the Administrator from being required to incur any costs for such cooperation. (Sec. 7) Requires the Museum to submit annual reports to the Administrator and the committees on the development and construction activities of the Museum until the end of the five-year period after conveyance of the property or substantial completion of the museum facility, whichever is later.</summary>
