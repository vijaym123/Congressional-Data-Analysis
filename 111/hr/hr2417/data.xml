  <summary>5/14/2009--Introduced.
Identity Protection Act of 2009 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to prohibit the use of Social Security account numbers on identification cards issued by the U.S. government in connection with benefits under SSA titles XVIII (Medicare), XIX (Medicaid), and XXI (Children's Health Insurance Program) (CHIP, formerly known as SCHIP). Declares the sense of Congress that private entities should not: (1) use Social Security account numbers as a method identifying individuals on documents made available to the public or on personal identification cards; or (2) include on any such document or card a magnetic strip, bar code, or other means of communication which conveys such number (or a derivative).</summary>
