  <summary>3/17/2009--Introduced.
Preexisting Condition Patient Protection Act of 2009 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit a group health plan from: (1) imposing any preexisting condition exclusion; or (2) providing for an affiliation period for coverage offered by a health maintenance organization (HMO). Defines an "affiliation period" as a period of time before health insurance coverage becomes effective. Requires each health insurance issuer offering coverage in the group market in a state to accept every employer in the state that applies for such coverage. Prohibits preexisting condition exclusions for individual health insurance coverage. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress on the impact of this Act on health benefits coverage. Authorizes the Secretary to request claims data, enrollee data, and other appropriate information from group health plans and health insurance issuers. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the impact of this Act and other relevant federal laws on the reduction in the number of uninsured and underinsured individuals and on the affordability of coverage.</summary>
