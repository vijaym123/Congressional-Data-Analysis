    "text": "Adult Day Achievement Center Enhancement Act - Requires the Assistant Secretary for Aging to initiate a comprehensive survey of current adult day programs that provide care and support to individuals living with multiple sclerosis, to include: (1) identifying ongoing successful multiple sclerosis adult day programs (MSADPs) and other similar adult day programs; and (2) developing a set of best practices to help guide the establishment and replication of additional successful MSADPs and other similar adult day programs. Directs the Assistant Secretary to establish a competitive grant program for awarding grants annually to fund MSADPs and other similar adult day programs. Defines an MSADP as an adult day program that provides comprehensive and effective care and support services to individuals living with multiple sclerosis and their family caregivers and that may assist participants in ways that: (1) maintain or improve their functional abilities or otherwise help them adjust to their changing functional abilities; (2) prevent the onset of complications associated with severe forms of the disease; (3) promote alternatives to placement in nursing homes; (4) reduce the strain on family caregivers taking care of a family member with multiple sclerosis; or (5) focus on supporting the emotional, social, and intellectual needs of a younger adult population."
