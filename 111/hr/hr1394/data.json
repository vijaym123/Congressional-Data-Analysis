Authorizes Corps programs to implement activities that: (1) meet an identifiable public need with specific emphasis on projects in support of energy conservation, infrastructure and transportation improvement, and emergency operations; and (2) provide opportunities for youth and young adults to be trained for careers related to such activities, including those in the emerging field of green collar jobs. Limits enrollment of program participants to: (1) individuals between 18 and 25 years of age, in general; (2) individuals between 14 and 21 for summer programs; and (3) a limited number of special Corpsman over 25 with special skills. Requires Corps programs that receive assistance to ensure that at least 50% of the participants are economically disadvantage youth."
