Directs the Bureau of Prisons to report to Congress: (1) within one year on Bureau policies and procedures to provide testing, treatment, and prevention education programs for hepatitis and other diseases transmitted through sexual activity and intravenous drug use; and (2) annually on the incidence among inmates of diseases transmitted through sexual activity and intravenous drug use, including specific information on HIV/AIDS.Authorizes appropriations."
