Permits the succession list to include only such officers that are: (1) eligible to the office of President under the Constitution; (2) not under impeachment by the House of Representatives; and (3) except for the designated House or Senate leader, appointed to the office involved, by and with the Senate's advice and consent, prior to succession. Expresses the sense of Congress regarding: (1) to whom electors should give their votes in the event of the death or incapacity of nominees for President and Vice President; and (2) nomination by a President who will not be serving a succeeding term of individuals selected by the President-elect for offices that fall within the line of succession, confirmation of such nominees by the Senate, and the signing and delivery of commissions to all such approved nominations, before the inauguration of the President-elect, to ensure continuity of government."
