    "text": "American Textile Technology Innovation and Research for Exportation (ATTIRE) Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a grant program to fund textile research and innovation in the U.S. textile and fiber products industry and to promote increased U.S. textile exports. Limits eligibility under such grant program to institutions of higher education and not-for-profit research institutions, including not-for-profit industry associations whose mission is to support textile research and innovation. Gives preference in the award of such grants to collaborative research organizations that emphasize peer-reviewed research by leading academic and industry experts. Requires grant funds to be used for research and development activities that achieve at least one of the goals described in this Act, including to: (1) build and sustain innovation and competitiveness in the U.S. textile industry; (2) contribute to transforming the U.S. textile and apparel industry into a highly flexible supply chain; and (3) facilitate the creation of domestic jobs in the textile industry."
