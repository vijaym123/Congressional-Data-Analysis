Allows those services to include job training, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and other services identified by the Secretary. Defines \"covered veteran\" as a veteran who is at risk of becoming homeless and who: (1) is in imminent danger of eviction or foreclosure; and (2) demonstrates a compromised ability to make rental or mortgage payments based on income."
