  <summary>6/26/2009--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, subject to appropriations, to carry out a program of grants to public entities and private nonprofit organizations to: (1) make payments for up to three months to a covered veteran's landlord, mortgage company, or utility company for amounts of rent or mortgage that are in arrears, security deposits for rental properties, or utility bills or arrears; and (2) ensure that, when the payments begin, the veteran is in receipt of supportive services to further prevent homelessness. Allows those services to include job training, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and other services identified by the Secretary. Defines "covered veteran" as a veteran who is at risk of becoming homeless and who: (1) is in imminent danger of eviction or foreclosure; and (2) demonstrates a compromised ability to make rental or mortgage payments based on income.</summary>
