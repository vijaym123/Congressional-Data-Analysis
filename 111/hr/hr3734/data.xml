  <summary>10/6/2009--Introduced.
Urban Revitalization and Livable Communities Act - Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish an urban revitalization and livable communities program to provide federal grants to eligible general purpose local governments for various park and recreation purposes, including grants for rehabilitation and construction, innovation, at-risk youth recreation, and recovery action programs. Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register a list of such governments meeting specified criteria. Authorizes the Secretary to authorize other eligible governments in standard metropolitan statistical areas, but not on the list, to receive up to a specified portion of such grants. Authorizes the Secretary, upon approval of an application by the chief executive of an eligible applicant, to provide 70% matching rehabilitation and construction, innovation, and at-risk youth recreation grants directly to such applicant. Allows an applicant, at its discretion, to transfer a grant in whole or in part to special purpose local governments or private nonprofit agencies for recreational areas and facilities they own or operate which offer recreational opportunities to the general population Requires an applicant, as a requirement for project approval, to submit to the Secretary evidence of its commitment to ongoing planning, rehabilitation, service, operation, and maintenance programs for its park and recreation systems, expressed in a five-year local park and recreation recovery action program. Requires an eligible applicant for an at-risk youth recreation grant to include in its five-year program the goal of, and implementation strategies for, reducing crime and juvenile delinquency. Authorizes the Secretary to increase all grants to a state under this Act by up to 15% (but not more than 85% in total). Prohibits the conversion of any property improved or developed with assistance under this Act, without HUD approval, for uses other than for public recreation. Prohibits the use of funds under this Act for acquisition of land or interests in land.</summary>
