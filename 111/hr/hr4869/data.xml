  <summary>3/17/2010--Introduced.
Restroom Gender Parity in Federal Buildings Act - Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation to be revised to: (1) direct federal procurement executives involved in the acquisition, construction, or major renovation of any facility to increase infrastructure gender parity by constructing buildings in such a way that the number of toilets in women's restrooms will equal or exceed the number of toilets (including urinals) in men's restrooms or, if such a number is unachievable or not feasible, to receive a statement by the Administrator of General Services (GSA) as to why such a number of toilets is not needed; and (2) direct federal procurement executives involved in leasing buildings to give preference to the leasing of facilities that meet or exceed the female toilet to male toilet ratio of one to one. Requires the Director of Federal Procurement Policy to issue guidance to all federal procurement executives providing direction and instructions to renegotiate the design of proposed facilities, renovations for existing facilities, and leased facilities to incorporate improvements that are consistent with this Act.</summary>
