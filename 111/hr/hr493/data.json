Prohibits persons from constructing or operating impoundments for the storage or disposal of covered wastes on any land in any state except as in accordance with such regulations. Provides for the monitoring and enforcement of such requirements and prohibitions. Requires the Secretary to complete an inventory of existing impoundments for the deposit and maintenance of covered wastes. Authorizes the Secretary to issue orders necessary to ensure that impoundments comply with requirements. Defines the term \"covered wastes\" to mean wastes in areas other than the mine working or excavations, including coal ash, slag, and flue gas desulfurization materials stored or disposed of in liquid, semi-liquid, or solid form."
