  <summary>4/29/2009--Introduced.
Family and Medical Leave Restoration Act - Requires the Secretary of Labor to revise regulations promulgated under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) governing coverage and employee leave entitlements. Repeals certain regulations promulgated on November 17, 2008, and restores those promulgated on January 6, 1996. Directs the Secretary to revise regulations regarding an employer's request for recertification of a medical condition whose minimum duration is more than 30 days for leave taken because of an employee's own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a family member. Requires the Secretary to permit an employer to require such a recertification no earlier than: (1) the expiration of the length of time indicated in the original certification; or (2) one year after obtaining the original certification, if the original certification indicated that the medical condition would last longer than one year. Directs the Secretary to revise the requirements for continuing treatment of a serious health condition to: (1) remove requirements for a specific number of periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider in order to qualify for leave; and (2) require only the treatment that the health care provider determines proper. Requires the Secretary to revise any medical certification form templates to conform with this Act.</summary>
