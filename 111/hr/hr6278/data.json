States that title in the Islands and the related easements shall revert back to the United States 60 days after the Secretary of Interior notifies the District in writing that the District is not using any part of the conveyed property for recreational, environmental, or educational purposes in accordance with the National Children's Island, the Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan, or the Comprehensive Plan."
