  <summary>12/22/2010--Public Law.
Kingman and Heritage Islands Act of 2010 - Amends the National Children's Island Act of 1995 to allow the District of Columbia to use the lands conveyed (Kingman and Heritage Islands) and the related easements granted under such Act for recreational, environmental, or educational purposes in accordance with a specified Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan and a Comprehensive Plan. (Thus expands allowable uses for them by the District.) Revises the terms of the reversionary interest of the United States in such properties and easements. Repeals the conditions for reversion with respect to: (1) failure to commence improvements in or operation of the recreational park; or (2) abandonment or nonuse of the park after completion of construction and commencement of operation. States that title in the Islands and the related easements shall revert back to the United States 60 days after the Secretary of Interior notifies the District in writing that the District is not using any part of the conveyed property for recreational, environmental, or educational purposes in accordance with the National Children's Island, the Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan, or the Comprehensive Plan.</summary>
