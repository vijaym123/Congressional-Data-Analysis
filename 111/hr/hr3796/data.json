Directs the Secretary to ensure that 25% of the funds available for such payments are made available to organizations that: (1) meet each, some, or at least one of the transitional and supportive services criteria prescribed by the Secretary; and (2) furnish services to homeless individuals, of which less than 75% are veterans. Provides a higher priority in the making of such per diem payments for organizations that meet all or most of the transitional and supportive services criteria."
