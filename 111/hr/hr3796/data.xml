  <summary>10/13/2009--Introduced.
Makes the rate of per diem payments provided by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to organizations assisting homeless veterans the greater of: (1) the daily cost of care, as adjusted by other sources of income received by the organization; or (2) $60 per bed provided by the organization. Directs the Secretary to ensure that 25% of the funds available for such payments are made available to organizations that: (1) meet each, some, or at least one of the transitional and supportive services criteria prescribed by the Secretary; and (2) furnish services to homeless individuals, of which less than 75% are veterans. Provides a higher priority in the making of such per diem payments for organizations that meet all or most of the transitional and supportive services criteria.</summary>
