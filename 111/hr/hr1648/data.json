Requires a super majority vote in either chamber to waive or suspend such prohibition. Requires federal departments and agencies to report annually to the Comptroller General, and federal intelligence departments and agencies and their intelligence-related divisions to report annually to the House Select Committee on Intelligence, on total department or agency operating costs for the year, with a separate statement detailing waste, fraud, and abuse during such year. Requires each federal department or agency to design and implement a plan to reduce its operational costs from $.36 to $.15 of every $1.00 appropriated to it (or reduce such costs by 41.67%) through the use of new technologies and standard management practices. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to include, on each federal tax return, a statement of the aggregate dollar amount of waste, fraud, and abuse by all federal departments and agencies for the most recent year accounted for."
