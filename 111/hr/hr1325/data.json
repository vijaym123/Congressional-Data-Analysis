Requires such counseling to include information on: (1) banking; (2) budgeting; (3) credit cards and ratings; (4) loans, grants, education tax credits, and scholarships; (5) renting and housing; and (6) investing. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to encourage IHEs to perform these duties using interactive programs that test each borrower's understanding of the financial literacy information they receive."
