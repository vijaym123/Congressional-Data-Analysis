Limits the duration of such tax benefits to the lesser of 15 years or the number of years such an individual was incarcerated. Defines \"wrongfully incarcerated individual\" as an individual who was convicted of a criminal offense and was then pardoned or found not guilty of such offense because of innocence after serving all or a portion of a prison term. Disqualifies individuals with prior convictions punishable by more than one year of imprisonment."
