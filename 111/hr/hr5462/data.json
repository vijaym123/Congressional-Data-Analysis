Directs the Secretary to give preference in awarding grants, in the case of states or or organizations that are otherwise equally qualified, to: (1) states that made pregnancy and breastfeeding information services available on January 1, 2006; and (2) organizations that will provide pregnancy and breastfeeding information services in such states. Directs the Secretary to ensure that activities carried out using a grant under this Act are coordinated with other federal birth defects prevention and environmental health activities, including activities carried out by the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with respect to pediatric environmental health specialty units and children's environmental health centers. Directs the Secretary to evaluate pregnancy and breastfeeding information services to identify efficient and effective models of: (1) providing information; (2) raising awareness and increasing knowledge about birth defects prevention measures; (3) modifying risk behaviors; or (4) other outcome measures as determined appropriate by the Secretary. Defines the term \"pregnancy and breastfeeding information services\" to include only: (1) information services to provide accurate, evidence-based, clinical information regarding maternal exposures during pregnancy or breastfeeding that may be associated with birth defects or other health risks to an infant that is breastfed, such as exposures to medications, chemicals, infections, foodborne pathogens, illnesses, nutrition, or lifestyle factors; (2) the provision of accurate, evidence-based information weighing the risks of exposures during breastfeeding against the benefits of breastfeeding; and (3) the provision of such information through counselors, websites, fact sheets, telephonic or electronic communication, community outreach efforts, or other appropriate means. Authorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2016."
