Requires CHIP to participate in the state income and eligibility verification system (SAVE program). Requires application under Medicaid and CHIP of the citizenship verification procedures that applied before enactment of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA). Rescinds unobligated amounts under CHIPRA for the alternative state process for verification of declaration of citizenship or nationality for purposes of eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP."
