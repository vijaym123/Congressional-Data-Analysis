    "text": "Healthy Communities through Helping to Offer Incentives and Choices to Everyone in Society Act of 2010 - Revises federal health law to address obesity, including through: (1) routine collection of data needed to calculate body mass index (BMI); (2) expansion of coverage for obesity under Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP, formerly known as SCHIP); (3) programs to promote healthy eating behaviors and physical activity; and (4) training of health care professionals on how to treat and prevent obesity and aid individuals who are obese or overweight. Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to expand the nutritional requirements of food offered through child and adult food programs. Includes a physical activity component for children's food programs. Sets forth provisions to expand physical activity through: (1) programs to connect children and families with the outdoors; (2) guidelines for physical education in elementary and secondary schools; (3) inclusion of physical education as a core academic subject in schools; (4) tax incentives for employer provided membership to athletic or fitness facilities; and (5) enrichment programs, such as summer camps, for children on Indian reservations and tribal lands. Sets forth provisions to improve knowledge of and access to healthy foods through: (1) educating consumers about physical activity and lifestyles; (2) infrastructure improvements to food programs; (3) expansion of retail food stores offering affordable, nutritious foods in underserved communities; and (4) expansion of urban community gardens. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to make grants to assist local planning decisions and policies that increase the access of individuals to physical activity. Expands the program to provide safe routes to schools to include high school students. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the National Center for Health Statistics, to provide for the: (1) collection of data for determining the fitness levels and energy expenditures of children and youth; and (2) analysis of data collected as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and other data sources."
