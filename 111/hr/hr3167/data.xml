  <summary>7/10/2009--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Commerce, with the agreement of the Postmaster General, to utilize the services of mail carriers to serve as temporary enumerators in the 2010 decennial census before resorting to nonfederal personnel. Provides that a carrier selected to serve as an enumerator shall not be required to: (1) perform any postal duties on a day on which that carrier is serving as an enumerator; and (2) serve as an enumerator more than one day a week or after the services of letter carriers as enumerators are no longer required.</summary>
