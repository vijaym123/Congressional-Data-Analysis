  <summary>6/29/2010--Introduced.
Gulf Coast Conservation Corps Act of 2010 - Establishes the Gulf Coast Conservation Corps. Requires the President, through the Corps, to hire individuals who meet certain requirements (unemployed, U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, physically capable of performing work, and not enrolled as a full-time student) to carry out rehabilitation and enhancement projects involving the construction, maintenance, cleaning, and restoration in any area of the Gulf of Mexico affected by the oil discharged as a result of the Deepwater Horizon incident. Prohibits Corps participants whose positions are funded under this Act from displacing other employees whose positions are not funded under this Act. Allows Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund amounts to be used for the costs of carrying out this Act.</summary>
