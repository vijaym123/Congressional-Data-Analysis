  <summary>2/4/2010--Introduced.
Prohibits funds from being made available to any specified U.S. agency, instrumentality, or representative for the transfer or release any individual currently detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to the custody of the individual's country of origin or a third country unless the President certifies to Congress that: (1) the government of the country controls all of its territory, does not allow its territory to be used as a safe haven by terrorists or insurgent groups, including Al Qaeda, and has effectively tracked the activities of all Guantanamo-detained individuals who are transferred into its custody; and (2) there is no confirmed case of any Guantanamo-detained individual who reengaged in any actual or planned act of terrorism against U.S. citizens or members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Prohibits, with a national security waiver, funds made available to the Department of State from being used for assistance to the government of a country to which an individual currently detained at Guantanamo is to be transferred or released for use by such country's security forces unless the President makes such certification.</summary>
