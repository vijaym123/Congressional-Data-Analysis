Requires the Assistant Secretary to issue a waiver to an individual: (1) who, based on certain criteria, does not pose a terrorism risk; and (2) without regard to whether that individual would otherwise be disqualified by reason of a felony conviction, if the employer establishes acceptable alternate security arrangements."
