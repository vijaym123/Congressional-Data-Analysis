Authorizes the board to undertake a review upon the request of the individual, their surviving spouse, next of kin, or legal representative, or a Member of Congress. Requires a review request to be made within 15 years of a discharge or dismissal. Authorizes the board, after a review, to change the discharge or dismissal of the individual to honorable. Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to correct the military records of the individual in accordance with such change. Requires, if an appropriate health care official determines in an examination that a member who was deployed in support of a contingency operation has (or may have) PTSD or a TBI, the Secretary concerned to: (1) refer the member for an evaluation by a physical evaluation board; and (2) not separate the member until after considering the results of the evaluation."
