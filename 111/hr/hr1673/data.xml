  <summary>3/23/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) to repeal the statement that the prohibition against bonus, retention award, or incentive compensation to recipients under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) shall not be construed to prohibit any bonus payment required to be paid pursuant to a written employment contract executed on or before February 11, 2009, as such valid employment contracts are determined by the Secretary of the Treasury (or designee). (Thus makes no exceptions to the prohibition.)</summary>
