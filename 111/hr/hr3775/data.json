Requires such regulations to exempt a non-accelerated filer of a required annual report from the requirement that each registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues the audit report for a securities issuer attest to, and report on, the assessment by the issuer's management of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting (thereby extending the current moratorium on such requirement for small businesses)."
