  <summary>7/27/2010--Introduced.
Safe Drill Act of 2010 - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to precondition a new oil or gas lease upon the lessee's certification that the lessee will: (1) use the best available technology for all operations under the lease, including acoustic sensors; and (2) adopt and implement a comprehensive plan to respond to and clean up any discharge of oil occurring in lease operations. Directs the Secretary to require each person holding an existing oil or gas lease to make such a certification within six months after enactment of this Act. Empowers the Secretary to order suspension of operations and cancel the lease if such a certification is not forthcoming within the deadline. Requires the Secretary to: (1) review blowout preventers, emergency shutoff systems, and other oil discharge prevention technology (including emerging technology) used for oil and gas drilling operations; and (2) revise as necessary regulations governing the use of such technology based upon such review.</summary>
