Directs the Attorney General, in evaluating the effect on U.S. law enforcement and security interests for purposes of a country's eligibility for visa waiver program designation, to consider the extent to which such country is: (1) cooperating in extraditing or prosecuting Nazi war criminals; and (2) admitting into its territory aliens ordered removed from the United States because of participation in Nazi persecution, genocide, torture, or extrajudicial killing. Authorizes the President, after congressional notification, to not terminate a country's designation based upon such evaluation if in the national interest."
