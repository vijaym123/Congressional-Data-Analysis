Makes such restrictions inapplicable: (1) to positions within a small government agency (i.e., an agency that employs an average of not more than 500 employees) or the Departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), or Veterans Affairs (VA); or (2) during a period of national emergency declared by the President."
