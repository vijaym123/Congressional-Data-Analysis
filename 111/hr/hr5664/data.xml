  <summary>7/1/2010--Introduced.
High-Risk Pool Fairness Act - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to allow otherwise qualified individuals to enroll in a state's high risk health insurance pool if such an individual's maximum length of COBRA coverage (health insurance continuation benefits) has expired in the six months before applying for coverage in such pool or will expire within 30 days of applying for coverage in such pool. (Currently, only individuals without creditable coverage for six months are eligible for such pools.)</summary>
