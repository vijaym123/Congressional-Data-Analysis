  <summary>6/18/2009--Introduced.
Women's Obstetrician and Gynecologist Medical Access Now Act of 2009 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code to require a group health plan to allow a participant or beneficiary the option to seek obstetrical and gynecological physician services directly from a participating provider without a referral. States that this Act does not prevent a plan or issuer from establishing: (1) reasonable requirements for a participating provider to communicate with the participant's or beneficiary's primary care physician and surgeon regarding the participant's or beneficiary's condition and treatment; or (2) reasonable provisions governing utilization protocols and the use of obstetricians and gynecologists, or family practice physicians and surgeons, participating in the plan or issuer network. Applies such requirements to coverage offered in the individual market.</summary>
