    "text": "Bent's Old Fort Museum Collections Facility Act of 2010 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Koshare Indian Museum (Museum) on the Otero Junior College campus in La Junta, Colorado, to: (1) assist in the construction and furnishing of an addition to the Museum for use as a curatorial center to house the Museum's collections from Bent's Old Fort, Sand Creek Massacre, and other units of the National Park System; (2) provide no more than a specified amount for the construction and furnishing of the addition; and (3) house those portions of the collections of Bent's Old Fort, Sand Creek Massacre, and Washita Battlefield National Historic Sites, and possibly collections from other System units, that the Director of the National Park Service (NPS) determines appropriate for the facility. Requires federal funding provided for the construction and furnishing of such addition to be matched by non-federal contributions on a 1:1 basis. Requires the curatorial addition authorized by this Act to remain part of the Museum. Makes the Museum responsible for the maintenance and operational costs associated with the Museum, including the curatorial addition. Authorizes the assignment of NPS staff to provide curatorial services for the NPS museum objects housed at the Museum and to assist with the curation of other objects housed there."
