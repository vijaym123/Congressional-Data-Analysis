Requires the total service of an employee who retires eligible for an annuity under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) or who dies leaving a survivor entitled to benefits, to include the employee's days of unused sick leave for annuity computation purposes. Exempts a federal employee's part-time service performed before April 7, 1986, from proration requirements for purposes of annuity computation under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). District of Columbia Court, Offender Supervision, Parole, and Public Defender Employees Equity Act of 2009 - Entitles any individual who is treated as a federal employee under CSRS or FERS to have certain qualifying District of Columbia service included in calculating that individual's creditable federal service for specified purposes, including annuity eligibility. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow federal annuitants and members of the Armed Forces to elect to exclude retirement plan distributions for health insurance and long-term care premiums from gross income."
