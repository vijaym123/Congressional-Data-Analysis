  <summary>4/29/2009--Introduced.
Bulk Power System Protection Act of 2009 - Amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish measures to protect the bulk power system against cybersecurity threats resulting from: (1) vulnerabilities identified in the June 2007 communication to certain "Electricity Sector Owners and Operators" from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation; and (2) related remote access issues. Authorizes FERC to issue orders for emergency protective measures if the President provides FERC with a determination that an imminent cybersecurity threat to the system exists. Directs FERC to promulgate rules and procedures to prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of certain unclassified sensitive cybersecurity information. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to develop expertise and identify technical and electronic resources helpful to cybersecurity protection of the electric grid and all electric systems, including distribution-level electric systems. Requires Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam to prepare a comprehensive plan identifying emergency measures to be taken to protect the electric power supply of the national defense facilities located in such jurisdictions in the event of an imminent cybersecurity threat.</summary>
