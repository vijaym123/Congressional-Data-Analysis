  <summary>5/18/2010--Introduced.
Animal Torture Prevention Act of 2010 - Amends the federal criminal code to impose a fine and/or prison term of up to five years for creating, selling, distributing, or offering to sell or distribute a depiction of extreme animal cruelty. Defines "depiction of extreme animal cruelty" as any visual depiction of actual conduct in which one or more animals is tortured, maimed, mutilated, or subjected to other acts of extreme animal cruelty, that appeals to the prurient interest, and that, taken as a whole, does not have more than de minimis religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.</summary>
