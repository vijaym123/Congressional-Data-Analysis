  <summary>1/6/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act, in the case of an alien subject to removal, deportation, or exclusion who is the parent of a U.S. citizen child, to authorize an immigration judge to decline to order such removal if the judge determines that such action is against the child's best interests. States that such discretion shall not apply with respect to an alien whom the judge determines: (1) is excludable or deportable on security grounds; or (2) has engaged in sex trafficking or severe forms of trafficking in persons.</summary>
