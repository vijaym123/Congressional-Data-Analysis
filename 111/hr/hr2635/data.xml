Gender Equity in Health Premiums Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit a group health plan from requiring any individual to pay a premium or contribution which is greater than that for a similarly situated individual enrolled in the plan on the basis of the gender of such individual or such individual's dependent. Applies such prohibition to individual health insurance coverage. Directs the Comptroller General to evaluate enforcement of group and individual health insurance market rules.</summary>
