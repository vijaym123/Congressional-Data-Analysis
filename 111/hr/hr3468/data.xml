  <summary>7/31/2009--Introduced.
Promoting Health and Preventing Chronic Disease through Prevention and Wellness Programs for Employees, Communities, and Individuals Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a 50% tax credit for the costs of providing employees with a qualified prevention and wellness program. Defines "qualified prevention and wellness program" as a program that is certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and that includes three of the following components: a health awareness component, an employee engagement component, a behavioral change component, or a supportive environment component. Terminates such credit after 2017. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to institute an outreach program to inform businesses about the availability of the prevention and wellness program tax credit. Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to require the HHS Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to award grants to plan and implement prevention and wellness programs that promote health and wellness and prevent chronic diseases. Requires the HHS Secretary to encourage states to work with insurance companies on ways to promote and incentivize the participation of individuals and families in prevention and wellness programs. Amends PHSA and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to set forth conditions under which group health plans may establish premium discounts or rebates for modifying copayments or deductibles for participation in a wellness program.</summary>
