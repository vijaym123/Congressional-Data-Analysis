    "text": "International Travelers Bill of Rights Act of 2009 - Defines \"site operator\" as an individual or entity that operates a website providing access to international travel services, including an overseas vacation destination or a third party that operates a website offering international travel services. Requires a site operator to provide information in a clear and conspicuous way on its website regarding the health and safety risks of overseas vacation destinations marketed on the site, including the onsite health and safety services available and, if those services are not available 24 hours a day, the hours the services are available, if known. Requires a site operator to: (1) establish a process under which an overseas vacation destination will be suspended from its website as a result of consumer complaints regarding poor medical care, unsafe or unsanitary facilities, or other health-related issues; and (2) make all such complaints publicly available on its website. Allows an operator to modify complaints at the request of the complainant and to remove offensive language and personal identification. Treats a violation as an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under the Federal Trade Commission Act."
