Requires the Inspector General of each federal agency that employs an individual with original or derivative classification authority to randomly audit classified information from each agency component with employees that have classification authority. Directs the Archivist: (1) to require, at the time of classification of information, personal identifiers or unique agency identifiers of the individual applying classification markings, including the individual's agency, office, and position, to appear on the information; (2) when implementing the security education and training program pursuant to specified executive orders, to integrate training about the prevention of over-classification of information, the proper use of classification markings, the consequences of over-classification, and the lessons learned from implementation of the regulations; and (3) to implement a detailee program to detail federal agency personnel, on a nonreimbursable basis, to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) for training."
