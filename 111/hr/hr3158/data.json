    "text": "Place Based Health Care Act of 2009 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to Eligible Community Integrated Health Centers, which are organizations: (1) seeking to fully integrate their health care services into the community by locating in or near settings that serve particular target populations, such as schools, workplaces, or senior service facilities; and (2) organized for the purpose of providing health care, improving the quality of health care, and reducing the costs associated with the provision of health care provided to Center patients. Requires states to implement procedures to pay for primary health services furnished in a school-based health clinic under Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP, formerly known as SCHIP). Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business credit for employer-provided health and wellness benefits. Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to require the Assistant Secretary for Aging to establish an evidence-based disease prevention and health promotion program. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to authorize a Medicare Advantage organization to offer a Medicare Advantage plan exclusively within a geographic area that is limited to a senior housing facility if certain requirements are met. Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary to award grants for the planning and delivery of services to a special medically underserved population comprised of: (1) school-aged children in a school-based health center; or (2) residents of Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities, patrons of multipurpose senior centers, and individuals living in areas and facilities immediately accessible to such Communities and centers."
