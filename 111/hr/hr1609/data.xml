  <summary>3/19/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to deny certain agricultural commodity payments for not less than five years, or permanently, to a person or legal entity that has knowingly engaged in, or aided in the creation of a fraudulent document, or failed to disclose material information relevant to the administration of such benefits. (Current law authorizes payment denial for up to five crop years.) Requires that a person or legal entity that received benefits while ineligible due to excess income repay such amounts fully. Directs the Secretary to request the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to verify the income-related eligibility of a benefit applicant, and deny benefits to a person or entity determined to be ineligible. Authorizes Farm Service Agency reconsideration of a denial.</summary>
