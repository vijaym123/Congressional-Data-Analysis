  <summary>4/29/2009--Introduced.
Transparency and Accountability in Security Contracting Act of 2009 - Requires each contract, subcontract, or task order awarded or issued by a federal agency that includes private security functions (covered contract) to require the contractor to provide to the agency contracting officer specified information, including the number of persons to perform the security functions and the hiring and training process for such persons. Requires agency oversight in the performance of the covered contract. Requires the Secretary of Defense to establish and maintain a comprehensive security contracting database. Prohibits any agency from awarding a covered contract for performance of activities that require or involve: (1) direct participation by contractor personnel in hostilities with an enemy combatant or force; or (2) interrogation by contractor personnel of an individual who is a detainee or prisoner in the custody or under the effective control of the U.S. government. Directs the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to issue rules regarding the circumstances under which force may be used by contractor personnel performing private security functions within the area covered by a contingency operation and the types of force authorized. Requires each agency awarding a covered contract: (1) for a contingency operation, to prescribe minimum standards for contract personnel, including hiring, training, and equipment standards; and (2) to issue guidance on equipment used for private security functions. Requires the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to designate a Theater Security Contract Coordinating Officer for each contingency operation with respect to which covered contracts are awarded. Requires the Secretary of State to work through appropriate existing or new international fora to achieve agreement on an international framework regulating the use of private contractors for security functions and facilitating cooperation on measures to ensure the transparency and legal accountability of security contractors.</summary>
