  <summary>1/4/2011--Public Law.
National Wildlife Refuge Volunteer Improvement Act of 2010 - Amends the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (the Act) to authorize appropriations for FY2011-FY2014 to the Secretary of the Interior to carry out certain activities and services related to fish and wildlife, including for expenses related to gift acceptance, volunteer services, community partnership projects and programs, and refuge education programs. Amends the National Wildlife Refuge Volunteer and Community Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998 to direct the Secretary, through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, to carry out a National Volunteer Coordination Program within the National Wildlife Refuge System. Requires the Director to: (1) publish a national strategy for the coordination and utilization of volunteers within the System; and (2) provide at least one regional volunteer coordinator for each Service region to implement such strategy. Makes such coordinators responsible for assisting partner organizations in implementing volunteer projects and activities under cooperative agreements the Secretary may enter into pursuant to the Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the National Volunteer Coordination Program through FY2014. Requires the Secretary to submit a report to Congress that: (1) evaluates the accomplishments of the volunteer program, the community partnerships program, and the refuge education programs authorized under the Act, and of the National Volunteer Coordination Program and the national strategy; and (2) makes recommendations for improving the effectiveness of such programs.</summary>
