Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to establish a measurement standard for antimony, barium, cadmium, or chromium that is comparable to the measurement standard currently used. Sets forth: (1) factors to determine whether a product is designed or intended for wear or use by such children; and (2) penalties for violations of such prohibition."
