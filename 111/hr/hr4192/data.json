    "text": "Stornetta Outstanding Natural Area Act of 2010 - Establishes the Stornetta Public Lands Outstanding Natural Area in Mendocino County, California, for the protection, conservation, and enhancement of the unique and nationally important historical, natural, cultural, scientific, educational, scenic, and recreational values of certain lands in and around the Stornetta Public Lands, while allowing certain recreational and research activities to continue. Requires management of the Outstanding Natural Area as part of the National Landscape Conservation System for the protection of the resources of the Area. Allows only those uses that further the purposes for the establishment of the Outstanding Natural Area, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and other applicable laws. Withdraws federal lands and interests included within the Outstanding Natural Area from: (1) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the public land mining laws; and (3) operation of the mineral leasing and geothermal leasing laws and the mineral materials laws. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to complete a comprehensive management plan to provide long-term management guidance for public lands within the Outstanding Natural Area and to fulfill the purposes for which it is established. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with federal, state, and local agencies under the Federal Land Management Policy and Management Act involving the management, protection, development, and sale of public lands to better implement the management plan and to continue partnerships with local communities and the California Coastal National Monument and Manchester State Park. Allows the Secretary to authorize research activities within the Outstanding Natural Area for the purposes identified in this Act and pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act to conduct investigations, studies, and experiments on the Scretary's own initiative or, in cooperation with others, involving the management, protection, development, acquisition, and conveying of public lands. Permits the acquisition of adjacent state and privately held lands or interests and identified as appropriate for acquisition in the management plan only by donation, exchange with a willing party, or purchase from a willing seller. Specifies this Act's effect respecting: (1) military, commercial, and general aviation overflights; (2) law enforcement activities by the Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security (HHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies; and (3) protective perimeters and buffer zones. Ensures reasonable access to the Outstanding Natural Area by Indians and Indian tribes for traditional cultural and religious purposes. Permits temporary closures of one or more specific parts of the Outstanding Natural Area to the public to protect the privacy of traditional cultural and religious activities in those areas by a federally recognized Indian tribe or Indian religious community."
