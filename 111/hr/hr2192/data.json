    "text": "Climate Change Safeguards for Natural Resources Conservation Act - Requires the President to establish: (1) a national Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy to protect, restore, and conserve natural resources to enable them to become more resilient, adapt to, and withstand the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification and to identity opportunities to mitigate those impacts; and (2) a Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Panel to serve as a forum for interagency consultation on and the coordination of the development and implementation of such Strategy. Requires each agency represented on the Panel to complete and revise every five years an adaptation plan implementing such Strategy. Directs the Chair of the Council of Environmental Quality to: (1) chair the Panel; (2) advise the President on the Strategy and agency adaptation plans; and (3) coordinate agency natural resources actions in response to climate change and ocean acidification. Requires the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to: (1) establish a coordinated process for developing and providing science and information needed to assess and address the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on natural resources; (2) undertake a climate change and ocean acidification impact survey; and (3) establish a Science Advisory Board to advise the Secretaries on state-of-the-art science regarding the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on natural resources and on scientific strategies and mechanisms for protecting, restoring, and conserving natural resources. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) establish the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center within the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); (2) establish a National Fish and Wildlife Habitat and Corridors Information Program; and (3) develop a Habitat and Corridors Information System. Establishes in the Treasury the Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Account. Requires each state, to be eligible for funding from such Account, to prepare and update every five years a natural resources adaptation plan to address the potential impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on its natural resources and coastal areas. Provides for the allocation of such Account funds for specified state and federal natural resources adaptation activities."
