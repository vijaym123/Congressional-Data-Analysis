  <summary>2/26/2010--Introduced.
Farm to School Improvements Act of 2010 - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to provide competitive matching grants to schools, nonprofit organizations, and other able entities for farm to school programs that improve the access of school lunch and breakfast program participants to local foods. Provides that each grant may include an implementation grant, training and technical assistance grant, and planning grant. Requires farm to school programs to be designed to: (1) improve the nutritional health and well being of children; (2) procure healthy local foods from small and medium-sized farms; (3) support experiential nutrition education by involving school children in farm and garden-based agricultural education activities; (4) commit public and private community stakeholders to the sustained success of such programs; and (5) increase farmers' income by facilitating their access to institutional markets. Directs the Secretary to provide grant recipients with technical assistance that includes sharing information, best practices, research, and data on existing farm to school programs.</summary>
