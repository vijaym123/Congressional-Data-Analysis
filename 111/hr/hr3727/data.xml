Drinking Water Adaptation, Technology, Education, and Research (WATER) Act - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish and provide funding for a program of directed and applied research, to be conducted through a nonprofit water research foundation and sponsored by drinking water utilities, to assist the utilities in adapting to the effects of climate change. Requires research areas to include: (1) water quality impacts and solutions; (2) impacts on groundwater supplies from carbon sequestration; (3) water quantity impacts and solutions; (4) infrastructure impacts and solutions for water treatment and wastewater treatment facilities and underground pipelines; (5) desalination, water reuse, and alternative supply technologies; (6) energy efficiency and greenhouse gas minimization; (7) regional and hydrological basin cooperative water management solutions; (8) utility management, decision support systems, and water management models; (9) greenhouse gas emissions reduction and improvement of energy demand management; (10) water conservation and demand management; and (11) communications, education, and public acceptance.</summary>
