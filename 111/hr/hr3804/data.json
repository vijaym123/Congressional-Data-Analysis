Instructs the Secretary, with respect to any such agreement, to: (1) require the organization administering or managing a Pearl Harbor historic site to pay to the Secretary a fee to recover administrative costs associated with the use of the visitor center within the Pearl Harbor Naval Complex within the Monument for public access and ticket sales, the proceeds of which shall remain available for use by the NPS at the Monument; and (2) ensure the limited liability of the United States arising from the admission of the public through the visitor center to such a site and the sale or issuance of any tickets to such site. Prohibits the Secretary, under this title, from: (1) regulating or approving rates for admission to an attraction within a Pearl Harbor historic site; (2) regulating or managing visitor services of such historic sites within the Complex, other than at those sites managed by the NPS as part of the Monument; or (3) charging an entrance fee for admission to the Monument.
