Requires each covered entity and service provider to ensure information security, integrity, and confidentiality. Exempts a covered entity that participates in one or more FTC-approved self-regulatory programs (Choice Program) from: (1) the requirements for express affirmative consent required for information use pursuant to a Choice Program; (2) the requirement of access to information; and (3) private right of action liability.
