Exempts from such prohibitions authorized activities of a U.S. law enforcement or intelligence agency. Provides for criminal forfeiture of any gains from violations of this Act and of any equipment, software, or other technology used to commit such violations. Expands the definition of \"telephone call,\" for purposes of this Act, to mean a call made or received using any real time voice communications service, regardless of the technology or network used. Establishes fraud crimes related to electronic mail and caller ID spoofing as predicates for money laundering prosecutions."
