    "text": "Protection Against Wrongful Voter Purges Act - Amends the National Voter Registration Act to establish notice and review requirements for removal of individuals from a list of eligible voters by reason other than death or a change of residence, including removal by reason of mental incapacity. Requires the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to adopt voluntary guidance with respect to audits of the statewide computerized voter registration list so that each state will be able to ensure that the list: (1) reflects an accurate and complete count of all individuals validly registered to vote in federal elections; and (2) is secure against unauthorized uses. Revises requirements for removal of individuals from the official list of eligible voters by reason of change of residence. Permits removal upon state verification that the registrant has registered in a new jurisdiction. Specifies requirements for verification procedures. Declares that, if any registrant who is subject to removal from the official list of eligible voters requests that the appropriate election official review the removal, the removal shall not take effect unless the official demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the registrant was properly removed. Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prohibit a state from refusing to register any applicant who has completed the national voter registration application form. Prohibits delay or denial of registration on grounds of failure to match the applicant's driver's license or Social Security information with related information in the databases of state or federal governmental entities."
