    "text": "Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require as a condition of each license issued for a commercial or industrial nuclear production or utilization facility that in the case of an unplanned release described in this Act, the licensee notify, not later than 24 hours after such release, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the governments of the state and county in which the facility is located of the release. Describes such incidents as unplanned releases of quantities of radionuclides that are: (1) in excess of allowable limits for normal operation established by the NRC or other applicable federal laws or standards; and (2) within allowable limits for normal operation established by the NRC and other applicable federal laws or standards, but occur more than twice within a two-year period originating from the same source, process, or equipment at the facility. Requires the NRC to establish and maintain on its website a database of all notifications received by it of such unplanned releases and allow the public to search the database for such notifications by licensee."
