Requires an employer to provide paid sick leave to an employee for each workday, or portion of workday, that the employer directs the employee to leave work, or not come in to work, because the employee has symptoms of a contagious illness, or has been in close contact with an individual who has such symptoms. Limits paid sick leave up to a maximum of 5 days per 12-month period. Makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge, discipline, or otherwise discriminate against an employee who: (1) complies with this Act; or (2) has filed a complaint or instituted a proceeding under this Act, or has testified or is about to testify in such a proceeding. Subjects an employer to certain penalties for unpaid sick leave to, or unlawful termination of, an employee."
