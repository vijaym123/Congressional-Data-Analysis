  <summary>7/22/2010--Passed House amended.
Child Protection Improvements Act of 2010 - Amends the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to direct the Attorney General to: (1) establish policies and procedures for streamlining the process of obtaining nationwide criminal history background checks and for facilitating widespread access to such background checks by public or private child-serving organizations; (2) establish a criminal history review program to provide reliable and accurate information on the criminal history of an individual who has or seeks to have unsupervised access to a child and who is employed by, volunteers with, or seeks to be employed by or volunteer with, a child-serving organization or who owns or operates, or seeks to own or operate, a child-serving organization (covered individual); (3) conduct an annual assessment of state agencies to determine whether such agencies operate programs to ensure that a wide range of child-serving organizations have affordable and timely access to nationwide criminal history background checks; (4) compile demographic and other data on the implementation of this Act; and (5) submit reports to Congress on the programs and procedures established under this Act and on the data compiled under this Act. Requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to: (1) conduct, upon the request of the Attorney General or a background check designee, a nationwide criminal history background check; (2) provide criminal history records; and (3) investigate and resolve challenges to the accuracy and completeness of criminal history records. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2014. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that fees collected by the Attorney General or the background check designee should be sufficient to carry out their duties under this Act and to help support the criminal history review program. Limits the liability of entities participating in the background check system established by this Act resulting from a failure to conduct criminal background checks or to take adverse action against a covered individual after receiving a criminal history report. Imposes restrictions on the disclosure of fingerprints, criminal history records, or information in such records. Requires the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to enforce such disclosure restrictions and to destroy fingerprints and criminal history records after any transaction based upon such fingerprints or records is completed. Amends the PROTECT Act to provide for an extension of the Child Safety Pilot Program.</summary>
