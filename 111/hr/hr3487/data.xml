  <summary>7/31/2009--Introduced.
Amends federal criminal law, pending the disposition of a case in which a foreign national removes from or retains outside of the United States a child who is a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident with the intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of parental rights, to direct: (1) a court to freeze such national's U.S. financial assets (including property); and (2) the Secretary of State to identify such national's foreign-held assets and request that the appropriate countries freeze such assets. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend visa ineligibility for aliens involved in U.S. child abductions to situations in which the child is located in a foreign state that is a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.</summary>
