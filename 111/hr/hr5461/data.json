Directs the Comptroller General to study, by CRC screening procedure type, and report to Congress on: (1) the effect of the addition of the screening CTC benefit under this Act; (2) the effect of the addition of such benefit as part of an overall set of CRC screening made available to relevant Medicare population, including individuals over age 50 and over age 75; and (3) any other relevant questions involving access to, beneficiary preference of, and value of, screening CTC for Medicare beneficiaries."
