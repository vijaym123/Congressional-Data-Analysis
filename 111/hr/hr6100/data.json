Requires the Commission to: (1) maintain an information website beginning on the date of its first meeting; (2) hold at least three hearings; (3) develop a proposal that comprehensively resolves the Program's impacts on, and provides for full and final compensation to, the affected Indian tribes; and (4) issue a report."
