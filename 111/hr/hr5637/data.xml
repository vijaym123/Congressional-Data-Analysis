  <summary>6/29/2010--Introduced.
American Jobs Matter Act of 2010 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require an executive agency to state in a solicitation for competitive proposals that an offeror may submit information on the effects awarding the contract to the offeror would have on employment within the United States (jobs impact statement). Allows such statement to include a guarantee that jobs created or retained in the United States will not be moved outside the United States after award of the contract. Authorizes the contracting officer to consider such statement in evaluating the offer and to request further information to verify its accuracy. Requires the head of each agency to submit to Congress an annual report on the frequency of use within the agency of such statements in evaluating competitive proposals. Sets forth analogous provisions for defense contracts.</summary>
