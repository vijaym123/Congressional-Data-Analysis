Directs the Secretary to award a contract or grant to an entity to: (1) analyze and prepare the data collected under this Act for distribution; and (2) submit the data, analysis, and any corresponding documents to the National Center for Health Statistics for internal review. Requires the Secretary to make such information public.</summary>
