Requires such data collection efforts to be targeted to areas with the highest concentrations of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders based on the 2010 decennial census. Directs the Secretary to award a contract or grant to an entity to: (1) analyze and prepare the data collected under this Act for distribution; and (2) submit the data, analysis, and any corresponding documents to the National Center for Health Statistics for internal review.
