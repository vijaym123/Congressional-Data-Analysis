  <summary>7/26/2010--Introduced.
Union Member Protection Act - Amends the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (Landrum-Griffin Act) to require a labor organization's mandatory report to the Secretary of Labor on its constitution, officers, and basic organization to include, in a clear and simple format, both: (1) a description of the specific nature and total amount of political expenditures the labor organization proposes to make for the upcoming fiscal year; and (2) a disclosure of how each labor organization officer voted on each political expenditure made by the organization during the preceding fiscal year. Prohibits a labor organization from making political expenditures unless: (1) they are of the nature of those proposed in such report; and (2) they have received a full, free, and written authorization by secret ballot by a majority of the labor organization members. Makes officers jointly and severally liable for authorizing a political expenditure without first obtaining the authorization of labor organization members. Requires labor organization bylaws to provide expressly for a vote of the organization's principal officers on individual political expenditures in excess of $50,000. Requires a labor organization to make public the individual votes of such officers within 48 hours, including in a clear and conspicuous location on its website.</summary>
