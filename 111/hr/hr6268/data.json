Makes eligible for such grants such partners as: (1) not-for-profit community organizations dedicated to combating poverty and preventing abuse of wage and hour laws; (2) labor organizations; and (3) Joint Labor Management Cooperative Committees established under the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947. Directs the Secretary to establish a Wage Theft Prevention Fund to fund such grants. Prohibits the award of such a grant to: (1) any entity that infringes upon the organizational and collective bargaining rights guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act; or (2) the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) or any of its subsidiaries."
