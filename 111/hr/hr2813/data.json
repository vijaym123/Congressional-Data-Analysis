Directs: (1) the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in coordination with the Director of AHRQ, to develop policies and procedures for the development and maintenance of the registry; (2) the AHRQ and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use data in the registry and any analysis conducted to monitor and evaluate the safety of knee and hip replacement procedures and devices; and (3) the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the registry's progress. Requires the head of the registry to: (1) collect and store relevant data; (2) provide data to health care providers to allow them to evaluate their performance relative to their peers; (3) provide data to manufacturers of knee and hip replacement prostheses and related products to allow them to evaluate the safety and performance of their products relative to similar products; (4) develop a process to allow outside researchers to apply to use individually identifiable data contained in the registry to conduct longitudinal studies; (5) seek feedback from orthopedic practitioners and providers, product manufacturers, patient and consumer groups, and public health experts and epidemiologists; and (6) publish an annual report. Authorizes: (1) the head of the registry to request data from federal agencies; and (2) the Secretary to modify the information required to be reported under administrative data sets under Medicare to the extent it would result in the reporting of useful information."
