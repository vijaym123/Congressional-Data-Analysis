Miami Dade College Land Conveyance Act - Directs the Attorney General to convey a parcel of land held by the Bureau of Prisons to Miami Dade College in Miami-Dade County, Florida, so that the college can use the site for a new educational building that includes a parking area with designated parking spaces for the Bureau of Prisons. Permits the Attorney General to revert the land to the United States if it is not being used in accordance with the purpose specified above. Requires any determination of the Attorney General concerning such a reversion to be made on the record after an opportunity for a hearing. Allows the Attorney General to have the exact size and legal description of the land to be conveyed determined by a survey and requires the College to bear the cost of the survey.
