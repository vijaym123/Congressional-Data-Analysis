Permits the Attorney General to revert the land to the United States if it is not being used in accordance with the purpose specified above. Requires any determination of the Attorney General concerning such a reversion to be made on the record after an opportunity for a hearing. Allows the Attorney General to have the exact size and legal description of the land to be conveyed determined by a survey and requires the College to bear the cost of the survey. Makes inapplicable to such land conveyance requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for an environmental impact statement."
