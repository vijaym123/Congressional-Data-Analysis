Requires an independent appraisal of the market value of the real property, to be paid for by the Military Museum. Requires the conveyance to include improvements, structures, and fixtures located on the conveyed real property and related personal property. Directs the Military Museum to use and maintain the conveyed property, for a minimum period of 30 years, in a manner consistent with the use of it at the time it is conveyed. Reverts, at the option of the Administrator, all or any portion of the conveyed property in its then existing condition to the United States if it ceases to be used or maintained as described above. Permits the Military Museum to seek abrogation of such use restriction by obtaining advance written consent of the Administrator and by payment of the fair market value of the property to be released. Requires the Military Museum to submit annual reports, for a period of 30 years, on the Military Museum's use and maintenance of the conveyed property and any other reports required by the Administrator to evidence the Museum's continuous use of such property. Requires the Administrator to conduct inspections on the conveyed property to confirm the information provided in such reports every 5 years for a period of 30 years. Makes the Military Museum responsible for all reasonable and necessary costs associated with the conveyance, including real estate transaction and environmental documentation costs. Bars anything in this Act being construed to affect or limit the application of or obligation to comply with any environmental law, including requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) with regard to the sale or other transfer of U.S. owned real property on which any hazardous substance was stored for one year or more, known to have been released, or disposed of."
