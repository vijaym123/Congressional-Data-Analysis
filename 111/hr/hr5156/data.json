Defines \"clean energy technology\" to mean a technology related to the production, use, transmission, storage, control, or conservation of energy that will contribute to a stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations through reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of energy-related emissions and: (1) reduce the need for additional energy supplies by using existing supplies with greater efficiency or by transmitting, distributing, or transporting energy with greater effectiveness through U.S. infrastructure; or (2) diversify the sources of the energy supply to strengthen energy security and to increase supplies with a favorable balance of environmental effects if the entire technology system is considered. Directs the Secretary, consistent with the National Export Initiative, to provide information, tools, and other assistance to U.S. businesses to promote clean energy technology manufacturing and facilitate the export of clean energy technology products and services. Requires such assistance to include: (1) developing critical analysis of policies to reduce production costs and promote innovation, investment, and productivity in the clean energy technology sector; (2) helping educate companies about how to tailor their activities to specific markets with respect to their product slate, financing, marketing, assembly, and logistics; and (3) helping U.S. companies learn about the export process and export opportunities in foreign markets, navigate foreign markets, and provide input regarding clean energy technology manufacturing and trade policy developments and trade promotion. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on how funds will be used to: (1) focus on small and medium-sized U.S. businesses; (2) encourage the creation and maintenance of the greatest number of clean energy technology jobs in the United States; and (3) encourage the domestic production of clean energy technology products and services. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress by January 1, 2015, on whether the assistance program should be continued and an assessment of the extent to which it has been successful in: (1) developing critical analysis of policies to reduce production costs and promote innovation, investment, and productivity in the clean energy technology sector; (2) assisting U.S. businesses with exporting clean energy technology products and services; (3) creating jobs directly related to the clean energy technology sector in the United States; and (4) helping U.S. companies provide input regarding clean energy technology manufacturing and trade policy developments and trade promotion. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015. Prohibits funding appropriated pursuant to this Act from being provided in the form of a monetary grant."
