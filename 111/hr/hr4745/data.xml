  <summary>3/3/2010--Introduced.
Achievements of the GI Bill Gold Medal Act - Directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate to arrange for the presentation of a single gold medal in honor of the recipients of assistance under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (commonly known as the GI Bill of Rights), in recognition of their great contributions in both their military and civilian life, and the contributions of Harry W. Colmery in initiating actions which led to the enactment of that Act. Requires the medal, following its award, to be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display. Expresses the sense of Congress that the medal should be made available for display elsewhere, particularly at appropriate locations selected by the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs (VA), Defense (DOD), or Education.</summary>
