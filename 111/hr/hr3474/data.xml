  <summary>7/31/2009--Introduced.
Safe Babies Act of 2009 - Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to authorize the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to create, and provide technical assistance to, local court teams to promote the well-being of maltreated infants and toddlers and their families, prevent the recurrence of child abuse and neglect, and promote timely reunification of families. Defines "maltreated infant or toddler" as any child three years of age or younger who is the victim of a substantiated case of physical abuse, neglect, medical neglect, sexual abuse, or emotional abuse. Directs the Administrator to award a grant to establish a National Court Teams for Maltreated Infants and Toddlers Resource Center to provide information, training, and other assistance to local court teams and to establish a uniform data collection system related to the operation and outcomes of projects initiated by such teams. Sets forth required activities for local court teams, including: (1) conducting monthly reviews of cases handled by such teams; (2) incorporating child-focused services into case plans for maltreated infants and toddlers; (3) organizing training of community members working with court teams; (4) identifying areas for improvement in providing mental health and substance abuse treatment for families; and (5) prioritizing after-care services for families.</summary>
