  <summary>7/16/2009--Introduced.
Durban Taxpayer Refund Act of 2009 - Finds that the goals of the 2001 United Nations World Conference Against Racism held in Durban, South Africa, and commonly referred to as the Durban Conference, were undermined by hateful, anti-Jewish rhetoric and anti-Israel political agendas, prompting both Israel and the United States to withdraw their delegations from the Conference. States that it shall be U.S. policy to lead a diplomatic effort to: (1) encourage other countries to not fund any portion of the Durban Review Conference; and (2) explore alternative forums for combating racism and related intolerance. Directs the Secretary of State to withhold from the U.S. contribution to the regularly assessed biennial budget of the United Nations an amount equal to the percentage of such contribution that the Secretary determines would be or has been allocated by the United Nations for the Durban Review Conference or its preparatory or follow-on activities. Provides that: (1) until the Secretary makes a specified certification to the appropriate congressional committees the United States shall withhold from its contribution to such budget an amount equal to the percentage of such contribution that the Secretary determines has been allocated by the United Nations for any conference, other multilateral forum, or related preparatory or follow-on activity of any conference or other multilateral forum under U.N. aegis; and (2) withheld appropriations shall revert to the Treasury if no such certification is made within one year after the appropriation.</summary>
