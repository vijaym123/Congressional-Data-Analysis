    "text": "Stop Iran's Nuclear Weapons Program Act of 2010 - Subjects a parent entity, with specified exceptions, to penalties for violations of certain sanctions regarding Iran committed by a subsidiary outside of the United States that would be subject to prohibitions if committed inside the United States or by a U.S. person. Prohibits with respect to Iran: (1) issuance of specified licenses to export or reexport civil aviation goods, services, or technology; and (2) such goods, services, or technology from being exported or reexported. Increases temporarily consular service fees for processing machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combined border crossing identification cards and nonimmigrant visas. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate amortization of geological and geophysical expenditure tax incentives if certain sanctions regarding the development of Iranian petroleum resources are imposed on any member of an expanded affiliated group whose common parent is a foreign corporation. Amends the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 to impose sanctions on a person that knowingly: (1) enters into an agreement with Iran to purchase or provide payment for future delivery of Iranian petroleum resources; or (2) purchases, subscribes to, or facilitates the issuance of Iranian sovereign debt. Directs the President to: (1) publish in the Federal Register the name of each foreign person or foreign entity for which there is credible information indicating that the person or entity is an agent, front, instrumentality, official, or affiliate of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC); and (2) apply specified property sanctions to such person or entity. Directs the President to: (1) publish in the Federal Register the name of each foreign person or foreign entity for which there is credible information indicating that the person or entity is as an agent, front, instrumentality, official, or affiliate of the IRGC and has committed or assisted, or poses a significant risk of committing, acts of violence threatening the peace or stability of Iraq or the government of Iraq; and (2) apply specified property sanctions to such person or entity. Excludes an alien so identified from U.S. entry. Sets forth mandatory and discretionary measures to be taken against a foreign person or entity that provides material support to the IRGC. Requires additional measures (including foreign assistance, arms, import, and export restrictions) to be taken against a foreign government so identified. Amends the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act to include in the President's proliferation report to Congress identification of every foreign person who, on or after January 1, 2009, transferred to Iran, Syria, or North Korea goods, services, or technology that could assist efforts to extract or mill uranium ore within the territory or control of Iran, North Korea, or Syria. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to promote the divestment of investments in Iran or the Sudan by permitting the deferral of tax on gain from the sale of securities in any business that is engaged in certain discouraged activities in Iran or the Sudan if the holder of such securities purchases replacement securities from a business not engaged in such discouraged activities. Includes as discouraged activities in Iran: (1) investment of $20 million or more in Iran's energy sector or in a person who provides Iran with oil or liquefied natural gas tankers or pipelines; (2) an extension of credit of $20 million or more to a person who invests in Iran's energy sector; (3) investment that enhances Iran's ability to develop petroleum resources; (4) the sale of goods, services, technology, information, or support to Iran that allows it to maintain or expand its petroleum industry; or (5) providing Iran with refined petroleum resources. Includes as an Iran or Sudan discouraged activity business transactions with or charitable donations to any Iranian or Sudanese person designated as a terrorist or to any foreign terrorist organization. Directs the head of an executive agency to ensure that each contract with a company for the procurement of goods or services, agreement for the use of federal funds, or the provision of technical assistance requires the company to certify that it does not conduct specified business operations in Iran. Authorizes contract termination and federal contract suspension or debarment for submission of a false certification. Authorizes a state or local government to adopt and enforce measures to prohibit the state or local government from entering into or renewing a procurement contract with persons that conduct specified business operations in Iran. Directs the President to seek to terminate International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) loan disbursements to Iran. Directs the President, if the Bank approves a Country Assistance Strategy for Iran or approves a loan to Iran, to: (1) terminate any U.S. contribution to the Bank, the International Finance Corporation, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Corporation for the fiscal year in which the Country Assistance Strategy or loan is approved, or if loan disbursements have been made, for the following fiscal year; (2) prohibit the sale of Bank debt instruments in the United States; and (3) prohibit the purchase of any such debt instrument by a U.S. person or state or municipal governmental entity. Terminates such Bank-related restrictions 30 days after the date on which the President certifies to Congress that: (1) the government of Iran has ceased providing support for acts of international terrorism and no longer satisfies the requirements for designation as a state-sponsor of terrorism; and (2) Iran has ceased the pursuit, acquisition, and development of ballistic missiles and nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons."
