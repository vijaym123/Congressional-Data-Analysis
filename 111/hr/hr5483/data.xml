  <summary>6/8/2010--Introduced.
Directs the President ProTempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to arrange for the award of a congressional gold medal in honor of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps, collectively, in recognition of their patriotism and civic activism in a time of emergency during World War II which saved civilian hospital nursing services and provided 80% of the nursing staff for civilian hospitals during World War II. Directs that such medal be given to the Smithsonian Institution to be displayed as appropriate and made available for research. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Smithsonian Institution shall make the gold medal received under this Act available for display elsewhere, particularly at other locations associated with the Corps.</summary>
