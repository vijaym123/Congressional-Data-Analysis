Requires the Secretary to assess the extent to which school food authorities pay such indirect and direct costs, and then issue additional guidance relating to the types of costs that are reasonable and necessary. Authorizes the Secretary, after the completion of such assessment, to promulgate regulations addressing: (1) any identified deficiencies in the allocation of such indirect and direct costs to school food authorities; and (2) the authority of school food authorities to reimburse only those costs identified by the Secretary as reasonable and necessary."
