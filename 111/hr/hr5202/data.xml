National School Lunch Protection Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue guidance to school food authorities participating in the school lunch and breakfast programs covering program rules pertaining to the costs that may be charged to the nonprofit school food service accounts of such authorities, including indirect and direct costs. Requires the Secretary to assess the extent to which school food authorities pay such indirect and direct costs, and then issue additional guidance relating to the types of costs that are reasonable and necessary. Authorizes the Secretary, after the completion of such assessment, to promulgate regulations addressing: (1) any identified deficiencies in the allocation of such indirect and direct costs to school food authorities; and (2) the authority of school food authorities to reimburse only those costs identified by the Secretary as reasonable and necessary.</summary>
