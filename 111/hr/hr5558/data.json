Defines \"qualified older worker\" as an individual who is age 55 or older and whose income, excluding unemployment compensation and certain veterans and social security payments, is not more than 400% of the federal poverty line. Directs the Secretary of Labor to award a grant to establish and operate a National Resource Center on Aging and the Workforce to address issues on age and the workforce and to collect, organize, and disseminate information on older workers."
