  <summary>6/17/2010--Introduced.
Older Americans' Job Opportunities Blueprint Act of 2010 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) include as a member of a targeted group, for purposes of the work opportunity tax credit, a qualified older worker; and (2) extend such credit through 2012. Defines "qualified older worker" as an individual who is age 55 or older and whose income, excluding unemployment compensation and certain veterans and social security payments, is not more than 400% of the federal poverty line. Directs the Secretary of Labor to award a grant to establish and operate a National Resource Center on Aging and the Workforce to address issues on age and the workforce and to collect, organize, and disseminate information on older workers.</summary>
