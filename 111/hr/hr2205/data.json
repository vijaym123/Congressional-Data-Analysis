Allots funds among state grantees on the basis of their share of children from birth through age five who are from impoverished families. Directs the Secretary to award competitive grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) and experienced public or private community-based entities to support and expand quality, local early childhood home visitation programs for families that have English language learners and are expecting a child or have pre-kindergarten children. Directs the Secretary of Defense to make competitive grants to LEAs, schools, and community-based organizations that serve military dependents to support and expand high quality early childhood home visitation programs for military families that are expecting a child or have pre-kindergarten children. Requires each grantee to provide: (1) voluntary early childhood home visitation at least once a month to as many eligible families as is practicable; (2) training and technical assistance to program staff; and (3) program participants with access to other early childhood and family services. Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a public information and educational campaign to inform the public and new parents about the importance of proper care for infants and children under five years of age."
