  <summary>11/17/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) reduce between 2010 and 2015 the excise tax rate on the net investment income of tax-exempt private foundations from 2 to 1.32%; and (2) suspend between 2010 and 2015 the 1% reduction in such tax rate for private foundations that meet certain distribution requirements. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct and submit to Congress by December 31, 2013, a study which examines the effect of the tax rate changes of this Act on the level of grantmaking by private foundations.</summary>
