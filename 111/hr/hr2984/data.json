Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue regulations establishing standards and circumstances under which an individual is authorized to use force (including lethal force) against an individual in the defense of a vessel against piracy. Limits the liability of the individuals, the federal government, and owners, operators, and masters of vessels in actions arising out of a use of force authorized under the regulations. Directs the Secretary to work through the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to establish agreements to promote coordinated action among flag and port states to deter, protect against, and rapidly respond to acts of piracy against the vessels of, and in the waters under the jurisdiction of, those nations, and to ensure limitations on liability similar to those under this Act."
