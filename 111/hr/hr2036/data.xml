  <summary>4/22/2009--Introduced.
Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Enhancement Act - Creates a part E (Gifted and Talented Students) under title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to, or contract with, states, local educational agencies (LEAs), institutions of higher education (IHEs), and other public or private agencies and organizations to assist them in meeting the educational needs of gifted and talented students, including by training school personnel in the identification and education of gifted and talented students. Requires the Secretary to establish a National Research Center for the Education of Gifted and Talented Children and Youth through grants to, or contracts with, one or more IHEs, states, or a combination or consortium of such entities and other public or private agencies and organizations. Directs the Secretary to make grants to states, based on each state's share of individuals aged 5-17, to fund competitive subgrants to LEAs for the development or expansion of gifted and talented education programs. Gives highest part E funding priority to programs and projects designed to develop new information that: (1) improves the capability of schools to identify and serve gifted and talented students; and (2) assists schools in identifying and providing services to gifted and talented students who may not be identified and served through traditional assessment methods.</summary>
