(Under current law the Attorney General provides such notice to the Secretary of State.) Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, upon a determination that a foreign government denies or unreasonably delays accepting an alien who is a citizen, subject, national, or resident of that country after the alien has been ordered removed, to deny admission to any citizen, subject, national, or resident of such country who is seeking or has received a diplomatic nonimmigrant visa."
