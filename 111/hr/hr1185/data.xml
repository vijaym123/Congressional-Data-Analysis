Primary Care Volunteer Incentive Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a loan repayment program to repay up to $5,000 each year of an individual's graduate educational loans in exchange for such individual serving without pay as a primary care physician for at least four hours per week for five consecutive years at a community health center with a shortage of primary care physicians. Directs the Secretary to give priority to individuals who agree to serve in community health centers in designated health professional shortage areas. Sets forth factors for the Secretary to consider in determining the amount to pay for each year of service. Directs the Secretary to provide additional reimbursements for the individual's tax liability resulting from such payments.</summary>
