Blue Ridge Parkway and Town of Blowing Rock Land Exchange Act of 2009 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to exchange approximately 20 acres of land within the boundary of the Blue Ridge Parkway, identified as Blowing Rock Reservoir, for approximately 192 acres of land owned by the town of Blowing Rock in North Carolina. Permits the equalization of the values of the lands proposed for exchange to be achieved by an adjustment to their acreage if they are found to be not equal in value. Requires the lands acquired by the Secretary through the exchange to be administered as part of the Parkway. Grants the Secretary, if the town wants to dispose of the reservoir property, the right of first refusal to acquire that property for the Parkway.</summary>
