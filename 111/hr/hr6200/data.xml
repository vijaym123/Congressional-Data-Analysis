  <summary>10/13/2010--Public Law.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) WIPA and PABSS Extension Act of 2010 - Amends part A of title XI of the Social Security Act to extend through FY2011 the authorization of appropriations for the Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) program and the Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS) Program. Requires each entity awarded a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract under the WIPA Program to report annually to the Commissioner of Social Security on the benefits planning and assistance provided to individuals under such grant, agreement, or contract. Requires up to 10% of the total amount obligated through a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract awarded under the WIPA Program for a fiscal year to a state, private agency, or organization to remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year. Limits the extended availability of such amount, however, to benefits planning and assistance only for individuals who are within the grant, agreement, or contract recipient's caseload as of immediately before the beginning of such fiscal year.</summary>
