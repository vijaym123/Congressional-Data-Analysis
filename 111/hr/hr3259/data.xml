  <summary>7/20/2009--Introduced.
Establishing Grants for College Access and Completion Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive five-year grants to certain nonprofit organizations for the provision of mentoring, support, outreach, and other services that encourage disadvantaged students to attend institutions of higher education. Prohibits a grant from covering more than 85% of the cost of the services the grant supports. Requires nonprofit applicants to have met certain requirements, including that they have provided scholarship and support programs to students in more than one state, and have a business plan in place to expand into other states.</summary>
