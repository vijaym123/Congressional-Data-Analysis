Directs the Secretary of the Interior or of Commerce, as appropriate, acting through the Fish and Wildlife Service, any other federal land management agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, or a state conservation agency, to relocate from the flood control levee: (1) any threatened or endangered species of plant or animal that would be taken in the course of the agency action; and (2) any plant or other natural material that the Secretary considers to be suitable habitat, or a component of suitable habitat, for such species and that the Secretary determines would be damaged, destroyed, or removed in the course of the action. Bars the Secretary from requiring a non-federal person (other than a state conservation agency) to carry out any measures to minimize or mitigate impacts of agency flood control actions."
