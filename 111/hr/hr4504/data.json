    "text": "Standards for Internet Non-Censorship Act of 2010 or the SINC Act of 2010 - Declares it to be the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should establish interim minimum standards of non-censorship for Internet search providers and create programs to restrict access to domestic online information by providers determined to be censoring nonviolent political speech; (2) any long-term solution to the problem of the censorship of nonviolent political speech on the Internet must include minimum standards of non-censorship set by a coalition of free countries; and (3) the President should negotiate with free countries to adopt minimum standards for non-censorship of nonviolent political speech as a condition for access to the Internet. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to begin a proceeding to adopt regulations to restrict repressive Internet search providers from accessing domestic online information. Requires the FCC, if it adopts such regulations, to develop, operate, and maintain a public website that lists repressive providers and the reasons for finding that the providers were repressive. Authorizes the FCC to enforce the regulations using any existing enforcement authority to prevent collusion to evade the regulations. Directs the Secretary of State to seek to enter into agreements with free countries to adopt minimum standards. Authorizes the FCC to begin a proceeding to adopt regulations to restrict or prevent entities that operate outside of any such agreements from accessing domestic online information."
