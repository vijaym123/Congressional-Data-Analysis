  <summary>1/15/2009--Introduced.
Extends the authorized concurrent receipt of disability severance pay from the Department of Defense (DOD) and compensation for the same disability under any law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to include all veterans with a combat-related disability. (Under current law, such concurrent receipt is limited to those veterans who incur a disability in the line of duty in a combat zone or during the performance of duty in combat-related operations.) Makes such amendment effective as of January 28, 2008 (the date of enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008).</summary>
