Limits the use of such grants to eligible activities for residents of assisted housing whose family incomes do not exceed 80% of the area median income. Authorizes eligible activities that result in displacement of assisted residents only if accommodations provided for them during the period of displacement are similar to their existing assisted housing, located in a comparable community, and only a reasonable distance from it. Prescribes requirements for assistance to private owners of assisted housing."
