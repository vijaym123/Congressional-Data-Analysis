Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: (1) increase to $50 million the limit on coordinated spending by a national party and its presidential candidate; (2) prohibit political parties from spending unregulated funds (soft money) on their national conventions; (3) prohibit an authorized committee of a candidate from establishing a joint fundraising committee with a political committee other than the candidate's authorized committee; and (4) require presidential campaign committees to disclose information about bundled campaign contributions (i.e., a series of contributions exceeding specified threshold amounts)"
