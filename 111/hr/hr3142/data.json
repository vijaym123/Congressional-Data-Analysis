Prohibits an mortgagee from accelerating the maturity of or commencing any legal action regarding a mortgage (including foreclosure) or taking possession of any mortgagor security: (1) unless the mortgagee meets certain notice and other specified conditions; or (2) if the mortgagor has applied for or is receiving assistance under this Act. Requires mortgagor repayment of such assistance, plus interest."
