Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) include structures that have less than 10 feet of head or would result in less than 1 megawatt of capacity as part of a certain study and report required under the Energy Policy Act of 2005; (2) consult with nonfederal and noncontracting interests in implementing this requirement; and (3) implement this requirement on a nonreimbursable basis."
