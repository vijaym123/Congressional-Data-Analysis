Audit the BP Fund Act of 2010 - Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) conduct an ongoing independent investigation and audit of the fund and claims process created by BP to compensate persons affected by the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico beginning on April 20, 2010, to determine the effectiveness of fund operations, including the timeliness of claim payments and the accuracy of determining amounts of damages compensated; and (2) report to Congress on the effectiveness of the operations until they are completed. Authorizes the Comptroller General to use any investigative powers, including subpoena power, in conducting such investigation and audit. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) BP should fully cooperate with the Comptroller General to assure that the fund is accurately, expediently, and efficiently compensating victims for their losses; and (2) the costs incurred by the Comptroller General to carry out responsibilities under this Act should be reimbursed by BP.</summary>
