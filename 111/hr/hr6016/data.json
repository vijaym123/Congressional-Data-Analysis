Authorizes the Comptroller General to use any investigative powers, including subpoena power, in conducting such investigation and audit. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) BP should fully cooperate with the Comptroller General to assure that the fund is accurately, expediently, and efficiently compensating victims for their losses; and (2) the costs incurred by the Comptroller General to carry out responsibilities under this Act should be reimbursed by BP."
