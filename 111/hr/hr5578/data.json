Directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a tracking system to regulate the growing, handling, transportation, and disposal of all pharmaceutical and industrial crops and their byproducts to prevent contamination. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to assess civil penalties for violations of such provisions. Directs the National Academy of Sciences to report on alternative methods to produce pharmaceuticals or industrial chemicals that may be conducted in controlled production facilities without the risk of contamination. Genetically Engineered Food Safety Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to include genetically engineered food in the definition of \"food additive.\" Sets forth requirements governing petitions to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for a regulation prescribing the conditions of safe use of a genetically engineered food additive, including information to be included in the petition and factors to be considered by the Secretary in making a decision. Authorizes civil actions against: (1) a person alleged to have violated FFDCA provisions regulating genetic food additives; and (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services for failure to perform a mandatory act or duty related to genetic food additives. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to collect a filing fee for petitions to: (1) defray costs related to such petitions; and (2) provide for research on the safety of genetic food additives. Authorizes an officer or employee conducting an inspection to order the detention of food if such person has reason to believe that such food violates the FFDCA. Requires all food retailers to register with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expedite recalls, embargoes, and seizures."
