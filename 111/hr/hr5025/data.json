Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, to award grants to eligible entities to: (1) facilitate the purchase of health information technology; (2) enhance the use of such technology, including covering costs associated with upgrading such technology in order to meet the criteria required to become a certified electronic health record (EHR) technology; (3) train personnel in the use of such technology; (4) improve the secure electronic exchange of health information among behavioral and mental health professionals, substance abuse professionals, and other health care providers; (5) improve such technology for adaptation to community-based behavioral health settings; (6) assist with the implementation of telemedicine, including facilitation of distance clinical consultations in rural and underserved areas; and (7) collaborate and integrate with health information technology regional extension centers. Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to include qualified clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatric hospitals, mental health treatment facilities, and substance abuse treatment facilities within the health professionals, hospitals, and Medicaid providers eligible for incentive payments for the meaningful use of certified EHR technology."
