  <summary>3/26/2009--Introduced.
Black Carbon Emissions Reduction Act of 2009 - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to report to Congress on black carbon (light-absorbing component of carbonaceous aerosols) emissions, including : (1) a summary of current research identifying major sources, control technologies, quantifying metrics, and public health and environmental benefits associated with additional controls; and (2) recommendations regarding emissions monitoring techniques and capabilities, areas for additional study of technologies, operations, and strategies with the greatest potential to reduce emissions, and actions the government may take to encourage or require emission reductions. Requires the Administrator, within a year, to finalize regulations under the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions of black carbon or propose a finding that existing regulations promulgated pursuant to such Act adequately regulate them. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress on the amount, type, and direction of all present U.S. financial, technical, and related assistance to foreign countries to reduce, mitigate, and abate black carbon emissions.</summary>
