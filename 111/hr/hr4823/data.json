Bars the inclusion of any land located outside the boundaries of Coconino National Forest in the Scenic Area. Requires the Scenic Area to be administered in accordance with this Act, the land and resource management plan for the Coconino National Forest, and the laws and regulations applicable to the National Forest System. Permits land exchanges that dispose of System land included in the Scenic Area only if: (1) they result in the acquisition of land from a willing seller for inclusion in the Area; (2) there is no net loss of System land; and (3) an environmental analysis is completed before any land is exchanged. Requires the deposit of the proceeds received from sales or exchanges of land within the Coconino National Forest in a special fund in the Treasury to be used for the acquisition of land or interests within the National Forest System in Arizona. Prohibits the establishment of the Scenic Area from affecting: (1) the maintenance and use of public, private, or Forest Service roads; and (2) the legal status, maintenance and use rights-of-way and utility easements; (3) the management of state, municipal, or private land; (4) the management of National Forest System land that is not included in the Scenic Area; and (5) the construction or siting of transportation or water projects and associated facilities. Prohibits anything in this Act creating a private cause of action in any federal, state, or tribal courts."
