Requires the Board to establish criteria for determining project eligibility for financial assistance under this Act. Sets forth the duties of the Bank's executive committee and audit committee. Requires the Bank to establish a risk management committee, which shall: (1) create financial, credit, and operational risk management guidelines for the Bank; (2) set standards to ensure diversification of lending activities by both region and infrastructure project type; and (3) create conforming standards for infrastructure finance securities.
