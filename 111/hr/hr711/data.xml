  <summary>1/27/2009--Introduced.
Hedge Fund Adviser Registration Act of 2009 - Amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to repeal the exception to the registration requirement for any investment adviser who: (1) during the preceding twelve months has had fewer than 15 clients; and (2) neither holds himself or herself out generally to the public as an investment adviser, nor acts an an investment adviser to any registered investment company or any business development company. (Thus requires such private investment advisers to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC].)</summary>
