    "text": "Prohibits, subject to an existing provision, an alien who on May 8, 2008, was a resident of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) from being removed from the United States on the grounds of illegal presence in the CNMI prior to the date that is five years after the transition program effective date if such alien is lawfully present in the CNMI on such date and is: (1) a permanent resident of the CNMI; (2) an immediate relative of a citizen; or (3) the parent of a citizen who was under 21 years old. Makes such an alien parent eligible for a special nonimmigrant visa. Specifies conditions for such visa, including the requirement that the parent reside in the CNMI. Makes an alien who, as of May 8, 2008, was subject to CNMI immigration regulations eligible for a special nonimmigrant visa. Provides that such visa shall: (1) grant the alien all the privileges of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence except that the alien must reside in the CNMI; and (2) be valid until the earlier of the date on which the alien adjusts to permanent resident status or the date on which the alien ceases to reside in the CNMI. Makes an alien who, as of May 8, 2008, was subject to CNMI immigration regulations eligible for adjustment to permanent resident status if such alien applies for adjustment between January 1, 2014-November 28, 2014. Extends the effective date of the CNMI visitor entry program for 180 days. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to administer the program during such 180-day period consistent with CNMI provisions governing the program that were in effect prior to the commencement of such period. Amends the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 to: (1) direct the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of DHS to reduce the fees for family-based immigration benefit applications and petitions collected from CNMI residents who had immediate relative status pursuant to CNMI immigration laws as of May 8, 2008; and (2) waive related sponsor income requirements."
