    "text": "Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, upon the request of a public housing agency (PHA) which has a Moving to Work agreement (under the demonstration program authorized by the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996), to extend it for a 12-month period under such terms as are, or were, in effect upon the agreement's expiration. Requires, for a PHA that previously received an extension of its agreement and entered into a subsequent agreement after January 1, 2009, the Secretary to, upon the PHA's request, invalidate such subsequent agreement and extend any agreement in effect as of such date for a 12-month period under such terms as were in effect as of that date. Prohibits the Secretary from extending a Moving to Work agreement if a PHA is noncompliant with its agreement's terms. Expresses the sense of Congress that the maximum number of PHAs authorized to participate in the Moving to Work demonstration program should not be expanded until the demonstration program has been reformed and permanently authorized through enactment of a federal law."
