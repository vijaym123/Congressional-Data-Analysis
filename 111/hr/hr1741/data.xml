Witness Security and Protection Grant Program Act of 2010 - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) make competitive grants to state, tribal, and local governments to establish or maintain programs to protect or assist witnesses in court proceedings involving homicide, a serious felony or drug offense, or gangs or organized crime; (2) evaluate grant applicants based on specified criteria, including such government's level of witness intimidation and level of serious crimes; (3) provide technical assistance to grant applicants for establishing or maintaining a witness protection plan; and (4) develop and disseminate within one year after development best practice models to assist states and other relevant entities in addressing witness safety, short-term and permanent witness relocation, financial and housing assistance, and other necessary services. Expresses the sense of Congress that states and relevant entities should use the best practice models developed by the Attorney General to evaluate, improve, and develop witness protection or witness assistance programs. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) ensure that grants funds under this Act are equitably distributed throughout the United States and that due consideration is given to applicants of rural and urban communities; and (2) report to Congress not later than December 31, 2012, on the implementation of this Act and not later than December 31, 2015, on the programs funded by grants awarded by this Act.</summary>
