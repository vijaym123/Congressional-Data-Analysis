Expresses the sense of Congress that states and relevant entities should use the best practice models developed by the Attorney General to evaluate, improve, and develop witness protection or witness assistance programs. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) ensure that grants funds under this Act are equitably distributed throughout the United States and that due consideration is given to applicants of rural and urban communities; and (2) report to Congress not later than December 31, 2012, on the implementation of this Act and not later than December 31, 2015, on the programs funded by grants awarded by this Act."
