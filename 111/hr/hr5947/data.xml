  <summary>7/29/2010--Introduced.
Voluntary Incentive Auctions Act of 2010 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide that, if consistent with the public interest for a licensee to voluntarily relinquish some or all of its spectrum usage rights in order to permit the assignment of new initial licenses or the allocation of spectrum for unlicensed use, the proceeds from the use of a competitive bidding system may be shared with any licensee who agreed to voluntarily relinquish such usage rights. Prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from reclaiming frequencies of broadcast television licensees or any other licensees on an involuntary basis for certain licensing purposes.</summary>
