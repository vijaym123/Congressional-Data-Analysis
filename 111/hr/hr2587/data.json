Requires any revenue generated, during a specified two-year reinvestment period, from the sale, rental, redevelopment, rehabilitation, or any other eligible use in excess of the cost to acquire and redevelop or rehabilitate an abandoned or foreclosed home or residential property, to be provided to and used by the state or local government in accordance with, and in furtherance of, the intent and provisions of this Act. Requires transfer of the revenue so generated in excess of such cost to the special account established in the U.S. Treasury into which money received as gifts and proceeds from the sale or redemption of gifts shall be deposited. Requires such revenues to be used for public debt reduction only."
