States that cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules and other equines, and poultry presented for slaughter for human consumption, and the carcasses or parts of carcasses and the meat and food products of those animals, shipped in interstate commerce shall be identified in a manner that enables the Secretary to trace: (1) each animal to any location at which the animal was held at any time before slaughter; and (2) each carcass or part of a carcass and food product forward from slaughter through processing and distribution to the ultimate consumer. Directs the Secretary to establish a traceability system for all stages of production, processing, and distribution of meat and meat food products produced through the slaughter of such animals. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) prohibit or restrict entry to a slaughtering establishment of an animal not so identified; and (2) require a person or entity to maintain records. Amends the Poultry Products Inspection Act and the Egg Products Inspection Act to establish similar provisions for poultry and poultry products and for eggs and egg products."
