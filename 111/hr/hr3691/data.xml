  <summary>10/1/2009--Introduced.
Seniors and Veterans Economic Stimulus Act of 2009 - Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to extend through the first three months of 2010 the Secretary of the Treasury's authority to make a payment of $250 to each eligible individual age 18 or over who, during the three-month period immediately preceding enactment of such Act (for purposes of payments made for calendar year 2009), or the three-month period beginning with December 2009 (for purposes of payments made for calendar year 2010), was entitled to Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, railroad retirement benefits, or veterans disability compensation or pension benefits. Repeals the limitation to one payment only to an individual regardless of whether the individual is entitled to, or eligible for, more than one benefit or cash payment. Entitles such individual to a payment in each of calendar years 2009 and 2010. Rescinds from the unobligated balance of the discretionary appropriations made available by division A of such Act the amount determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to be required to offset the increase in spending resulting from this Act.</summary>
