Defines \"field EMS\" as emergency medical services provided to patients prior to or outside a medical facility or other clinical setting.\u00a0 Requires the Administrator of NHTSA to develop and implement a cohesive national strategy to strengthen the development of field EMS at the federal, state, and local levels. Directs the Administrator to establish: (1)\u00a0the EQUIP grant program to promote excellence, quality, universal access, innovation, and preparedness\u00a0in field EMS;\u00a0 (2)\u00a0the SPIA grant program to improve field EMS system performance, integration, and accountability; and (3) national guidelines for medical oversight of field EMS.\u00a0 Authorizes the Administrator to maintain, improve, and expand the National EMS Information System, including the National EMS Database, to insure that database information\u00a0is available to federal and state policymakers, EMS stakeholders, and researchers. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to make grants for the development, availability, and dissemination of field EMS education programs and courses for field EMS personnel.\u00a0Directs the Secretary to: (1) complete an evaluation of alternative delivery models for medical care through field EMS and the integration of field EMS patients with other medical providers and facilities; and (2)\u00a0conduct or support up to five demonstration projects to evaluate alternative dispositions of\u00a0field EMS patients (e.g., transporting such patients by ambulance\u00a0to alternative medical facilities). Amends title XI (General Provisions) of the Social Security Act to include field EMS as a model for testing by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require: (1)\u00a0 the Director of the Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\u00a0to establish a Field EMS Evidence-Based Practice Center to support research to promote the highest quality of emergency medical care in\u00a0field EMS and the most effective delivery system for such care; and (2) the HHS Secretary to establish an Emergency Care Coordination Center to promote and fund research, collaboration, and preparedness in emergency medicine and trauma health care. Requires the Administrator to establish and administer a National Emergency Medical Services Advisory Council to provide advice and recommendations to federal agencies and a national forum to\u00a0deliberate on field EMS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) establish the Emergency Medical Services Trust Fund; and (2) allow taxpayers to designate a portion of any income tax overpayment and make additional contributions to finance such Fund."
