  <summary>6/12/2009--Introduced.
American Energy Act - Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act of 2009 - Considers the Draft Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2010-2015 released by the Secretary of the Interior to have been approved as final under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and to be in full compliance with all requirements of applicable laws. Deems the Secretary to have issued a final environmental impact statement for the program under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a lease sale in each outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning area for which there is a commercial interest in purchasing federal oil and gas production leases; and (2) promulgate regulations that establish management of the surface occupancy of the portion of the OCS near the coastline. Amends the Submerged Lands Act to extend to 12 nautical miles a coastal state's allowable seaward boundary. Excepts from the operation of provisions concerning the rights of states all of the oil and gas mineral rights for lands beneath the navigable waters that are located within the expanded offshore seaward boundaries. Deems such rights to be federal property and part of the federal OCS for purposes of OCLA. Revises the procedure for determining each state's Adjacent Zone and each OCS Planning Area. Provides a means of voluntary relinquishment of any portion of a geologically prospective lease. Revises procedures for the granting of OCS leases concerning multiple leases for the same tract, payment of receipts, joint bidding restrictions in Alaska, price thresholds applicable to royalty suspension volumes, and a conservation of resources fee for nonproducing leases. Provides schedules for the sharing and allocation of OCS receipts. Prohibits leasing east of the military mission line (86 degrees, 41 minutes West Longitude, and extending south from the coast of Florida to the outer boundary of U.S. territorial waters in the Gulf of Mexico). Revises OCS leasing provisions concerning: (1) timing and location under each five-year program; (2) consideration of other laws affecting leasing; (3) suggestions from government entities and other persons; and (4) estimates of resources within a state's Adjacent Zone and projections of receipts expected to be shared with each Adjacent State and its political subdivisions. Provides rules for the approval by a federal agency or a state of a petroleum or natural gas pipeline, respectively. Provides guidelines for the preparation of environmental impact statements. Prohibits uses on the federal OCS or in state waters by federal agencies that are incompatible with oil and gas leasing and substantially full exploration and production of geologically prospective tracts. Authorizes the repurchase and cancellation of certain leases that were subject to litigation in the Court of Federal Claims. Allows environmental mitgation requirements associated with leasing activities to be satisfied at a site away from the area affected. Requires the Secretary to establish OCS regional headquarters. Allows a lessee of an existing oil and gas lease for an area located completely within 12 nautical miles of the coastline within the California or Florida Adjacent Zones the option of exchanging such lease for a new oil and gas lease having a primary term of 5 years. Repeals the program of coastal impact assistance to producing states and political subdivisions. Repeals the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act - Requires the Secretary to establish a competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in an environmentally sound program for the exploration, development, and production of Alaska's Coastal Plain's oil and gas resources. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to terminate the prohibition against leasing or other development leading to production of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Directs the Secretary to hold a lease sale offering an additional 10 parcels for lease for research, development, and demonstration of oil shale resources, under the terms offered in a specified solicitation of bids. Allows the temporary reduction of royalties, fees, rentals, bonus, or other payments for leases of federal lands for the development and production of such resources as necessary to incentivize and encourage their development. Refinery Permit Process Schedule Act - Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide financial assistance to states to hire personnel with expertise relevant to consideration of federal refinery authorizations. Requires a federal agency responsible for refinery authorization to provide nonfinancial assistance to facilitate state consideration of such authorizations. Directs the President to appoint a federal coordinator to facilitate such authorizations. Instructs the President to designate at least three closed military installations as potentially suitable for the construction of a refinery. Requires that at least one such site be designated as potentially suitable for construction of a refinery to produce biofuel. Requires the redevelopment authority for each such installation to consider the feasibility and practicability of siting a refinery on the installation. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal certain requirements regarding refinery revitalization. Amends the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the income tax credits for: (1) the purchase of a new qualified alternative fuel vehicle; (2) the cost of qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property; and (3) qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles placed in service. Directs the Secretary of Energy to carry out a program of awards to advance the development and application of innovative energy technologies and new energy sources, including for innovative gasoline-operated automobile and advanced battery manufacturing. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend various energy efficiency tax incentives. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to repeal the requirement that the associated lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of government-procured alternative or synthetic fuels not exceed those from equivalent fuel from conventional petroleum sources. Provides for the procurement of coal-to-liquid fuel and loans to facilities that produce such fuel. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend various renewable energy tax credits and to include in certain incentives advanced nuclear power and clean-coal equipment. Establishes in the Treasury the American Renewable and Alternative Energy Trust Fund. Requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to establish an expedited procedure for issuing combined construction and operating licenses for new reactors. Sets a goal of licensing 100 new reactors, or the megawatt equivalent, by 2030. Requires creation of a uranium supply-disruption mitigation reserve and the convening of a national summit on uranium resources. Establishes policies concerning the disposal of high-level nuclear waste. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a National Nuclear Energy Council to advise the Secretary and assist nuclear energy-related investors. Revises NEPA environmental assessment procedures with respect to the consideration of alternative locations or actions for renewable energy projects. Excludes greenhouse gases and climate change from regulation under the Clean Air Act. Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to prohibit the consideration of the impact of greenhouse gases upon species of fish, wildlife, or plants. Sets forth jurisdictional rules and procedures for claims that arise concerning any energy project under a federal lease.</summary>
