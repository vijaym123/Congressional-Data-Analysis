(Sec. 3) Increases the SBA disaster loan limit to $3 million. Prohibits the Administrator from requiring repayment on such loans until 12 months after final disbursement of the approved loan amount. (Sec. 5) Provides specific disbursement directions for each of the following categories of loans: (1) $150,000 or less; (2) more than $150,000 up to $500,000; and (3) more than $500,000. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the Administrator to make a disaster assistance grant of up to $100,000 to a small business that: (1) is located in an area affected by a major disaster; (2) certifies its intention to reestablish the business in the same county as originally located; (3) has applied and was rejected for a conventional disaster assistance loan; and (4) was in existence for at least two years before the disaster declaration. Provides a grant priority for small businesses determined to be economically viable but unable to meet short-term financial obligations. Authorizes grants of $100 million for each of FY2010-FY2011 and authorizes appropriations for such grants. (Sec. 7) Directs the Administrator to develop a disaster preparedness and response plan for each SBA region. Requires each plan to identify the three disasters, natural or manmade, most likely to occur in such region.

Authorizes grants for each of FY2010-FY2011. (Sec. 9) Authorizes the Administrator to make a loan to any homeowner whose primary residence has been adversely impacted by the installation of toxic drywall manufactured in China. Allows the loan to be used only for the repair or replacement of such drywall. (Sec. 10) Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2011 for administrative expenses and small business disaster assistance loans."
