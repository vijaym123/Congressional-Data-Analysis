Small Business Disaster Readiness and Reform Act of 2009 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Small Business Act to prohibit the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), in making a small business disaster loan of $250,000 or less, from requiring a borrower to use the borrower's home as collateral. (Sec. 3) Increases the SBA disaster loan limit to $3 million. Prohibits the Administrator from requiring repayment on such loans until 12 months after final disbursement of the approved loan amount.

(Sec. 6) Authorizes the Administrator to make a disaster assistance grant of up to $100,000 to a small business that: (1) is located in an area affected by a major disaster; (2) certifies its intention to reestablish the business in the same county as originally located; (3) has applied and was rejected for a conventional disaster assistance loan; and (4) was in existence for at least two years before the disaster declaration. Provides a grant priority for small businesses determined to be economically viable but unable to meet short-term financial obligations. Authorizes grants of $100 million for each of FY2010-FY2011 and authorizes appropriations for such grants.
