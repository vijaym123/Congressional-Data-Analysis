Requires each grantee to place its grant funds in a reserve account for use in facilitating one or more charter schools' access to private-sector capital. Conditions the grant on the grantee's using at least 50% of the grant to fund projects consistent with one of several green building certification programs that include: (1) the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System; (2) the Energy Star program; (3) the Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) green building rating program; (4) the Green Building Initiative environmental design and rating system (Green Globes); or (5) any other green building certification program adopted by the state or entity that has authority over the local educational agency. Allows the waiver of such condition in certain circumstances."
