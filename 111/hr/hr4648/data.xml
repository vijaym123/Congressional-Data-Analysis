  <summary>2/23/2010--Introduced.
Keep Terrorists at Bay Act of 2010 - Prohibits any court from ordering the release into the United States of an alien: (1) who is an unprivileged enemy belligerent (i.e., an alien who has engaged in or supported hostilities against the United States or was a part of Al Qaeda) or who has been determined by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal, at any time, to be an enemy combatant; and (2) who is or was in U.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Prohibits the Secretary of State from issuing a visa to any such alien or the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) from admitting into the United States, or granting any type of immigration status to, any such alien. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security from paroling (i.e., admitting for a temporary period) any such alien into the United States.</summary>
