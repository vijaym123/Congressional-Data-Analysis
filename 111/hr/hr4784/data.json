Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) denounce governments and private entities that restrict, censor, ban, and block access to information on the Internet; and (2) support the deployment, at the earliest practicable date, of technologies aimed at defeating state-directed and state-sponsored Internet suppression and the persecution by governments and private entities of individuals who use the Internet."
