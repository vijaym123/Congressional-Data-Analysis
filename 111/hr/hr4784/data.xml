Internet Freedom Act of 2010 - Directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish the Internet Freedom Foundation to: (1) award grants, agreements, or contracts to develop deployable technologies to defeat Internet suppression and censorship; and (2) award incentives to organizations that successfully develop such technologies. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) denounce governments and private entities that restrict, censor, ban, and block access to information on the Internet; and (2) support the deployment, at the earliest practicable date, of technologies aimed at defeating state-directed and state-sponsored Internet suppression and the persecution by governments and private entities of individuals who use the Internet.</summary>
