  <summary>7/31/2009--Introduced.
Disaster Recovery Improvement Act - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize the President to increase the maximum total contributions for a major disaster by 5% under such Act if, at the time of a declaration of a major disaster, the affected state has in effect and is actively enforcing an approved building code. Sets forth state building code submission and approval requirements, including use of the nationally recognized model building code as a minimum standard. Directs the President, in making a contribution to a state or local government or a person that owns a nonprofit facility for repair, restoration, and replacement of a damaged facility, to provide not less than 50% of the President's initial estimate of the federal share as an initial payment. Provides for expedited payments. Requires the federal share for debris removal to be increased by 5% for states and local governments that have: (1) a debris management plan approved by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); (2) prequalified two or more debris and wreckage removal contractors before the date of declaration of the major disaster; and (3) resubmitted such plan to the Administrator for approval every four years. Allows a recipient of a debris removal grant to: (1) use funds for the costs of recycling debris and wreckage resulting from a major disaster; and (2) retain any financial benefit received from the salvage. Increases the period for appeals of disaster assistance decisions. Directs the Administrator to review, update, and revise the factors considered to measure the severity, magnitude, and impact of a disaster. Authorizes the President to provide emergency assistance to pets and animals and their owners.</summary>
