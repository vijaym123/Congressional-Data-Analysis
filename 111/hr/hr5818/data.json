Applies such prohibition to any legislative provision increasing direct costs of a federal private sector mandate (currently, federal intergovernmental mandate only) in any legislation reported by a congressional appropriations committee. Amends Rule XVIII (The Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union) of the Rules of the House to state that the Committee of the Whole may be precluded from considering an amendment proposing only to strike an unfunded federal private sector mandate from the portion of the bill then open to amendment only by specific terms of a special order of the House. Amends the CBA to equalize the threshold between private sector and intergovernmental mandates."
