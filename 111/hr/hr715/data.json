Allows the Secretary of the Interior, with the consent of the State of Arizona, to acquire from the state land or interests in land within the boundary of the Park. Authorizes the Secretary, if unable to acquire such state land, to enter into an agreement that would allow the National Park Service (NPS) to manage state land within such boundary. Directs the Secretary to conduct and report on a study that identifies lands that would be a part of any future boundary adjustments for the Park and examines the natural, cultural, recreational, and scenic values and characters of the lands identified."
