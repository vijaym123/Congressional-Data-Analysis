Global Learning Early Education Challenge Fund Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to local educational agencies (LEAs), Head Start agencies, and preschools for planning or implementing Global Learning Early Education programs (preschool through grade eight dual-language, developmental bilingual, or second language immersion programs). Gives grant priority to LEAs, Head Start agencies, and preschools in which at least 40% of the students enrolled are limited English proficient. Requires each grantee to partner with one or more of the following entities: (1) a community-based organization; (2) an early childhood organization; (3) an elementary, secondary, or postsecondary school; or (4) an LEA. Requires implementation grant recipients to: (1) provide incentives for the recruitment and retention of bilingual and culturally and linguistically relevant staff for their Global Learning Early Education programs, including high-quality professional development; and (2) involve students' families in the programs. Directs the Secretary to establish a Research Council, composed of individuals with specified educational expertise, to guide research into Global Learning Early Education programs that identifies best practices and evaluates student progress.</summary>
