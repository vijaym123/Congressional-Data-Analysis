Gives priority to LEAs that partner or coordinate with local, regional, or national entities. Requires the use of grant funds to: (1) involve the parents of girls and underrepresented minorities in stoking their children's interest in STEM; (2) provide tutoring and mentoring programs in such fields; (3) enable such students and their teachers to attend STEM events outside the classroom; (4) provide after-school and summer programs for students in such fields; (5) purchase education materials or equipment to facilitate STEM instruction; (6) provide such students with academic advice and assistance in selecting high school courses; (7) pay up to 50% of the cost of a STEM internship for such students; and (8) train school personnel to facilitate students' progress in such fields."
