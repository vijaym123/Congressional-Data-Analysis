  <summary>1/8/2009--Introduced.
Metro Economies Green Act or MEGA - Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish a metro area green zone grant program to make grants to local government units to support and establish green job programs that: (1) target low-income, difficult-to-employ, and formerly incarcerated persons; and (2) involve local business, academia, trade associations, nonprofits, and other stakeholders in energy-efficient economic development and green job training and creation. Authorizes the Secretary also to establish competitive programs to make grants to local government units to support and establish: (1) a similar mini-metro green program that engages smaller communities in green economic and workforce development; and (2) an alternative green academies program that provides green job training, employment opportunities, and other life skills to high school dropouts, formerly incarcerated youth, and individuals unable to attend traditional institutions of higher education. Directs the Secretary to select one unit of general local government or nonprofit organization designated by such a unit to establish and operate a Metro Area Green Institute to serve as a national resource center to support municipally based, green economic and workforce development efforts.</summary>
