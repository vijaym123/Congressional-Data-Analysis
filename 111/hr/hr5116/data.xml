Sets forth requirements for the disposal of federal scientific collections, including procedures for the transfer of collections no longer needed to qualified researchers. Requires OSTP to develop a common set of methodologies to be used by federal agencies to project costs associated with the management and preservation of collections. (Sec. 105) Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to authorize federal agencies to award prizes competitively to stimulate innovation that has the potential to advance an agency's mission. Prohibits the government from gaining an interest in intellectual property developed by a participant in a competition without the written consent of the participant, but authorizes the government to negotiate a license for the use of intellectual property developed by a participant. Permits: (1) agreements with private, nonprofit entities to administer competitions; and (2) support for a competition to consist of federally appropriated funds and funds provided by the private sector for cash prizes. Title II: National Aeronautics and Space Administration - (Sec. 201) Expresses the sense of Congress that a renewed emphasis on technology development would enhance current mission capabilities of NASA and enable future missions, while encouraging NASA, private industry, and academia to spur innovation. States that NASA's Innovative Partnership Program is a valuable mechanism to accelerate technology maturation and encourages the transfer of technology into the private sector. (Sec. 202) Expresses the sense of Congress that NASA is uniquely positioned to interest students in STEM, not only by the example it sets, but through its education programs. Requires NASA to develop educational programs with specified goals. (Sec. 203) Directs the Administrator to arrange for an independent assessment of impediments to space science and engineering workforce development for minority and underrepresented groups at NASA. (Sec. 204) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the International Space Station (ISS) represents a valuable and unique national asset which can be utilized to increase educational opportunities and scientific and technological innovation; (2) if the period for active utilization of the ISS is extended to at least 2020, the potential for such opportunities and innovation would be increased; and (3) efforts should be made to fully realize such potential. Directs the Administrator to: (1) evaluate and expand efforts to maximize NASA's contribution to interagency efforts to enhance STEM education capabilities and U.S. technological excellence and global competitiveness; and (2) report on such evaluation. (Sec. 205) Directs the Administrator to study the potential impacts of a commercial orbital platform program on STEM education in the United States. Title III: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - (Sec. 301) Amends the America COMPETES Act to require NOAA to implement specified programs and activities with respect to the oceanic and atmospheric research and development program. Requires the Administrator to develop and report on NOAA's strategy for enhancing transformational research in its research and development portfolio to increase U.S. competitiveness in oceanic and atmospheric science and technology. (Sec. 302) Amends the America COMPETES Act to require the Administrator to build upon the educational programs and activities of NOAA, with consideration given to the goal of promoting the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM fields and in promoting the acquisition and retention of highly qualified and motivated young scientists. Sets forth educational program goals. (Sec. 303) Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with the Secretary of Education, to request the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to study and report on the oceanic and atmospheric research and development scientific workforce. Requires the Administrator to evaluate such study and develop a workforce program and plan to institutionalize NOAA's federal science career pathways and address aging workforce issues. Title IV: National Institute of Standards and Technology - National Institute of Standards and Technology Authorization Act of 2010 - (Sec. 402) Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2013 to the Secretary of Commerce for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for: (1) scientific and technical research and services laboratory activities; (2) facilities construction and maintenance; and (3) industrial technology services activities, including the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program (MEP) and the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award program. (Sec. 403) Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to establish in the Department of Commerce an Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology. Requires the Under Secretary to serve as the Director of NIST. (Sec. 404) Makes it an objective of the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Centers to enhance productivity and technological performance in U.S. manufacturing through providing community colleges with information about the job skills needed in small- and medium-sized manufacturing businesses in their regions. Requires the Director to establish, within the Hollings Manufacturing Partnership Program, an innovative services initiative to assist small- and medium-sized manufacturers in: (1) reducing energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental waste to improve profitability; (2) accelerating the domestic commercialization of new product technologies; and (3) identifying and diversifying new markets.
