Oncology Care Quality Improvement Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a pilot program of oncology care quality improvement (OCQI) under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to evaluate the impact of three provider-led approaches to improve the care quality and outcome for Medicare beneficiaries with cancer while addressing care cost drivers by creating greater efficiencies in the program. Specifies the three provider-led approaches as: (1) evidence-based guideline adherence; (2) patient education and care coordination services; and (3) end-of-life planning and counseling services. Directs the Secretary to appoint an advisory committee to collaborate with the Secretary on the creation and implementation of the OCQI program.</summary>
