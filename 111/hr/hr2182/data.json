Authorizes state and local governments receiving funds to set aside up to .5% of such funds, in addition to any funds already allocated to administrative expenditures, to conduct planning and oversight to prevent and detect waste, fraud, and abuse. Authorizes the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to provide for the use by state and local governments of GSA federal supply schedules for goods or services that are funded by such Act. Makes participation by a firm that sells to a state or local government through such schedule voluntary. Requires the OMB Director to issue guidance to ensure accurate and consistent reporting of \"jobs created\" and \"jobs retained\" as those terms are used in such Act."
