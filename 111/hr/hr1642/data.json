Gives priority to grant applications that demonstrate a need or hardship. Requires the Secretary to consult with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to determine if there are loan programs or other funds available for such retrofitting. Authorizes the Secretary to evaluate where a nursing facility may not have an adequate structure to retrofit the entire facility within a reasonable timeframe and work with the facility to identify other remedial actions."
