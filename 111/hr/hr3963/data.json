Excuses existing federal air marshals who have previously completed such program from repeating it. Requires any air marshal hired before the enactment of this Act who has not completed the program, however, to complete an alternative training program, as determined by the Federal Law Enforcement Center, that provides the training necessary to bridge the gap between the mixed basic police training, the federal air marshal programs already completed by the federal air marshal, and the training provided through the criminal investigative training program. Deems any such alternative program to have met the standards of the criminal investigative training program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010 and FY2011."
