Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) increase to $200,000 and make permanent the expensing allowance (i.e., a tax deduction in the current taxable year) for depreciable business assets; (2) increase the threshold for phaseout of such allowance to $800,000 (the cost basis of property placed in service); (3) allow an inflation adjustment to the expensing and threshold amounts after 2009; (4) make permanent the right of a taxpayer to revoke an election to expense business assets; (5) make permanent the inclusion of certain computer software as property eligible for expensing; and (6) allow self-employment health insurance costs as a deduction in determining net self-employment income."
