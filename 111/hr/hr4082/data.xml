  <summary>11/16/2009--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program for paying certain affected participants a one-time lump sum payment. Defines affected participants as persons who retired from active employment at one of the gaseous diffusion plants of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC), or are employed by USEC's operating contractor, on or before its privatization date as vested participants in a pension plan maintained either by USEC's operating contractor or by a contractor employed prior to July 1, 1993, by the Department of Energy to operate a gaseous diffusion plant. Prescribes a formula for the determination of such payments, based on the total recoverable amount of accrued pension benefits.</summary>
