Defines a "covered energy project" as any action or decision by a federal official regarding: (1) the leasing of federal land (including submerged land) for the exploration, development, production, processing, or transmission of oil, natural gas, or any other source or form of energy; or (2) any action under such a lease. Sets forth deadlines for filing and resolving such claims.</summary>
