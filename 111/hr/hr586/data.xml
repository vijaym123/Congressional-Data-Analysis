  <summary>5/12/2009--Public Law.
Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009 - Requires, within the limits of available funds, the Librarian of Congress and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution (acting through the Director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture) to establish an oral history project to: (1) collect video and audio recordings of, and visual and written materials relevant to the personal histories of, participants in the Civil Rights movement; and (2) make the collection available for public use through the Library of Congress and the Museum. Defines, for this Act, "Civil Rights movement" as the movement to secure racial equality in the United States for African Americans that, focusing on the period 1954 through 1968, challenged the practice of racial segregation in the nation and achieved equal rights legislation for all American citizens. Encourages the Librarian and the Secretary to solicit and accept related donations of funds and in-kind contributions. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
