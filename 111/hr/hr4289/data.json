Provides for the obtaining, exercise, and protection of U.S. water rights for the wilderness and potential wilderness areas. Designates specified lands (proposed as Deep Creek Wilderness and Pisgah Mountain Wilderness) as potential wilderness areas. Requires such lands to be designated as wilderness upon publication of a notice that all nonconforming uses of those lands have ceased."
