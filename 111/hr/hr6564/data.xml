  <summary>12/21/2010--Introduced.
Oil Independence for a Stronger America Act of 2010 - Establishes in the Executive Office of the President a national energy security program to coordinate federal activities and policies to reduce oil consumption by 8 million barrels per day by calendar 2030. Directs the President to develop a national oil independence plan to meet or exceed such goal. Establishes also in the Executive Office a National Energy Security Council to assist and advise the President in setting and meeting the national oil independence goal. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate joint regulations establishing fuel efficiency standards and greenhouse gas emissions limitations to maximize reductions in oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for each class of automobiles subject to fuel economy regulations and manufactured for each of model years 2017 through 2030 and for nonroad vehicles. Establishes within the Department of Energy (DOE) a national plug-in electric drive vehicle deployment program and a targeted electric drive vehicle deployment communities program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and publish guidance for model building codes for the inclusion of separate circuits for charging infrastructure in new construction and major renovations of private residences, buildings, or other structures; and (2) award grants to institutions to provide training and education for vocational workforce development to ensure skills needed to work on and maintain plug-in electric drive vehicles and the infrastructure required to support them. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow a refundable personal tax credit to a qualified deployment community taxpayer who purchases a new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle and resides in a selected deployment community; (2) revise the new qualified hybrid motor vehicle credit; and (3) extend and revise the credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property. Creates tax-exempt qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle refueling property bonds. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to authorize the Secretary to make guarantees for charging infrastructure and networks of charging infrastructure for plug-in drive electric vehicles, if the infrastructure will be operational prior to December 31, 2016. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to require each electric utility to develop a plan to support the use of plug-in electric drive vehicles. Requires the Federal Energy Management Program and the General Services Administration (GSA) to assess the conversion of federal government fleets to plug-in electric drive vehicles. Directs the GSA Administrator to acquire such vehicles and charging infrastructure and deploy them in a range of locations in the federal fleet. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish the Advanced Batteries for Tomorrow Prize to advance research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of a 500-mile vehicle battery. Creates in the Treasury a 500-mile Battery Fund. Requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a research and development funding program for advanced batteries, plug-in electric drive vehicle components, plug-in electric drive infrastructure, and other related technologies. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study and report to Congress on: (1) the raw materials needed for the manufacture of components for plug-in electric drive vehicles; and (2) the infrastructure needed to support such vehicles. Establishes the Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Technical Advisory Committee. Directs the President to establish the Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Interagency Task Force. Requires disposal of an advanced battery from a plug-in electric drive vehicle in accordance with the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to direct the Secretary of Energy to guarantee loans to eligible entities for the aggregate purchase of not fewer than 200 qualified automotive batteries (designed for use in qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles but purchased for nonautomotive applications) in a calendar year with a total minimum power rating of one megawatt and advanced battery technology. Directs the Secretary to develop and publish model building codes for the inclusion of separate circuits for charging infrastructure in new construction and major renovations of private residences, buildings, or other structures; (2) model construction permitting or inspection processes that allow for the expedited installation of charging infrastructure for purchasers of plug-in electric drive vehicles; and (3) model zoning, parking rules, or other local ordinances that facilitate the installation of, and access to, charging infrastructure. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for grid-interactive plug-in vehicles. Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for a study of the data that may be collected from plug-in electric drive vehicles. Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the EPA Administrator to promulgate regulations to establish: (1) national transportation-related goals for reducing oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) standardized models and related methods for states, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and air quality agencies to address oil savings and emission reduction goals. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations concerning the consideration of oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in transportation planning. Requires metropolitan planning areas and states to develop surface transportation-related oil savings and greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, as well as strategies to meet those targets. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to distribute funds to states and MPOs for investing in transportation greenhouse gas emission reduction programs. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase to $230 the amount of qualified transportation fringe (commuter) benefits excluded from an employee's gross income. Makes it the goal of the United States to shift at least 10% of freight shipped by truck to rail or marine shipping by calendar 2020. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop a national freight transportation options plan; and (2) make grants to states for the capital costs of facilities, infrastructure, and equipment for high priority rail corridor projects necessary to reduce congestion in freight rail transportation. Requires the Comptroller General to study and report on the benefits and costs of electrification of rail corridors. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an investment tax credit for advanced biofuel facilities as well as grants in lieu of credits for advanced biofuel facility property (under division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009). Includes algae-based biofuel in the definition of cellulosic biofuel. Extends: (1) the cellulosic biofuel producer credit; (2) the special allowance for cellulosic biofuel plant property; (3) certain credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel; (4) alcohol fuels tax credits; and (5) alternative fuel excise tax credits. Allows a tax credit for qualified natural gas motor vehicles and creates tax-exempt natural gas vehicle bonds. Allows an expensing deduction for manufacturing facilities producing vehicles fueled by compressed or liquefied natural gas. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations for environmental best management practices of oil and gas operators on federal lands. Directs the GSA Administrator to study and report to Congress on means of increasing the number of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas vehicles in the federal fleet. Establishes in DOE an Energy Efficiency Improvement for Heating Oil, Propane, and Kerosene Program to fund state participation in programs operated by a national oilheat research alliance or the Propane Education and Research Council to carry out cost-effective energy efficiency programs for homes and buildings that use home heating oil, propane, and kerosene. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a renewable biomass thermal energy loan program of grants to states to support financial assistance by qualified program delivery entities to replace with certain wood or wood-pellet fired boilers any thermal energy systems in commercial or multifamily residential buildings that use heating oil or another petroleum product. Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to: (1) extend the placed-in-service dates applicable to specified alternative energy property eligible for grants in lieu of tax credits; and (2) allow such grants to state utilities with service obligations and mutual or cooperative electric companies.</summary>
