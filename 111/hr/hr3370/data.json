Amends federal merchant marine law and the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow capital construction funds to be used for maintenance or repair of vessels documented under the laws of the United States; (2) establish the order of withdrawal for purposes of the tax treatment of qualified withdrawals from such funds; and (3) disallow a basis reduction for maintenance or repair withdrawals."
