Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a process by which an individual or entity may transmit EDR data to the Secretary; and (2) create an EDR database for research and analysis. Directs the Secretary to promulgate a rule that requires each motor vehicle manufacturer to ensure that the data recorded by an EDR in a motor vehicle manufactured before model year 2012 is capable of being read by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Prohibits the retrieval of data stored in an EDR by any person other than the owner or lessee of the motor vehicle in which such device is installed, unless: (1) a court authorizes it, the owner or lessee consents, or the data is retrieved by a government motor vehicle safety agency; and (2) neither the personally identifiable information of the vehicle owner, lessee,or occupant nor the vehicle identification number (VIN) is publicly disclosed in connection with the data."
