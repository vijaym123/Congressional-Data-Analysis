  <summary>12/9/2010--Introduced.
Allows veterans' educational benefits that are transferred to an intellectually or developmentally disabled dependent to be used for special education, even if the dependent has not earned a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate. Directs the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations to determine whether those dependents must enroll in the exceptional family member program of the Department of Defense (DOD). Prohibits payment of the monthly stipend to such dependents if the Secretary determines that it is not relevant to their special education. Prohibits this Act's special education benefits from affecting a dependent's receipt of, or eligibility for, other federal educational benefits.</summary>
