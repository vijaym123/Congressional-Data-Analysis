Directs the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations to determine whether those dependents must enroll in the exceptional family member program of the Department of Defense (DOD). Prohibits payment of the monthly stipend to such dependents if the Secretary determines that it is not relevant to their special education. Prohibits this Act's special education benefits from affecting a dependent's receipt of, or eligibility for, other federal educational benefits."
