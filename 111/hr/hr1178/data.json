Directs the Comptroller General's report to include assessments of: (1) the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using Civil Air Patrol assets; and (2) whether current mechanisms for requesting support from the Civil Air Patrol are sufficient. Requires the Secretary to analyze the study and report to the committees any recommendations for action that could affect DHS's organization and administration."
