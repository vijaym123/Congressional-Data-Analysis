Repeals the Secretary's authority to extend the TARP program through October 3, 2010, upon submission of a written certification to Congress. Requires all funds repaid, and profits paid, to the Secretary by TARP recipients to be used to pay down the national debt. Reduces the statutory limit on the public debt to $700 billion minus the amount of troubled assets purchased by the Secretary under TARP outstanding on December 31, 2009."
