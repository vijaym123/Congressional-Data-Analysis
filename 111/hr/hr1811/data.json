Requires the projects to be approved and authorized to proceed upon a written finding by the President (or the designee) that they serve the public interest in responsible domestic oil and gas development and comply with federal laws. Shields decisions of the President from further administrative or judicial review, stay, or injunction, except with respect to an appeal filed by the applicant or permittee. Declares that the President's (or designee's) determinations pre-empt any state law."
