Requires the Commission to make recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation in the form of a Commuter Bill of Rights which includes: (1) a list of situations in which a provider of public transportation will implement its contingency plan during an emergency; (2) recommendations for minimum standards that a plan must meet, including the provision of food, water, restrooms, ventilation, and medical services, as well as the distribution of certain critical information to commuters on a disabled or delayed train or other transit vehicle; and (3) recommendations for federal regulations on commuter safety during emergencies. Authorizes the Secretary to provide competitive grants to providers of public transportation to develop and implement contingency plans that fulfill the Bill of Rights. Requires the Secretary to review the Bill of Rights and issue regulations to require providers of public transportation to comply with the Bill's recommended standards. Requires the Secretary to use the Bill of Rights to develop related federal policies. Authorizes the Secretary to assess penalties or sanctions against providers of public transportation who fail to submit, obtain approval of, or adhere to its contingency plan. Requires the Secretary to establish a consumer hotline telephone number for public transportation complaints."
