Requires projects to be publicly owned as a prerequisite for assistance. Directs the Secretary to enter into local cooperation agreements with non-federal interests for project design and construction. Sets the federal share of project costs under local cooperation agreements at 75%. Sets the non-federal share of operation and maintenance costs for projects constructed with assistance under this Act at 100%."
