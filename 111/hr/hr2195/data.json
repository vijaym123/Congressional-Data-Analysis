Amends the Federal Power Act to direct the Secretary to make ongoing assessments and provide periodic reports with respect to: (1) cyber vulnerabilities or threats to critical infrastructure, including critical electric infrastructure and advanced metering infrastructure; and (2) the enhancement of domestic preparedness for a cyber attack. Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish mandatory interim measures to protect against known cyber vulnerabilities or threats to the operation of the critical electric infrastructure in the United States. Amends the the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary to evaluate the capacity and authority of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other federal agencies to ensure the security against a cyber attack and resilience of electronic devices and communication networks essential to the critical infrastructure sectors."
