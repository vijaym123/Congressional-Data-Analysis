Amends the United States Housing Act of 1939 to set the payment standard for a market area efficiency dwelling unit as the standard for rent subsidies under Section 8 of the housing voucher program for one-person households. Prohibits the use of the payment standard for a one-bedroom dwelling unit or any larger dwelling unit. OPIC Repeal Act - Abolishes the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and makes conforming amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961."
