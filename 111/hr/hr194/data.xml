  <summary>1/6/2009--Introduced.
MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2009 - Amends the Social Security Act to establish the MediKids program to guarantee comprehensive health coverage for all children born after 2009. Creates in the Treasury the MediKids Trust Fund. Expands the duties of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC). Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) impose on all except very low-income taxpayers a MediKids premium; and (2) create a refundable tax credit providing a catastrophic limit on cost-sharing expenses. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to propose a gradual schedule of progressive tax changes to fund the Medikids program, as the number of enrollees grows in the out-years. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to identify and publish for general comment an initial, recommended core set of child health quality measures for use under the MediKids Program, by state programs administered under titles XIX (Medicaid) and XXI (State Children's Health Insurance) (SCHIP) of the Social Security Act, health insurance issuers and managed care entities that enter into contracts with such programs, and providers of items and services. Directs the Secretary to establish a pediatric quality measures program. Directs the Secretary to award up to 10 grants to states and child health providers to conduct demonstration projects to evaluate promising ideas for improving the quality of children's health care. Directs the Secretary to conduct a demonstration project to develop a comprehensive and systematic model for reducing childhood obesity. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to encourage the development and dissemination of a model electronic health record format for children. Directs the Institute of Medicine to study and report to Congress on efforts to measure child health status and the quality of health care. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to specified congressional committees on children's access to primary and speciality services under Medicaid, CHIP, and MediKids. Requires application of certain managed care quality safeguards to SCHIP.</summary>
