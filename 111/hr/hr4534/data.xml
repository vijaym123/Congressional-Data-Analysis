  <summary>1/27/2010--Introduced.
Requires a restroom in a public building to be a family restroom (e.g., specifically equipped to accommodate use by men and women for the purpose of changing the diaper of a child and aiding a child in the restroom) or otherwise to be equipped with baby changing facilities that the Administrator of General Services (GSA) determines are physically safe, sanitary, and appropriate. Makes this requirement inapplicable to a restroom that: (1) is not available for public use; or (2) contains clear and conspicuous signage indicating where a family restroom is located within the same section or corridor of such building.</summary>
