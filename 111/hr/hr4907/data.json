    "text": "Energy Innovation Hubs Authorization Act of 2010 - Requires the Secretary of Energy to: (1) implement a program to enhance the nation's economic, environmental, and energy security by making grants to nonprofit consortia for establishing and operating Energy Innovation Hubs to conduct and support multidisciplinary, collaborative research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of advanced energy technologies in areas not being served by the private sector; (2) designate for each Hub a unique advanced energy technology development focus; (3) ensure the coordination of the Hub activities with those of other Department of Energy (DOE) research entities; and (4) establish and maintain within DOE an Oversight Board to oversee the progress of Hubs. Requires each Hub to establish: (1) an advisory committee to provide guidance on scientific, technical, industry, financial, and research management matters; and (2) procedures to ensure that employees and consortia designees for Hub activities who are in decision-making capacities disclose all material conflicts of interest. Prohibits grant funding from being used for construction of new buildings or facilities for Hubs. Provides that construction of new buildings or facilities is not considered to be part of the non-federal share of a Hub cost-sharing agreement. Defines advanced energy technology to mean an innovative technology: (1) that produces energy from solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, tidal, wave, ocean, or other renewable energy resources; (2) that produces nuclear energy; (3) for carbon capture and sequestration; or (4) that generates, transmits, distributes, utilizes, or stores energy more efficiently than conventional technologies."
