    "text": "Grow American Supply Act - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) with respect to Adjacent Zones and Planning Areas in the outer Continental Shelf (OCS) subsoil and seabed. Revises procedures governing natural gas lease administration. Requires deposit of a portion of OCS receipts from certain new leases into a Special Dedicated Account in the Social Security Trust Fund to reduce Social Security debt. Establishes the Deficit Reduction Trust Fund to accept specified OCS receipts to reduce the federal debt. Prohibits oil and gas leasing east of the Military Mission Line. Cites conditions for granting a federal permit to construct a crude oil or petroleum products pipeline without adjacent state concurrence within the part of the adjacent state's Adjacent Zone that is withdrawn from oil and gas or natural gas leasing. Exempts lease suspensions and preliminary activities on OCS tracts from the requirement to prepare statutory environmental assessments or impact statements. Prohibits construction or operation of any facility, or designation or maintainance of a restricted transportation corridor or operating area, on the federal OCS or in state waters that will be incompatible with oil and gas or natural gas leasing and substantially full exploration and production of tracts that are geologically prospective for oil or natural gas. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to repurchase and cancel specified leases. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to revise regulations governing onshore surface-disturbing activities. Rigs to Reefs Act of 2009 - Amends OCSLA to prescribe requirements for the use of decommissioned offshore oil and gas platforms for artificial reefs. Instructs the Secretary to establish: (1) OCS regional headquarters for the Atlantic and the Pacific OCS region; and (2) Federal OCS Joint Regional Permitting Offices. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to set royalty rates for leases for oil shale and tar sands. Repeals the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require regulations that promote: (1) production of natural gas from gas hydrates; and (2) enhanced oil and natural gas production through carbon dioxide injection. Sets forth: (1) minimum rental rates for future oil, gas, and coal federal leases; and (2) onshore oil and gas royalties."
