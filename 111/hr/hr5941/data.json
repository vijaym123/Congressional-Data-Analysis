Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the Department of the Treasury, to: (1) establish a mortgage application recordation system which includes a clearinghouse, managed by a private sector entity, to record single-family residence mortgage applications; and (2) require mortgage originators to record such credit applications with the clearinghouse. Prescribes criteria for the clearinghouse operator, which shall bear all clearinghouse costs. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee repayment of principal and interest on a loan to the clearinghouse operator sufficient to cover clearinghouse costs. Requires the clearinghouse to collect information using an Internet-based electronic system. Makes all information collected by the clearinghouse is property of the Secretary."
