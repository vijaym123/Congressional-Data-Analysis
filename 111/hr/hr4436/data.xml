  <summary>1/13/2010--Introduced.
Belarus Arms Transfers Accountability Act of 2009 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Secretary of State should consider reports of arms sales by Belarus to state sponsors of terrorism and states that do not cooperate with the United States in its anti-terrorism efforts, as well as any information gathered for a certain congressional report concerning Belarus' proliferation of conventional and nuclear weapons to such countries, including Venezuela, in determining whether to impose terrorism and nonproliferation sanctions to deter such arms sales by Belarus; and (2) any use by Iran of nuclear cooperation agreements with other countries as a means to proliferate weapons technology and expertise to countries such as Venezuela, either directly or by arrangements with Belarus or other countries, would not be in the interest of the United States. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on exports of weapons and related services by the government of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises, especially to state sponsors of terrorism or countries not fully cooperating with U.S. antiterrorism efforts, including Venezuela.</summary>
