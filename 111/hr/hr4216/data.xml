  <summary>12/7/2009--Introduced.
Personal Health Record Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, in developing a nationwide health information technology infrastructure, to allow individuals to access their individually identifiable health information. Requires the inclusion in the Federal Health IT Strategic Plan objectives, milestones, and metrics related to the interoperability of a personal health record with an electronic health record (EHR). Directs the National Coordinator to develop guidelines for making EHRs interoperable with personal health records for the purpose of improving health care quality, reducing medical errors, and advancing the delivery of patient-centered medical care and health management. Requires the National Coordinator to report to the appropriate congressional committees on: (1) personal health records, including the extent to which the use of personal health records improve communication between individuals and covered entities and improve patient health management; and (2) issues related to an individual's control of the personal health record. Requires the HIT Policy Committee to make recommendations for standards and implementation specifications for the interoperability of personal health records and EHRs. Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to establish as an eligibility requirement for an incentive payment for the meaningful use of EHR technology that a health professional, hospital, or Medicaid provider must demonstrate the availability of certified EHR technology to and use of such technology by individuals furnished items and services by such professional, hospital, or provider in the form of electronic and personal health records.</summary>
