Terminates such entitlement when a person knowingly provides written notice of the intent not to return to such position following treatment. Allows the absent employee to use any vacation, annual, medical, or similar leave with pay accrued before the commencement of the treatment. Provides that an employer shall not be required to comply with the requirements of this Act if: (1) the employer's circumstances have so changed as to make such compliance impossible or unreasonable; (2) such compliance would pose an undue hardship on the employer; or (3) the employment in question is for a brief, nonrecurring period without a reasonable expectation of continuing indefinitely or for a significant period. Applies health insurance continuation requirements to absences from employment described in this Act. Prohibits any employer discrimination or acts of reprisal against an absent employee."
