  <summary>3/2/2010--Introduced.
Increased Program Access Act - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to reimburse summer food service programs for children in service institutions and food programs for children in afterschool care for free meals or snacks served to children in areas where at least 40% (currently, 50%) of the children meet the income eligibility criteria for free or reduced price meals under the school lunch and breakfast programs. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to award competitive grants to service institutions to increase participation at congregate feeding sites in summer food service programs for children through innovative approaches to limited transportation in underserved areas.</summary>
