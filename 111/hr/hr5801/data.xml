  <summary>7/20/2010--Introduced.
Directs Amtrak to ensure that fares charged for sleeper class service on all Amtrak long-distance routes are priced to equal all of the operating costs for providing such service. Requires Amtrak to discontinue such service in cases where total service costs exceed total revenues for the service for the first full fiscal year beginning after enactment of this Act. Prohibits Amtrak from using federal funds to subsidize sleeper class service.</summary>
