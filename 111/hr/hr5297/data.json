Reduces SBA participation in a loan on a deferred basis, after December 31, 2010, from 90% back to: (1) 75% of a loan balance exceeding $150,000; and (2) 85% of a loan balance equal to or less than $150,000.

(Sec. 1114) Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to extend through December 31, 2010: (1) the reduction or elimination of certain fees related to SBA loan guarantees; and (2) the Economic Stimulus Lending Program to guarantee up to 90% of qualifying small business loans made by eligible lenders. (Sec. 1115) Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to apply single-business investment limits to SBA-recognized new markets venture capital companies of 10% of the sum of a company's regulatory capital plus the total amount of leverage projected in the participation agreement.

(Sec. 1117) Directs the SBA Administrator, upon pool assembler request, if the amount of the guaranteed portion of any loan under the section 7(a) general small business loan program is more than $500,000, to divide the loan guarantee into increments of $500,000 and 1 increment of any remaining amount less than $500,000, in order to permit the maximum amount of any loan in a pool to be not more than $500,000. Allows increments of loan guarantees to different borrowers that are so divided to be included in the same pool. (Sec. 1118) Expresses the sense of Congress that the SBA Administrator should establish a website that: (1) lists SBA lenders and provides loan rate information, and (2) allows prospective borrowers to compare rates on SBA-guaranteed loans. (Sec. 1119) Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to terminate the authority of the Administrator regarding the Secondary Market Guarantee Authority two years after the date of the first sale of a pool of first lien position 504 loans guaranteed to a third-party investor. Part II: Small Business Access to Capital - (Sec. 1122) Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 regarding the local development business loan program to allow a small business borrower to refinance a previous business debt: (1) that was incurred at least two years before the loan application; (2) that is a commercial loan; (3) that is not guaranteed by a federal agency; (4) whose proceeds were used to acquire a fixed asset for the business's benefit; (5) that is collateralized by fixed assets; and (6) for which the borrower has been current on all payments for at least one year. Allows the Administrator to provide financing under such program for a project that does not involve small business expansion, if the borrower meets certain job creation or retention goals. Prescribes an alternate job retention goal for which a borrower may qualify. Part III: Other Matters - (Sec. 1131) Establishes a three-year pilot program of direct loans to private, nonprofit entities (intermediaries), which shall in turn make loans of up to $200,000 each to startup, newly established, and growing small businesses for working capital, real estate, or the acquisition of materials, supplies, or equipment.

Requires each qualified issuer to establish a risk-share pool, capitalized by contributions from eligible community development financial institution participants of an amount equal to 3% of the guaranteed amount outstanding on the such notes and bonds. Authorizes appropriations through FY2014. (Sec. 1135) Raises temporarily, for only one year, the maximum amount of an express loan from $350,000 to $1 million.

Requires the Associate Administrator to establish annual goals. Directs the Associate Administrator to appoint at least one trade financial specialist within the SBA to oversee international loan programs and assist SBA employees with trade finance issues. Directs the SBA Administrator to: (1) establish an export and trade counseling certification program for employees of lead small business development centers and lead women's business centers; and (2) ensure that each lead small business development center has at least 10% of its employees (with a minimum of 5 employees) certified in providing export assistance. Requires the Associate Administrator to develop performance measures to support small business export growth goals for Office activities.

Requires at least three specialists in each SBA region. Directs the SBA Administrator to study for each state: (1) its volume of exports; (2) the availability of export finance specialists; (3) the number as well as percentage of exporters that are small business concerns; (4) changes, if any, in the number of exporters that are small business concerns at 10-year intervals; (5) the total value of the exports by small business concerns; and (6) the percentage of the total volume of exports attributable to small business concerns, and changes, if any, in those percentages at 10-year intervals. Requires recommendations to Congress on how to eliminate gaps between the supply of and demand for export finance specialists in the 15 states with the greatest volume of exports as well as in the 15 states with the lowest volume of exports. (Sec. 1206) Increases from $1.75 million to $4.5 million the total amount of a small business loan outstanding and committed (by participation or otherwise) to the borrower from the business loan and investment fund. Increases from $1.25 million to $4 million the limit on the use of such a loan for working capital, supplies, or financings. Caps SBA participation in an international trade loan at 90%. Authorizes the SBA to make a guaranteed loan for working capital that will allow an eligible small business concern engaged in or adversely affected by international trade to improve its competitive position. Allows such a loan to be secured by a second lien position on the property or equipment financed by the loan or on other assets of the small business concern, if the lien gives adequate assurance of the payment of the loan. (Currently, a first lien position or first mortgage on the property, equipment, or other business assets is required.) Names the foreign market development loan guarantee program the Export Working Capital Program, allowing a maximum loan guarantee of $5 million. Makes eligible to participate in the Preferred Lenders Program any lender participating in the Delegated Authority Lender Program of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Establishes the Export Express Program to authorize the SBA Administrator to guarantee loans to small businesses for export development activities. Requires the guarantee of 90% of a loan of up to $350,000, and 75% of a higher loan up to $500,000.

(Sec. 1209) Requires a small business development center that counsels a small business concern on international trade issues to: (1) consult with state trade agencies and Export Assistance Centers to provide appropriate services to the small business concern; and (2) refer the small business concern to a state trade agency or an Export Assistance Center, as necessary, for further counseling or assistance. Subtitle C: Small Business Contracting - Part I: Contract Bundling - (Sec. 1312) Amends the Small Business Act to require each federal agency to include in each solicitation for any multiple award contract above the agency's substantial bundling threshold a provision soliciting bids from any responsible source, including responsible small business concerns and teams or joint ventures of small business concerns. Directs the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to amend a specified Federal Acquisition Regulation to: (1) establish a Government-wide policy regarding contract bundling, including the solicitation of teaming and joint ventures; and (2) require that such policy be published on each federal agency website. Requires the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to report triennially to certain congressional committees regarding procurement center representatives and commercial market representatives, including the identification of each area to which the SBA has assigned such a representative. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the procurement center representative program. Instructs the Administrator to implement a 3-year pilot electronic procurement center representative program. (Sec. 1313) Directs the head of each federal agency to ensure that its decisions regarding consolidation of contract requirements are made with a view to providing small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors. Prohibits a federal agency head from carrying out an acquisition strategy that includes a consolidation of contract requirements with a value of more than $2 million unless the senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer first conducts market research, identifying alternative contracting approaches involving a lesser degree of consolidation of contract requirements, and certifying that steps will be taken to include small business concerns in the acquisition strategy. Authorizes a senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer to determine that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified if the benefits of the acquisition strategy substantially exceed the benefits of alternative contracting approaches. (Sec. 1314) Directs the Administrator to establish a Small Business Teaming Pilot Program of grants to eligible organizations to assist and guide to teams or joint ventures of small business concerns seeking to compete for larger procurement contracts. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2015. Part II: Subcontracting Integrity - (Sec. 1321) Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations relating to, and the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to establish a policy on, subcontracting compliance relating to small business concerns, including assignment of compliance responsibilities among contracting offices, small business offices, and program offices and periodic oversight and review. Part III: Acquisition Process - (Sec. 1331) Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to establish regulatory guidance under which federal agencies may, at their discretion, set aside part or parts of a multiple award contract, and reserve contract awards, for small business concerns, including the subcategories of small business concerns. (Sec. 1332) Instructs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidelines regarding the analysis of purchase card expenditures to identify opportunities for achieving and accurately measuring fair participation of small business concerns in purchases in an amount not exceeding the micro-purchase threshold. (Sec. 1334) Requires a prime contractor for a covered contract to notify in writing the relevant contracting officer if: (1) the prime contractor pays a reduced price to a subcontractor for goods and services, or (2) the payment to a subcontractor is more than 90 days past due for goods or services provided for the covered contract for which the federal agency has paid the prime contractor. (Sec. 1335) Amends the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 to repeal authority for the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. Part IV: Small Business Size and Status Integrity - (Sec. 1341) States a presumption that, in every contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement, or grant which is classified as intended for award to small business concerns, there shall be a loss to the United States based on the total amount expended on such instrument whenever a non-small business concern willfully sought and received the award by misrepresentation. (Sec. 1342) Requires each certified small business concern to certify its size and small business status annually by means of a confirming entry on the SBA Online Representations and Certifications Application database. (Sec. 1343) Requires the Federal Acquisition Institute to develop courses for acquisition personnel concerning proper classification of business concerns and small business size and status for purposes of federal contracts, subcontracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and cooperative research and development agreements. (Sec. 1344) Requires the Administrator to conduct a rolling detailed review, every 18 months, of updated size standards for small business concerns, including at least 2 public forums located in different U.S. geographic regions. (Sec. 1345) Directs Comptroller General to study the mentor-protege program for small business concerns participating in certain SBA programs, as well as other relationships and strategic alliances pairing a larger business and a small business concern partner to gain access to federal government contracts, to determine whether the programs and relationships are effectively supporting the goal of increasing the participation of small business concerns in federal contracting. Subtitle D: Small Business Management and Counseling Assistance - (Sec. 1401) Authorizes the Administrator, upon request by an intermediary, to waive the requirement to obtain non-federal funds for a fiscal year, including successive fiscal years. Prohibits the Administrator from waiving the requirement to obtain such funds if granting the waiver would undermine the credibility of the microloan program. (Sec. 1402) Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to small business development centers to provide targeted technical assistance to small business concerns seeking access to capital or credit, federal procurement opportunities, energy efficiency audits to reduce energy bills, opportunities to export products or provide services to foreign customers, adopting, making innovations in, and using broadband technologies, or other assistance. Exempts grant recipients from the requirement to provide non-federal matching funds. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle E: Disaster Loan Improvement - (Sec. 1501) Authorizes the Administrator to provide disaster assistance to aquaculture enterprises that are small businesses.
