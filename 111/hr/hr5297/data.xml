  <summary>9/27/2010--Public Law.
Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 - Title I: Small Businesses - Subtitle A: Small Business Access to Credit - Small Business Job Creation and Access to Capital Act of 2010 - Part I: Next Steps for Main Street Credit Availability - (Sec. 1111) Amends the Small Business Act to increase temporarily (until January 1, 2011) to 90% the maximum Small Business Administration (SBA) participation in a loan on a deferred basis under the section 7(a) (general small business loans) guaranteed loan program. Reduces SBA participation in a loan on a deferred basis, after December 31, 2010, from 90% back to: (1) 75% of a loan balance exceeding $150,000; and (2) 85% of a loan balance equal to or less than $150,000. Raises from $1.5 million to $4.5 million (through December 31, 2010, after which only to $3.75 million) the ceiling on the total amount outstanding and committed (by participation or otherwise) to the borrower from the business loan and investment fund. Raises from $2 million to $5 million the maximum gross loan amount. Raises from $1.5 million to $5 million the maximum loan amounts for the section 504 (state and local development company) program. Increases from $35,000 to $50,000 the maximum amount of a microloan (to a start-up, newly-established, and growing small business) under the Microloan program. Increases from $3.5 million to $5 million the maximum total amount of loans to one intermediary participating in the Microloan program. (Sec. 1114) Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to extend through December 31, 2010: (1) the reduction or elimination of certain fees related to SBA loan guarantees; and (2) the Economic Stimulus Lending Program to guarantee up to 90% of qualifying small business loans made by eligible lenders. (Sec. 1115) Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to apply single-business investment limits to SBA-recognized new markets venture capital companies of 10% of the sum of a company's regulatory capital plus the total amount of leverage projected in the participation agreement. (Sec. 1116) Directs the SBA Administrator to establish for prospective borrowers an alternative small business size standard that uses maximum tangible net worth and average net income as an alternative to the use of industry standards. (Sec. 1117) Directs the SBA Administrator, upon pool assembler request, if the amount of the guaranteed portion of any loan under the section 7(a) general small business loan program is more than $500,000, to divide the loan guarantee into increments of $500,000 and 1 increment of any remaining amount less than $500,000, in order to permit the maximum amount of any loan in a pool to be not more than $500,000. Allows increments of loan guarantees to different borrowers that are so divided to be included in the same pool. (Sec. 1118) Expresses the sense of Congress that the SBA Administrator should establish a website that: (1) lists SBA lenders and provides loan rate information, and (2) allows prospective borrowers to compare rates on SBA-guaranteed loans. (Sec. 1119) Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to terminate the authority of the Administrator regarding the Secondary Market Guarantee Authority two years after the date of the first sale of a pool of first lien position 504 loans guaranteed to a third-party investor. Part II: Small Business Access to Capital - (Sec. 1122) Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 regarding the local development business loan program to allow a small business borrower to refinance a previous business debt: (1) that was incurred at least two years before the loan application; (2) that is a commercial loan; (3) that is not guaranteed by a federal agency; (4) whose proceeds were used to acquire a fixed asset for the business's benefit; (5) that is collateralized by fixed assets; and (6) for which the borrower has been current on all payments for at least one year. Allows the Administrator to provide financing under such program for a project that does not involve small business expansion, if the borrower meets certain job creation or retention goals. Prescribes an alternate job retention goal for which a borrower may qualify. Part III: Other Matters - (Sec. 1131) Establishes a three-year pilot program of direct loans to private, nonprofit entities (intermediaries), which shall in turn make loans of up to $200,000 each to startup, newly established, and growing small businesses for working capital, real estate, or the acquisition of materials, supplies, or equipment. (Sec. 1133) Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the SBA Administrator to guarantee the timely payment of an open-end extension of credit to a small business concern, the proceeds of which may be used for the purchase of eligible retail goods for resale (floor plan pilot program extension). (Sec. 1134) Amends the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to guarantee payments on bonds or notes issued by a qualified issuer, if their proceeds are used to make loans to eligible community development financial institutions for eligible community or economic development purposes or to refinance loans or notes issued for such purposes. Requires each qualified issuer to establish a risk-share pool, capitalized by contributions from eligible community development financial institution participants of an amount equal to 3% of the guaranteed amount outstanding on the such notes and bonds. Authorizes appropriations through FY2014. (Sec. 1135) Raises temporarily, for only one year, the maximum amount of an express loan from $350,000 to $1 million. (Sec. 1136) Prohibits the use of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 or tax increases during 2010 to carry out specified sections of the loan programs under this Act. Subtitle B: Small Business Trade and Exporting - Small Business Export Enhancement and International Trade Act of 2010 - (Sec. 1201) Amends the Small Business Act to: (1) require the SBA Office of International Trade to implement export promotion programs that increase the number of small businesses that export as well as the volume of their exports; and (2) establish an Associate Administrator for International Trade as the head of the Office. (Sec. 1204) Requires the Associate Administrator in promoting export assistance programs through SBA district and regional offices, the small business development center network, Export Assistance Centers (one-stop shops for U.S. exporters), the network of women's business centers, chapters of the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), state and local export promotion programs, and partners in the private sector. Requires the Associate Administrator to establish annual goals. Directs the Associate Administrator to appoint at least one trade financial specialist within the SBA to oversee international loan programs and assist SBA employees with trade finance issues. Directs the SBA Administrator to: (1) establish an export and trade counseling certification program for employees of lead small business development centers and lead women's business centers; and (2) ensure that each lead small business development center has at least 10% of its employees (with a minimum of 5 employees) certified in providing export assistance. Requires the Associate Administrator to develop performance measures to support small business export growth goals for Office activities. (Sec. 1205) Directs the SBA Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, to ensure that the number of export finance specialists assigned to the Export Assistance Centers is at least the number that were assigned on January 1, 2003. Requires at least three specialists in each SBA region. Directs the SBA Administrator to study for each state: (1) its volume of exports; (2) the availability of export finance specialists; (3) the number as well as percentage of exporters that are small business concerns; (4) changes, if any, in the number of exporters that are small business concerns at 10-year intervals; (5) the total value of the exports by small business concerns; and (6) the percentage of the total volume of exports attributable to small business concerns, and changes, if any, in those percentages at 10-year intervals. Requires recommendations to Congress on how to eliminate gaps between the supply of and demand for export finance specialists in the 15 states with the greatest volume of exports as well as in the 15 states with the lowest volume of exports. (Sec. 1206) Increases from $1.75 million to $4.5 million the total amount of a small business loan outstanding and committed (by participation or otherwise) to the borrower from the business loan and investment fund. Increases from $1.25 million to $4 million the limit on the use of such a loan for working capital, supplies, or financings. Caps SBA participation in an international trade loan at 90%. Authorizes the SBA to make a guaranteed loan for working capital that will allow an eligible small business concern engaged in or adversely affected by international trade to improve its competitive position. Allows such a loan to be secured by a second lien position on the property or equipment financed by the loan or on other assets of the small business concern, if the lien gives adequate assurance of the payment of the loan. (Currently, a first lien position or first mortgage on the property, equipment, or other business assets is required.) Names the foreign market development loan guarantee program the Export Working Capital Program, allowing a maximum loan guarantee of $5 million. Makes eligible to participate in the Preferred Lenders Program any lender participating in the Delegated Authority Lender Program of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Establishes the Export Express Program to authorize the SBA Administrator to guarantee loans to small businesses for export development activities. Requires the guarantee of 90% of a loan of up to $350,000, and 75% of a higher loan up to $500,000. Directs the SBA Administrator to publish an annual list of the banks and participating lending institutions that have made such loans guaranteed by the SBA during the preceding year. (Sec. 1207) Directs the Associate Administrator to establish a three-year pilot State Trade and Export Promotion Grant Program to make grants to states to carry out export promotion programs for small businesses, including those owned and controlled by women and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-2013. (Sec. 1208) Requires the SBA Administrator to report to Congress on rural export promotion programs for small businesses. (Sec. 1209) Requires a small business development center that counsels a small business concern on international trade issues to: (1) consult with state trade agencies and Export Assistance Centers to provide appropriate services to the small business concern; and (2) refer the small business concern to a state trade agency or an Export Assistance Center, as necessary, for further counseling or assistance.
