Gives priority to LEAs that serve the most high-need schools and those that serve schools with the highest percentages of minorities in their student bodies. Requires the Secretary to evaluate the success of the grantees and compile a database of best practices for recruiting, training, and retaining individuals from underrepresented groups as public elementary and secondary school teachers."
