SAMHSA Modernization Act of 2010 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Expands the activities of SAMHSA to include: (1) the provision of grants to integrate mental health and substance use disorder services into primary care settings; (2) the provision of grants for projects that address the mental health needs of older adults; and (3) programs to recruit and retain qualified mental health and substance use professionals. Revises and reauthorizes appropriations for the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Administrator of SAMHSA, to study whether the funds under the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant and the community mental health services block grant are being distributed to states and territories according to need and to recommend changes in such distribution, if necessary. Establishes the Task Force on Behavioral and Mental Health in Medical Education to develop a plan to strengthen the capacity of graduates of accredited schools of allopathic or osteopathic medicine to deliver integrated, comprehensive health care. Requires such plan to identify specific behavioral and mental health education that should be required for graduation from such schools. Establishes the Council on Integration of Health Care Education to develop recommendations to strengthen the capacity of health care professionals and behavioral health providers to deliver integrated, comprehensive health care. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for the implementation of such recommendations.</summary>
