    "text": "Small Business Export Support Act of 2010 - Amends the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 to require the Secretary of Commerce to assign export licensing compliance specialists to at least 20 United States and Foreign Commercial Service district offices to provide small and medium-sized businesses with support, training, education, and compliance assistance regarding export licensing, including arms export licensing, requirements. Directs the Secretary to review and report to the President annually on the level of staffing at each such district office in order to determine the level that will enable it to serve such businesses effectively. Requires each of the Secretaries of Commerce, of Defense (DOD), of State, and of the Treasury, as well as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), to designate an export licensing coordinator who exercises significant decisionmaking authority in the respective department or agency. Requires the coordinator to devise, encourage, and coordinate department or agency activities providing small and medium-sized businesses with export licensing assistance under this Act. Establishes in the Department of Commerce an Interagency Task Force on Export Control Assistance and Relief for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses to report annually to Congress its recommendations for improving such assistance."
