    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Army to seek to enter into: (1) a contract with Pearson Engineering Limited of Newcastle, the United Kingdom, for the purchase or unlimited lease of the self-protective adaptive roller kit II system (SPARK) technical data package; and (2) contracts with any domestic manufacturer with the capacity to produce such system. (SPARK systems are mounted on tactical vehicles and used to defeat mines.) Provides that if no contract is entered into: (1) with a domestic manufacturer within 30 days after entering into the Pearson contract, the Secretary shall terminate the Pearson contract; and (2) with either Pearson or a domestic manufacturer within 30 days, the Secretary shall coordinate with the Secretary of the Navy to procure the Panama City Generation Three roller system. Directs the Secretary of the Army to enter into such contracts utilizing the rapid acquisition authority for urgently needed systems authorized under the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to waive such contract requirements if such Secretary: (1) determines that entering into such contracts will result in unnecessary combat casualties; and (2) notifies the congressional defense and appropriations committees of such determination, including the reasons supporting such determination."
