Authorizes the use of grant funds to: (1) produce and develop television, radio, Internet, and print advertisements and educational materials; (2) provide for community outreach to motivate community involvement in methamphetamine education; (3) produce a benchmark survey and periodic studies of attitudes and behaviors related to methamphetamine; and (4) conduct qualitative research to assist in the development and testing of the messaging of a methamphetamine prevention campaign and the effectiveness of methamphetamine education. Requires the Attorney General to give priority in making grants to eligible entities that: (1) are addressing widespread methamphetamine use or an emerging threat of such use; (2) have dedicated personnel to oversee a methamphetamine prevention campaign; and (3) demonstrate an ability to provide quality-tested television and print copy for advertising and educational purposes."
