    "text": "Digital Coast Act of 2010 - Defines \"digital coast\" as a constituent-driven platform provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to integrate geospatial data and address coastal and emergency management issues. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of Coastal Services Center of the NOAA, to establish coastal service centers to address the needs of local, state, and regional entities involved with coastal and ocean decisionmaking. Declares that such centers shall: (1) link people, information, and technology to support the environmental, social, and economic well-being of the coast; (2) collaborate with branches of NOAA and other federal and nongovernmental entities to bring data, information, services, and tools to coastal and ocean decisionmakers; and (3) address region-specific needs at local, state, and regional levels. Authorizes the Secretary to enter financial agreements to carry out this Act. Requires such projects to collect and integrate coastal data with specified data sources, surveys, and mappings. Requires the Secretary to coordinate activities with NOAA, state and local governments, the private sector, and federal efforts."
