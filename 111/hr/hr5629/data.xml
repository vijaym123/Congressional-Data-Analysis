  <summary>7/27/2010--Reported to House amended, Part I.
Oil Spill Accountability and Environmental Protection Act of 2010 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) to repeal the limitation on the liability of the responsible party for an offshore facility for damages and removal costs that result from a discharge of oil into or upon the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines or the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Requires the President to review every three years the limits on liability of the responsible party for vessels and onshore facilities and deepwater ports and raise such limits to reflect the greater of: (1) the amount of liability that is commensurate with the risk of discharge of oil presented by a particular category of vessel; or (2) any increase in the Consumer Price Index. Applies such requirements to all claims arising from events or activities occurring on or after April 19, 2010. (Sec. 3) Increases the minimum amount of financial responsibility required for offshore facilities to $1.5 billion. Authorizes the President to require an amount of financial responsibility greater than the minimum amount if the President determines that a larger amount is justified based on the relative operational, environmental, human health, and other risks posed by the quantity, quality, or location of oil that is explored for, drilled for, produced by, or transported by the responsible party. Requires the President to review the level of financial responsibility at least every three years. Authorizes the President to revise such levels upwards based on such risks. Applies such requirements to any lease for exploration, development, or production of minerals that the Secretary of the Interior awards after this Act's enactment. Requires the President to direct any person who, on the date of this Act's enactment, holds a lease for exploration, development, or production of minerals located in navigable waters, adjoining shoreline, or the EEZ to provide evidence of financial responsibility within six months of this Act's enactment. (Sec. 4) Makes responsible parties for vessels or facilities from which oil is discharged liable for damages to human health, including fatal injuries. Applies such requirement to all claims arising from events or activities occurring on or after April 19, 2010, including such claims pending on or before this Act's enactment. (Sec. 5) Treats a mobile offshore drilling unit as an offshore facility for the purposes of calculating excess liability for removal costs and damages from any discharge of oil into or upon the water. Applies such requirement to all claims arising from events or activities occurring on or after April 19, 2010. (Sec. 6) Provides that any determination or assessment of damages to natural resources for the purposes of OPA made by a federal, state, or Indian trustee is subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the President to require a responsible party to provide information about claims in the event of a spill of national significance. Applies such requirement to all claims arising from events or activities occurring on or after April 19, 2010. (Sec. 8) Repeals provisions of the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 that limit the liability of the owner of a vessel from claims, debt, or liability to the value of the vessel and pending freight. (Sec. 9) Amends the Death on the High Seas Act to allow: (1) a civil action in law to benefit a decedent's survivors for the death of an individual that is caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high seas beyond three nautical miles from the U.S. shore; and (2) recovery for fair compensation for the pecuniary and nonpecuniary loss (currently pecuniary) plus a fair compensation for the decedent's pain and suffering. Applies such requirement to all claims arising from events or activities occurring on or after April 19, 2010. (Sec. 10) Amends the Jones Act to authorize a decedent's survivors to recover fair compensation for nonpecuniary losses and the decedent's pain and suffering. Applies such requirement to all claims arising from events or activities occurring on or after April 19, 2010. (Sec. 11) Limits the exploration, development, or production of resources in, on, above, or below the EEZ to vessels owned by U.S. citizens. Applies such requirement to exploration, development, production, and support activities that commence on or after July 1, 2011. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to establish a program to provide Coast Guard personnel with the training necessary for the implementation of this Act. (Sec. 12) Sets forth provisions concerning safety management systems. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to: (1) develop standards to address a worst-case event involving a discharge from mobile offshore drilling units; and (2) designate positions to be in the Coast Guard's marine safety workforce to perform vessel and marine casualty investigations. Sets forth requirements concerning qualifications of the marine safety workforce. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to review and report to Congress on the needs of maritime safety and security teams participating in patrols and setup of safety zones for, and management of, the discharge of oil that began in 2010 in connection with the explosion on, and sinking of, the mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon. Authorizes appropriations to such Secretary to support the response of the Coast Guard and any Coast Guard maritime safety and security team in such patrols, setup of safety zones, and management. (Sec. 17) Revises tank vessel construction standards to repeal specified exemptions to a requirement that vessels be equipped with a double hull. Makes such revision take effect on January 1, 2011. (Sec. 18) Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to revoke the President's authorization to allow tank vessels and facilities to operate without a plan to respond to the discharge of oil or hazardous substances. Prohibits a mobile offshore drilling unit from operating without an approved response plan. (Sec. 19) Requires the National Contingency Plan to include guidelines regarding the use of containment booms for containing a discharge of oil or a hazardous substance. Requires the President, acting through the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to issue a revised regulation for the development of the schedule for the use of dispersants, other chemicals, and other spill mitigating devices and substances.
