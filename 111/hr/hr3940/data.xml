  <summary>9/30/2010--Public Law.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Interior may provide technical assistance to the government of Guam for public education regarding political status options only if those options are consistent with the U.S. Constitution. Amends the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 to deny: (1) the Northern Mariana Islands the 2011 increase in its minimum wage; and (2) American Samoa the 2010 and 2011 increase in its minimum wage. Directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to assess the impact of the minimum wage increases for the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa and report its findings to Congress by September 1, 2011. Requires the GAO to submit subsequent reports by April 1, 2013, and every two years thereafter until both territory's minimum wage meets the federal minimum wage.</summary>
