Community Recovery and Enhancement Act of 2010 or the CRE Act of 2010 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a new tax deduction for 50% of equity investment in a partnership (qualified debt reduction equity investment) and 50% of any payment on commercial real property (qualified debt reduction payment) made to reduce the principal amount of the qualified indebtedness of such partnership or commercial property. Defines "qualified indebtedness" to mean any indebtedness incurred or assumed by a partnership or other taxpayer before January 1, 2009, which is secured by commercial real property. Requires a recapture in income of any deduction taken by a partnership if such partnership incurs additional indebtedness within three years after receiving a qualified debt reduction equity investment under this Act.</summary>
