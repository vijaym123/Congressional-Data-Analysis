National Guard Border Enforcement Act - Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) (Secretary) to deploy at least an additional 10,000 members of the National Guard for border control activities along the U.S.-Mexico border until the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) certifies that the federal government has achieved operational control of the border. Authorizes the Secretary to exceed 10,000 upon the request of a state that shares a portion of the U.S.-Mexico border if, despite deployment of the additional 10,000, operational control of the border has not been achieved. Requires the Secretary to provide funding to a state that submits to the Secretary of State a state border control activities plan meeting certain requirements. Limits the number of National Guard that may be so deployed.</summary>
