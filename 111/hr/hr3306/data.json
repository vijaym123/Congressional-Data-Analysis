Amends SSA title XI to provide for the imposition of civil monetary penalties for specified offenses involving SSNs or Social Security cards. Establishes: (1) new criminal penalties upon Social Security Administration employees who knowingly and fraudulently issue Social Security cards or SSNs; and (2) enhanced penalties in cases of terrorism, drug trafficking, crimes of violence, or prior offenses. Amends SSA title XI with respect to regulatory and enforcement authority with respect to misuse of SSNs. Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to enter into an arrangement with the National Research Council to study and report to the Commissioner and Congress on: (1) the extent of the use of SSNs as a primary means of authenticating identity or for verification in commercial transactions; and (2) the feasibility of a prohibition on such use. Requires the study also to examine possible alternatives to SSNs for such uses."
