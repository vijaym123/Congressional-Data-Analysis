    "text": "Protecting Jobs in Your State Act of 2010 - Prohibits a state or a political subdivision from using funds made available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, Public Law 111-226 (relating to education jobs and Medicaid payments to states), the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, or the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, or funds for disaster relief administered by the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), as an incentive for a business to: (1) relocate a plant, facility, or other operation from one state to another; or (2) expand an operation in a state in a manner that will result in a reduction in such an operation in another state. Authorizes a political subdivision to submit to the state governor a petition stating that it has been adversely affected by a violation of such prohibition and requesting that the governor submit to the Secretary of Commerce a petition for an investigation. Provides that if the Secretary determines that a violation has occurred, the state in which such a violation was committed shall be liable to the United States for the amount of funds involved. Prohibits such a state from receiving any other funds under such Acts until it fully repays such amount to the United States. Directs the Comptroller General, biannually during the period that ends five years after this Act's enactment, to submit to specified committees a report on the impact of such provisions, including: (1) a statement of the number of petitions received by the Secretary of Commerce and a summary of the disposition of such petitions; (2) a list of U.S. claims that arose, were outstanding, or were collected; and (3) a list of any funds withheld."
