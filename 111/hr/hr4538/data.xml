  <summary>1/27/2010--Introduced.
Fair Access to Credit Scores Act of 2010 - Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require consumer reporting agencies to disclose any information in the consumer's file concerning credit scores or other related risk scores or predictors when the consumer requests a free annual disclosure (credit report). Requires all consumer reporting agencies to maintain information in the consumer's file concerning such scores or predictors for at least one year from the date on which such information is placed in the file. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on bankruptcy risk scores used by consumer reporting agencies, including an analysis of: (1) the factors used to determine such scores; (2) how bankruptcy risk scores impact the ability of consumers to receive loans; and (3) actions that consumers can take to improve such scores.</summary>
