  <summary>3/25/2010--Introduced.
Amends federal patent law to revise the authorization of civil suits to collect one-half of the $500 penalty for false marking. Limits the right to file a civil action in a U.S. district court to persons who have suffered a competitive injury as a result of a violation of the prohibition against false marking. (Thus repeals the right of any person to sue for the penalty.) Allows a person who has suffered a competitive injury to file a civil action to recover damages adequate to compensate for the injury. (Current law allows any person to collect up to one-half of $500 for every such offense.)</summary>
