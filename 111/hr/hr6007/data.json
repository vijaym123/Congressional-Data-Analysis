Urges the USTR, before initiating an investigation, to seek consultations with each foreign country identified as engaging in priority foreign country trade practices in order to reach a satisfactory resolution of such practices. Requires the USTR to initiate an investigation only if a satisfactory resolution has not been reached within 90 days after a report on the practices to the appropriate congressional committees."
