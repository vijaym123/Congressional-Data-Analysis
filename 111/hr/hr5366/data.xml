Overseas Contractor Reform Act - Requires any person found to be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 to be proposed for debarment from any federal contract or grant within 30 days after final judgment of such violation. Authorizes the head of a federal agency to waive this provision for a federal contract or grant and to report such waiver to Congress within 30 days with a justification. Declares that it is U.S. government policy that no government contracts or grants should be awarded to individuals or companies who violate that Act.</summary>
