Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2009 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the government of Saudi Arabia: (1) cooperate fully with the United States in the investigation of terror groups and individuals; (2) close permanently all organizations in Saudi Arabia that fund, train, encourage, or in any way aid terrorism anywhere in the world, and end funding for such organizations outside Saudi Arabia; and (3) block funding from private Saudi citizens and entities to Saudi-based or offshore terror organizations. Directs the President to prohibit certain exports to Saudi Arabia and restrict travel of certain Saudi diplomats if the President cannot certify to the appropriate congressional committees that the government of Saudi Arabia: (1) is fully cooperating with the United States in investigating and preventing terrorist attacks; (2) has closed permanently all Saudi-based terror organizations; (3) has ended funding for any offshore terror organization; and (4) has exercised maximum efforts to block funding from private Saudi citizens and entities to offshore terror organizations. Allows the President to waive such sanctions for national security reasons. Prohibits visa issuance to citizens of Saudi Arabia until the President certifies that Saudi Arabia does not discriminate in visa issuance based upon religion or heritage.</summary>
