  <summary>6/25/2009--Introduced.
Save Our Industries Act of 2009 or the SAVE Act - Grants duty-free treatment, subject to specified conditions, to certain apparel wholly assembled in the United States or the Philippines, or both, and components of such apparel consisting entirely of: (1) fabric components cut in the United States or the Philippines, or both, from fabric wholly formed in the United States from yarns wholly formed in the United States; (2) components knit-to-shape in the United States from yarns wholly formed in the United States; or (3) any combination of such components. Grants: (1) a reduction of duty for such apparel, provided the same criteria are met; and (2) duty-free treatment to apparel that meet both the requirements for duty-free treatment and reduction of duty. Requires the Comptroller General to evaluate the effectiveness of the preferential duty treatment afforded under this Act to apparel imported from the Philippines. Prohibits preferential duty treatment of apparel imported from the Philippines unless the President certifies to Congress that it is meeting certain trade enforcement conditions with respect to such apparel. Terminates preferential duty treatment under this Act: (1) 10 years after the effective date of this Act; and (2) when the Philippines becomes ineligible for designation as a beneficiary country under the Generalized System of Preferences.</summary>
