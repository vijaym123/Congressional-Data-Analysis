Prohibits construing this Act to: (1) affect the authority of the USPS regarding requirements concerning the design, placement, and limitation on costs relating to commemorative plaques, so long as the requirements are applied uniformly; or (2) limit, supersede, or render inapplicable any other authority or duty of the USPS regarding the commemorative designation of a facility or the funding, commissioning, or installation of a plaque in connection with such a designation."
