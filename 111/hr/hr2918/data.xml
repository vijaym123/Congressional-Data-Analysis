Division A: Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2010 - Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2010 - Title I: Legislative Branch - Makes appropriations to the Senate for FY2010 for: (1) a payment to Victoria Reggie Kennedy, widow of Edward M. Kennedy, late a Senator from Massachusetts; (2) expense allowances; (3) representation allowances for the Majority and Minority Leaders; (4) salaries of specified officers, employees, and committees (including the Committee on Appropriations); (5) agency contributions for employee benefits; (6) inquiries and investigations; (7) the U.S. Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control; (8) the Offices of the Secretary and of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate; (9) miscellaneous items; (10) the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account; and (11) official mail costs. (Sec. 1) Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriation Act, 1968 to increase by $50,000 the aggregate of gross compensation paid all employees in the office of a Senator, according to a specified table. (Sec. 2) Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1965 to make it discretionary instead of, as under current law, mandatory that reports of semiannual statements of expenditures by the Secretary of the Senate and by the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives be printed as Senate and House documents, respectively. Requires the Secretary, beginning with the report covering the first full semiannual period of the 112th Congress, to: (1) post each semiannual report of the Secretary of the Senate publicly on the Senate's website in a searchable, itemized format; and (2) issue each such report in electronic form. Authorizes the Secretary to issue each such report in other forms at his discretion.
