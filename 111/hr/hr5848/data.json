Revises the minimum state allotment for such program to be the greater of the amount received by the state in FY2009 or $750,000. (Current law sets forth a minimum allotment of $300,000 per state.) Provides that if funds appropriated are insufficient for all states to receive the minimum allotment, then states shall receive no less than the amount they received in FY2009 with additional money spent to give states the minimum of $750,000."
