  <summary>1/28/2009--Introduced.
Prohibits any federal department, agency, or court from taking any action (administrative, civil, criminal, or otherwise) that would prohibit, interfere with, regulate, or otherwise restrict the interstate traffic of milk, or a milk product, that is unpasteurized and packaged for direct human consumption, solely on the basis that the milk or milk product is unpasteurized and is therefore adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise in violation of federal law.</summary>
