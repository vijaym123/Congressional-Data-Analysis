Prohibits the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from using federally funded clinical comparative effectiveness research data to make coverage determinations under Medicare for medical treatments, services, and items on the basis of cost. Provides for expedited appeals of Medicare coverage determinations using federally funded comparative effectiveness research. Denies federal funding for clinical comparative effectiveness research that does not consider racial, ethnic, gender, and geographic differences within patient subpopulations."
