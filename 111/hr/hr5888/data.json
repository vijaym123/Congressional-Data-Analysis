Makes eligible only those residents that are not covered under any public or private program that provides substantial benefits towards the purchase of outpatient prescription drugs. Requires rebates to be payable to the Secretary at least quarterly and to be paid, directly or through states, to participating pharmacies that provide discounts to qualified residents. Denies manufacturers who do not participate in the rebate program a tax deduction for advertising and marketing expenses of drugs."
