  <summary>4/22/2009--Introduced.
Ambulatory Surgical Center Access Act of 2009 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to revise the requirements and the formula for payments for services, including an implantable medical device, furnished to individuals in ambulatory surgical centers. Revises requirements for the reporting of data by ambulatory surgical centers and hospital outpatient departments. Directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to study and report to Congress on outpatient surgical services. Requires the expert outside advisory panel the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to consult with respect to the clinical integrity of the groups and payment weights to include at least one ambulatory surgical center representative. States that the conditions for coverage of ambulatory surgical center services specified by the Secretary shall not prohibit ambulatory surgical centers from providing individuals with any notice of rights or other required notice on the date of a procedure if more advanced notice is not feasible under the circumstances, including when a procedure is scheduled and performed on the same day.</summary>
