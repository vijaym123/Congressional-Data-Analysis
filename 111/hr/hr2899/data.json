Requires eligible projects on such lands to be carried out in a cost-effective manner that focuses on surface, ladder, and canopy fuels reduction activities or implements forest restoration activities in response to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Requires the Secretaries to: (1) prepare an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for each proposed eligible project; and (2) evaluate and consider an alternative recommendation if a project is or may be inconsistent with its community wildfire protection plan. Requires administrative and judicial review of eligible projects in accordance with the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003."
