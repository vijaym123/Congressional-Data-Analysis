Mitochondrial Medicine Research and Treatment Enhancement Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish within the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) an Office of Mitochondrial Medicine (OMM). Requires the OMM Director to develop, make publicly available, implement, and biennially update a written plan to facilitate research into mitochondrial medicine. Sets forth as plan objectives: (1) improving coordination of research related to mitochondrial medicine among the national research institutes and between NIH and outside researchers; (2) providing training to research scientists and health professionals engaged in research related to mitochondrial medicine; (3) providing training to health care providers regarding the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease and dysfunction; and (4) establishing scientific review groups with expertise in mitochondrial medicine to oversee relevant research projects in NIH. Requires the OMM Director to award at least five grants, annually, for each of the following: (1) integrated, multi-project research programs related to mitochondrial medicine; and (2) planning activities associated with such programs. Authorizes the Director to award grants to institutions or consortiums of institutions to establish Mitochondrial Medicine Centers of Excellence to promote interdisciplinary research and training related to mitochondrial medicine. Requires the Director to establish: (1) a national registry for the maintenance and sharing for research purposes of medical information collected from patients with mitochondrial disease or dysfunction; and (2) a national biorepository for the maintenance and sharing for research purposes of tissues and DNA collected from such patients.</summary>
