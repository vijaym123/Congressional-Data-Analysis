  <summary>7/30/2010--Introduced.
Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to authorize enforcement through a civil suit of the prohibition against the diversion or export of Great Lakes water by a state, federal agency, or private entity for use outside the Great Lakes basin unless such diversion or export is approved by the governor of each of the Great Lakes states. Allows such a civil suit to be filed by the federal government, a state or local government, or by any person or organization whose property or other legally recognized interest will be adversely affected. Makes the proper venue for such a civil suit the federal judicial district with jurisdiction over any portion of the Great Lakes Basin and from which the diversion or export of water will occur or has occurred.</summary>
