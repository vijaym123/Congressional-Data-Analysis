Allows such a civil suit to be filed by the federal government, a state or local government, or by any person or organization whose property or other legally recognized interest will be adversely affected. Makes the proper venue for such a civil suit the federal judicial district with jurisdiction over any portion of the Great Lakes Basin and from which the diversion or export of water will occur or has occurred."
