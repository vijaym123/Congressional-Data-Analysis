Includes energy-related and rare disease-related research topics as deserving special consideration under Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program research topics. Includes nanotechnology-related topics within authorized research topics under the SBIR Program and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program. Requires each federal agency that is required to have an SBIR program and that awards annually $5 billion or more in procurement contracts to establish, for FY2010 and thereafter, annual goals for the commercialization of projects funded by SBIR awards. Directs each federal agency required to conduct an SBIR program to establish a commercialization program that supports the progress of SBIR awardees to the third (final) phase. Provides funding for such commercialization programs."
