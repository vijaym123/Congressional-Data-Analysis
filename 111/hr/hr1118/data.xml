  <summary>2/23/2009--Introduced.
Health Care Choices for Seniors Act - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivor's and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a procedure under which an individual otherwise entitled to benefits under part A (Hospital Insurance) of SSA title XVIII (Medicare) may waive such entitlement and be automatically enrolled in the Medicare Alternative Voucher Program (MAV Program). Directs the Secretary to establish the MAV Program, under which a voucher may be used as a contribution into a health savings account and for the payment of enrollment premiums under a high deductible health plan. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the amount of the itemized deduction for health savings accounts by the amount of the MAV that is contributed to an individual's health savings account. Suspends Medicare late enrollment penalties for an individual between ages 65 and 70.</summary>
