Makes a first responder not entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity nevertheless immune from civil liability under federal, state, and local law if such responder acted in good faith and on objectively reasonable suspicion. Entitles a first responder found to be immune from liability under this Act to recover from the plaintiff all reasonable costs and attorney fees."
