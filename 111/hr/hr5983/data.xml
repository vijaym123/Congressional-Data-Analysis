  <summary>7/30/2010--Introduced.
Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 2010 - Establishes as an independent federal entity the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or People With Other Significant Disabilities. (Effectively replacing the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.) Requires the Committee to establish and publish in the Federal Register a list of products and services suitable for federal government procurement which are provided by qualified nonprofit agencies for people who are blind or for people with other significant disabilities. Requires federal agencies to procure from such qualified nonprofit agencies, at a Committee-established price, products (except prison-made products) or services essentially the same as those on the procurement list. Requires the Committee to designate a tax-exempt central nonprofit agency or agencies for people who are blind and one or more for people with other significant disabilities, which shall evaluate their respective nonprofit agencies and recommend suitable products or services to add to the procurement list. Authorizes the Committee to conduct pilot or demonstration projects on methods to increase the use of: (1) such products or services by the federal government; as well as (2) people who are blind and people with other significant disabilities. Amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to require the Committee Chairman to: (1) appoint an Inspector General for the Committee; and (2) establish a Panel on the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or People With Other Significant Disabilities. Establishes in the general fund of the Treasury in a separate account a Committee for Purchase Fund for the collection and deposit of fees from each central nonprofit agency. Repeals the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act.</summary>
