Authorizes the FBI Director to disclose information received from the Secretary to federal, state, and local law enforcement officials, but restricts the use of such information to carrying out criminal investigations or prosecutions. Requires employers who have been notified of suspected misuse of an employee's social security account number to cease including such account number on statements provided to such employee."
