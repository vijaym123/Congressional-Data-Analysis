  <summary>5/11/2010--Introduced.
Earmark Transparency Act of 2010 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate to establish jointly a free public searchable website, listing all requests by Members of Congress for congressionally directed spending items (congressional earmarks). Requires each congressional committee, within five calendar days of receipt of a request for a congressional earmark from a Member of Congress, to provide to the Clerk and the Secretary, as applicable, the initial required information regarding that request that is required to be placed on the website. Makes it out of order to consider any legislation unless it meets the requirements of this Act.</summary>
