Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, to carry out the operation, maintenance, and repair of the Dam, to authorize employees of the Department of the Interior and the District to use certain roads under Forest Service jurisdiction. Prohibits requiring any such individual from applying for or possessing a permit, license, or other similar document as a condition for authorization to use any such road. Requires the Department and the District to comply with applicable federal law."
