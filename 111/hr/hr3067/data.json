Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a national public information campaign on initial preventive physical examinations for Medicare beneficiaries. Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) with respect to rules governing enhanced marketplace pools for small business health plans. Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to add a new title XXXI (Health Care Insurance Marketplace Modernization) under which the Secretary shall promulgate regulations establishing minimum standards for health insurance premium variations and model small group rating rules. Provides for affordable plans and the harmonization of health insurance standards. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax deduction for the qualified health insurance costs of individuals. Amends veterans benefits law to allow an enrolled veteran to elect to receive covered health services through a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility. Authorizes VA pharmacies to dispense medications to veterans on private practitioner prescriptions. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a program of child care assistance for individuals pursuing advanced nursing degrees. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary to award grants to partnerships of accredited nursing schools and hospitals or health facilities to establish projects to enable a hospital or health facility to retain its staff of experienced nurses while having these individuals become, through an accelerated nursing education program, faculty members of an accredited nursing school. Amends PHSA to authorize the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to enter into an agreement for the repayment of education loans with any U.S. citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident who: (1) holds an unencumbered license as a registered nurse; and (2) has either already completed a master's or doctorate nursing program at an accredited school of nursing or is currently enrolled on a full-time or part-time basis in such a program. Requires each such agreement to require the eligible individual to serve as a full-time member of the faculty of an accredited school of nursing for a minimum four-year period. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to carry out programs to increase the number of nurses within the armed forces. Prescribes requirements for determination of the effective date of active duty for members of a reserve component of the armed forces."
