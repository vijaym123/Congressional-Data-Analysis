  <summary>4/2/2009--Introduced.
Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2009 or the STANDUP Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to award incentive grants to states with graduated driver licensing laws that include, for novice drivers under age 21, a two-stage licensing process before the grant of an unrestricted driver's license. Requires such laws, at a minimum, to include: (1) a learner's permit stage that commences at age 16 or older, lasts at least six months, prohibits the use of a cellular phone or other communications device in non-emergency situations, prohibits nighttime driving, and is in effect until commencement of the intermediate stage or when the driver attains age 18 or older; (2) an intermediate stage in effect until the driver attains age 18 or older that commences after expiration of the learner's permit stage, lasts at least six months, prohibits more than one non-familial passenger under age of 21 if there is no licensed driver age 21 or older present in the vehicle, prohibits nighttime driving, and prohibits the use of a cellular phone or other communications device in non-emergency situations; and (3) any other requirement that the Secretary may require. Directs the Secretary to withhold a certain percentage of federal-aid highway funds from states that do not comply with the requirements of this Act.</summary>
