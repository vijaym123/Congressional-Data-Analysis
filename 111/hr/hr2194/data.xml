Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 - (Sec. 3) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) international diplomatic efforts to address Iran's illicit nuclear efforts and support for international terrorism are more likely to be effective if strong additional sanctions are imposed on the government of Iran; (2) U.S. concerns regarding Iran are strictly the result of that government&#146;s actions; (3) the September 2009 revelation that Iran is developing a secret uranium enrichment site near Qom highlights the urgency that Iran disclose the full nature of its nuclear program and provide the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) unfettered access to its facilities; (4) because of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) involvement in Iran's nuclear program, international terrorism, and domestic human rights abuses the President should impose the full range of sanctions on individuals or entities with IRGC ties; (5) the United States should adopt additional measures to prevent the diversion of sensitive dual-use technologies to Iran; (6) the President should take measures to respond to violations of human rights and religious freedom in Iran; (7) it is in the U.S. national interest to allow responsible U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations to establish and carry out operations in Iran to promote civil society and foster goodwill among the people of Iran; (8) the United States should not issue a license for the export of nuclear materials, services, or technology to a country that is providing similar materials, services, or technology to another country that is not in full compliance with its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) unless their provision does not undermine U.S. nonproliferation policies; and (9) the people of the United States have feelings of friendship for the people of Iran and regret that developments in recent decades have created impediments to that friendship. Title I: Sanctions - (Sec. 102) Amends the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (ISA) to direct the President to impose three or more specified ISA sanctions if a person (defined by such Act to include a natural person, business enterprise, or government entity operating as a business enterprise) has knowingly made an investment of $20 million or more, or any combination of investments of at least $5 million which in the aggregate equals or exceeds $20 million in any 12-month period, that directly and significantly contributed to Iran's ability to develop petroleum resources. (Under current law the sanction thresholds are $40 million, $10 million, and $40 million, respectively.) Directs the President to impose three or more specified ISA sanctions on a person that knowingly sells, leases, or provides goods, services, technology, information, or provides support related to the production of refined petroleum products in Iran: (1) any of which has a fair market value of $1 million or more; or (2) that during a 12-month period have an aggregate fair market value of $5 million or more. Directs the President to impose three or more specified ISA sanctions on a person that knowingly: (1) provides Iran with refined petroleum products that have a fair market value of $1 million or more, or that, during a 12-month period, have an aggregate fair market value of $5 million or more; or (2) sells, leases, or provides to Iran certain goods, services, technology, information, or support any of which has a fair market value of $1 million or more, or that during a 12-month period have an aggregate fair market value of $5 million or more.

Defines "refined petroleum products" to mean diesel, gasoline, jet fuel (including naphtha-type and kerosene-type jet fuel), and aviation gasoline. Authorizes the President to waive sanctions for up to 12 months (with additional 12-month renewals) on a case-by-case basis for a person if: (1) such person is under the jurisdiction of a government that is cooperating with the United States in multilateral efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring or developing chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons or related technologies, including ballistic delivery systems, or acquiring or developing destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons; and (2) such waiver is vital to U.S. security interests. Requires a report to Congress identifying any such person. Eliminates the enhanced sanction provision. Requires the President to immediately investigate a person upon receipt of credible information that such person is engaged in sanctionable activity. (Current law provides that the President should initiate such investigation.) States that the President need not initiate, and may terminate, an investigation if the person has ended such activities. States that the provisions of this section shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act, and, with specified exceptions, apply to investments and activities begun on or after such date. Sets forth applicability provisions regarding specified sanctionable activities.

(Sec. 202) Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should support a state or local government decision to divest from or prohibit the investment of its assets in a person that engages in investment activities in Iran's energy sector as long as Iran is subject to U.S. economic sanctions.

(Sec. 205) Amends the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007 regarding divestment standards. Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended by section 203 of this Act, to state that nothing in such amendment shall be construed to create or affect any private right of action that exists or does not exist under such Act. Title III: Prevention of Diversion of Certain Goods, Services, and Technologies to Iran - (Sec. 302) Requires the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to report to the President, Secretaries of Defense, Commerce, State, Treasury, and to Congress identifying countries which allow the diversion through the country of certain goods, services, or technologies to Iranian end-users or Iranian intermediaries. Describes such goods, services, or technologies as those that: (1) originated in the United States and would make a material contribution to Iran's development of nuclear, chemical, biological, ballistic, or advanced conventional weapons, or support for international terrorism, and are on the Commerce Control List or the United States Munitions List; or (2) are prohibited for export to Iran by the Security Council. (Sec. 303) Directs the President to designate a country as a Destination of Possible Diversion Concern if the country's government allows substantial diversion of prohibited goods, services, or technologies through the country to Iranian end-users or Iranian intermediaries. Bases such designation on criteria that include: (1) the volume of goods, services, or technologies that are transported through the country to Iranian end-users or intermediaries; (2) the inadequacy of the country's export controls; and (3) the country's unwillingness or inability to control diversion activities or cooperate with the United States in interdiction efforts. Directs the President, upon such designation, to: (1) report to Congress; and (2) require an export license for the export of U.S. goods, services, or technologies that, if diverted to Iran, would contribute to Iran's weapons programs, defense capabilities, or support of terrorism (with a presumption of denial for all such license applications). Authorizes the President to delay such licensing requirement for 12 months, with additional 12-month delays, if a country is taking specified actions to stop diversions to Iran. Provides that upon a presidential determination that is it appropriate to carry out government-to-government activities to strengthen a country's export control system the United States shall initiate activities to: (1) develop or strengthen the country's export control system; (2) train the appropriate officials; and (3) encourage Proliferation Security Initiative participation. Terminates a country's designation as a Destination of Diversion Concern when the President certifies to Congress that the country has strengthened its export control system to prevent such Iranian diversions. (Sec. 304) Directs the President to report to Congress on whether to extend the measures in this title to countries that allow diversion to countries other than Iran seeking weapons of mass destruction or supporting international terrorism. (Sec. 305) Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to designate an employee of the Office of Export Enforcement to conduct certain enforcement activities under the Export Administration Act of 1979 pursuant to: (1) such Act or any license, order, or regulation issued under such Act; and (2) this title and any other export control provision under the Secretary's responsibility. Title IV: General Provisions - (Sec. 401) Terminates the provisions of this Act 30 days after the date on which the President certifies to Congress that: (1) the government of Iran has ceased supporting acts of international terrorism and no longer satisfies certain requirements for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism; and (2) Iran has ceased the pursuit, acquisition, and development of nuclear, biological, chemical, and ballistic weapons. Authorizes the President to waive, if in the U.S. national interest: (1) the application of sanctions; (2) sanctions on Iranian officials complicit in human rights abuses; (3) the prohibition on procurement contracts with persons that export sensitive technology to Iran; or (4) the imposition of the licensing requirement for a country designated as a Destination of Diversion Concern. Directs the President to report to Congress regarding any such waiver. Authorizes appropriations to: (1) the Secretary of State and to the Secretary of the Treasury to implement titles I and III; and (2) the Secretary of Commerce to implement title III.
