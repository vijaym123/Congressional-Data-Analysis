    "text": "Gulf Coast Restoration Act - Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to authorize the Secretary of Labor to award national emergency grants to a state to provide oil spill relief employment assistance for an area of the state that has been affected by an oil or hazardous substances spill of national significance (covered incident). Makes assistance available to: (1) provide oil spill relief employment of unemployed or dislocated workers on projects to clean, restore, or reconstruct lands, marshes, waters, and structures located within an area of a covered incident, as well as for food, clothing, shelter and other humanitarian assistance to affected individuals; (2) establish cleanup standards; (3) provide employment and training of, and protective equipment to, workers; (4) increase a state's capacity to provide information about public and private services at one-stop centers and other access points to individuals adversely affected by a covered incident; and (5) provide temporary employment by public sector entities. Requires the Secretary to require states receiving oil spill relief employment assistance to provide assurance that Davis-Bacon Act (locality pay) wages are paid to all employees and contractors who work on such projects. Limits an individual's oil spill employment to six months, subject to extension for a period determined by the Secretary. Establishes a Gulf Coast Community Conservation Corps (Gulf Coast CCC), administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service, to carry out national service programs that provide a covered incident area with oil spill relief specified in this Act. Authorizes the Corporation to transfer funds from the National Service Trust Fund to provide in-service or post-service national service educational benefits to individuals participating in a Gulf Coast CCC national service program. Requires parties responsible for a covered incident to reimburse the federal government for costs incurred in carrying out the activities authorized under this Act."
