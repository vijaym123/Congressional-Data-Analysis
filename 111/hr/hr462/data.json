Amends SSA title XI to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to identify and publish for general comment an initial, recommended core set of child health quality measures for use by state programs administered under Medicaid and SCHIP, health insurance issuers, and managed care entities that enter into contracts with such programs, as well as providers of items and services.
