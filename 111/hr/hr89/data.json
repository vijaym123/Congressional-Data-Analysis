Shields the United States from liability for damages relating to the conveyed property, except those caused by negligent acts by U.S. employees or agents prior to conveyance. Provides that after the conveyance: (1) the System shall not be considered to be part of a federal reclamation project; and (2) the District shall not be eligible to receive any benefits with respect to any facility comprising the Goleta Water Distribution System, except benefits that would be available to a similarly situated entity with respect to property that is not part of a federal reclamation project. Requires: (1) the Secretary to complete all actions required under environmental and historic preservation laws prior to any conveyance; and (2) the District to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws in its operation of the transferred facilities. Provides that federal reclamation law shall continue to apply to project water provided to the District. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress if the conveyance has not been completed within 12 months."
