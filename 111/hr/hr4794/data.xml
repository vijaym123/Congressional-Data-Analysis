  <summary>3/9/2010--Introduced.
Safeguarding Access to Preventative Services Act of 2010 - Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) from using any recommendation of the Preventive Services Task Force to deny or restrict coverage of an item or service under a federal health care program (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program). Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) prohibit a group health plan from using any recommendation of that Task Force to deny or restrict coverage; (2) require the sponsor of a group health plan, in determining which preventive items and services to provide coverage for, to consult the medical guidelines and recommendations of relevant professional medical organizations of relevant practice areas, including those relating to the coverage of women's preventive services; and (3) require the plan administrator to disclose such guidelines and recommendations as part of a summary of benefits and coverage provided to participants. Amends PHSA to apply such requirements to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer in the individual market in the same manner it applies to coverage offered in the group market.</summary>
