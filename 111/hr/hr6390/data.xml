  <summary>9/29/2010--Introduced.
Transparent Baseball Ticket Fees Act - Makes it unlawful for any person to complete a primary sale of a Major League Baseball ticket through an Internet website without clearly and conspicuously disclosing to the consumer: (1) the amount and description of any fees, convenience charges, or other charges associated with such sale or ticket; and (2) the total amount of such fees or charges as a percentage of the total purchase price. Defines "primary sale" as the initial sale of a ticket that has not previously been sold to the general public. Treats such offense as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.</summary>
