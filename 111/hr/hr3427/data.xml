  <summary>9/28/2010--Passed House amended.
State Ethics Law Protection Act of 2010 - Considers a state transportation department not to have violated federal contract requirements for the construction of a federal-aid highway project solely because the state in which such department is located, or a local government within that state, has in effect a law or order that limits the amount of money an individual or entity doing business with a state or local agency with respect to such a project may contribute to a political party, campaign, or elected official (pay to play).</summary>
