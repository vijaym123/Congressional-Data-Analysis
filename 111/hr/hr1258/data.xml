  <summary>4/14/2010--Passed House amended.
Truth in Caller ID Act of 2010 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make it unlawful for any person in the United States, in connection with any real time voice communications, regardless of the technology or network used, to cause any caller identification service to transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification information ("spoofing") with the intent to defraud or deceive. Prohibits construing this Act to prevent blocking caller identification. Declares that this Act does not prohibit lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of a law enforcement agency of the United States, a state, or a political subdivision of a state, or of a U.S. intelligence agency.</summary>
