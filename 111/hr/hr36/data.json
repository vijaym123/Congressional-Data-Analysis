Requires the Archivist of the United States to make such information available to the public through the Internet as soon as is practicable after each quarterly filing. Makes it unlawful for contributors or fundraising organizations to knowingly and willfully submit false information or omit material information. Prescribes criminal penalties for violation of such prohibitions."
