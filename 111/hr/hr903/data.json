Includes dental entities among entities that may carry out education and training activities to improve responses to public health emergencies. Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to: (1) define \"emergency responder providers\" to include federal, state, and local governmental and nongovernmental dental personnel, agencies, and authorities; and (2) require the Chief Medical Officer to serve as the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) primary point of contact for the dental community, with respect to medical and public health matters. Amends the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to require operational plans developed under the National Response Plan to address the preparedness and deployment of dental resources."
