  <summary>6/11/2009--Introduced.
Breastfeeding Promotion Act of 2009 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include lactation (i.e., breastfeeding or the expressing of milk from the breast) as protected conduct under such Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a business-related tax credit for 50% of their qualified breastfeeding promotion and support expenditures, up to $10,000 for any taxable year. Defines "qualified breastfeeding promotion and support expenditures" as business expenses incurred for breast pumps and other equipment specially designed to assist mothers who are breastfeeding their children and for consultation services relating to breastfeeding. Expands the tax deduction for medical expenses to include expenses for breastfeeding equipment and consultation services. Safe and Effective Breast Pumps Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) effect a performance standard for breast pumps without regard to their classification under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and (2) issue a compliance policy guide to provide women with information about breast pumps. Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to require employers with 50 or more employees to provide their breastfeeding employees with break time and private areas to express breast milk for their nursing children.</summary>
