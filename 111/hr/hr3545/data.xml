  <summary>9/9/2009--Introduced.
Full-Service Community Schools Act of 2009 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award grants to: (1) consortia composed of a local educational agency and one or more community-based, nonprofit, or other public or private entities to assist public elementary or secondary schools to function as full-service community schools; and (2) state collaboratives to support the development of full-service community school programs. Requires such schools to: (1) participate in community-based efforts to coordinate educational, developmental, family, health, and other comprehensive services through community-based organizations and public and private partnerships; and (2) provide access to such services to students, families, and the community. Gives local grant priority to consortia that: (1) will serve at least two full-service community schools eligible for schoolwide programs under the Act, and more than one full-service community school as part of a community or districtwide strategy; (2) demonstrate a record of effectiveness in coordinating multiple qualified services; and (3) will be connected to a school and community partnership group that brings together key stakeholders across varied sectors to improve results for students and their families. Establishes a Full-Service Community Schools Advisory Committee.</summary>
