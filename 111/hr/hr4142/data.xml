Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act - Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) submit to Congress, within 90 days after enactment of this Act, a list of all commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies that the Secretary believes are too big to fail (" Too Big To Fail List"); and (2) break up entities included on such list so that their failure would no longer cause a catastrophic effect on the United States or global economy without a taxpayer bailout.</summary>
