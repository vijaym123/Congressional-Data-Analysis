  <summary>6/18/2009--Introduced.
Health Care Professional Pipeline Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make a grant to a qualified youth serving organization to establish and expand emergency preparedness pipelines consisting of: (1) health science curricula in secondary schools, institutions of higher education, and continuing education programs that prepare students for careers as future health care professionals; and (2) school-based emergency preparedness chapters to recruit and prepare students for public health emergencies. Defines a "qualified youth serving organization" as a nonprofit organization that prepares youth exclusively for career entry and advancement opportunities in the health professions, offers a national recognition and competitive events program in which students can demonstrate their knowledge and skills in responding to public health emergencies, and operates at least 2,500 chapters in at least 40 states. Requires the Secretary to make a grant each year to such an organization to conduct a national leadership conference that includes representatives of health science programs, emergency preparedness chapters, and the Medical Reserve Corps.</summary>
