National Home Energy Savings Revolving Fund Act - Establishes within the Department of Energy (DOE) the National Home Energy Savings Revolving Fund to provide funds to local governments for use in making loans to homeowners for the costs of conducting a qualified home energy audit and implementing, acquiring, and installing certified energy savings improvements. Requires the Secretary of Energy to establish procedures and techniques for home energy audits that: (1) establish priorities for selection of energy savings improvements based on their cost-effectiveness, payback period, and contribution to energy savings; (2) measure the energy requirement of individual dwellings and the rate of return of the total energy savings investment in a dwelling; and (3) account for interaction among energy savings measures. Sets forth requirements concerning loan eligibility and repayment. Limits the total loan amount to a single homeowner to $10,000.</summary>
