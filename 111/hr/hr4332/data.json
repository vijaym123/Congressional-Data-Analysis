Requires the holder of such contracts to receive specified compensation for the cancellation. Deems: (1) any negotiated agreement between the Secretary and the contract holder as to the amount of compensation to be a compromise settlement of imminent litigation; and (2) judgment by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to be final. Directs the Secretary to offer for sale by competitive bidding specified lands identified for disposition near Victorville, California, and provides for the acquisition of environmentally sensitive land and interests with the proceeds of such sale."
