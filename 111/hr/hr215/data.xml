  <summary>1/6/2009--Introduced.
Congressional Pay Reform Act of 2009 - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to eliminate automatic pay adjustments for Members of Congress. Requires the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress to be the rate payable as of the enactment of this Act, until such rate is adjusted following recommendations by the President under the Federal Salary Act of 1967 (or under any other law). Requires any bill or resolution, or its amendment, providing for any increase in such payable rate (other than a pay adjustment recommended by the President under the Federal Salary Act of 1967) to be adopted by the House of Representatives or the Senate only by a recorded vote so as to reflect the vote of each Member.</summary>
