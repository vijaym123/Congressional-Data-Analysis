Allows individuals with end stage renal disease (ESRD) to receive Medicare benefits through enrollment in a Medicare+Choice plan. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to specify an annual period during which individuals enrolled in a Medigap policy with a particular benefit package may change to another such policy if the other policy: (1) is offered by a different issuer and is available for issuance to new enrollees; and (2) has the same benefit package or a benefit package with lesser benefits."
