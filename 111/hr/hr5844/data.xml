  <summary>7/22/2010--Introduced.
Fairness in Medigap Options Act of 2010 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to make eligible for guaranteed issue of Medicare supplemental (Medigap) policies: (1) all Medicare beneficiaries; (2) Medicare Advantage plan enrollees who disenroll from the plan and elect to receive benefits through the original Medicare fee-for-service program; and (3) Medicaid (SSA title XIX) plan enrollees who have lost eligibility for such medical assistance. Allows individuals with end stage renal disease (ESRD) to receive Medicare benefits through enrollment in a Medicare+Choice plan. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to specify an annual period during which individuals enrolled in a Medigap policy with a particular benefit package may change to another such policy if the other policy: (1) is offered by a different issuer and is available for issuance to new enrollees; and (2) has the same benefit package or a benefit package with lesser benefits.</summary>
