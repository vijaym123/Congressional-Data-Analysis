  <summary>6/10/2010--Introduced.
Improving Nutrition for America's Children Act - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to revise the school lunch and breakfast programs, the summer food service program, the child and adult care food program (CACFP), and the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC program). Reauthorizes appropriations for such programs through FY2015. Includes among such revisions: (1) encouraging the direct certification of children who receive other public assistance as eligible for free meals under the school lunch and breakfast programs; (2) establishing new mechanisms by which schools or local educational agencies (LEAs) with very high proportions of low-income children can receive federal reimbursement for free or reduced price meals under such programs without collecting individual paper applications from households; (3) establishing a program awarding competitive grants to states and, through them, competitive subgrants to LEAs to establish or expand the school breakfast program at low-income schools; (4) expanding the access of low-income rural areas to the summer food service program; (5) requiring updates to meal patterns and nutrition standards for the school lunch and breakfast programs based on recommendations made by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS); (6) requiring the establishment of science-based nutrition standards for all foods sold in schools outside the school lunch and breakfast programs; (7) requiring LEAs participating in the school lunch and breakfast programs to establish local school wellness policies for their schools that include goals for nutrition promotion and education, physical activity and education, and other school-based activities that promote student wellness; (8) requiring reimbursable meals and snacks provided under the CACFP to meet the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans and certain authoritative scientific recommendations; (9) encouraging WIC program participants to breastfeed; and (10) requiring WIC electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems to be implemented nationwide by October 1, 2020.</summary>
