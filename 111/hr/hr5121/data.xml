Global Sexual and Reproductive Health Act of 2010 - Authorizes the President to provide assistance to: (1) support the achievement of universal access to sexual and reproductive health in developing countries and to ensure that individuals and couples can freely and responsibly determine the number, timing, and spacing of their children and have the means to do so; (2) reduce the incidence of unsafe abortion in developing countries and provide care for women experiencing injury or illness from complications of unsafe abortion; (3) ensure that sexual and reproductive health services are provided in developing countries at every phase of a humanitarian emergency; and (4) ensure access to sexual and reproductive health care for young people in developing countries. Directs the President to implement a strategy to improve and create linkages among the various components of sexual and reproductive health to ensure that individual men and women are provided with a continuum of appropriate sexual and reproductive health services. States that assistance under this Act shall: (1) promote coordination between and among donors, the private sector, nongovernmental and civil society organizations, and governments in order to support sexual and reproductive health programs in developing countries; and (2) be used for the conduct of formative research and to monitor and evaluate program effectiveness.</summary>
