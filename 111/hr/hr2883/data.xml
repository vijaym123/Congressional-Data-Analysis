Directs the Administrator to establish a threshold quantity for the release or theft of each such substance. Sets forth requirements and deadlines for assessment certification, submission, review, approval, and disclosure. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to a state, municipality, or intermunicipal or interstate agency to conduct a vulnerability assessment of a publicly owned treatment works, to implement specified security enhancements to reduce identified vulnerabilities, and to provide for security-related training of treatment works employees and training for emergency response providers.
