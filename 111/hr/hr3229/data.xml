  <summary>7/15/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) to recognize the village of Alexander Creek, Alaska, as eligible for land and benefits under the Act, notwithstanding specified provisions of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Establishes in the Treasury the Alexander Creek account and makes the account's funds available to Alexander Creek Incorporated for purchasing property sold at public sale. Increases the existing CIRI Property Account's balance by the subsurface value of Alexander Creek's selections. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate for a land exchange to acquire the surface estate in lands not in any conservation system unit from Alaska or the Mantanuska-Susitna Borough to enable Alexander Creek to obtain additional public lands in Alexander Creek's original withdrawal area in Alaska. Requires the subsurface estate to the lands conveyed to Alexander Creek to be conveyed to CIRI. Deems Alexander Creek, on completion (and acceptance by Alexander Creek) of an appraisal, to have accepted the terms of this Act in lieu of any other land entitlement it could have received as a village under ANCSA. Requires that such acceptance satisfy all claims of Alexander Creek against the United States. Requires Alexander Creek to notify each Alexander Creek member that the members will cease to receive benefits from CIRI as at-large shareholders and that all future resource payments from the Region will be made to the Village Corporation. Relieves CIRI from liability under any state, federal, or local law for damages related to that payment cessation.</summary>
