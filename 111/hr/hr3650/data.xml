  <summary>3/12/2010--Passed House amended.
Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act of 2010 - (Sec. 4) Amends the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 to require the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, through the Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia, to establish and maintain a National Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Program. Directs the Under Secretary, through the Program, to coordinate the efforts of the Task Force to: (1) develop and promote a national strategy to address and respond to marine and freshwater harmful algal bloom and hypoxia events; (2) integrate the research of federal programs that address the chemical, biological, and physical components of such events; (3) coordinate with state, tribal, and local government agencies and programs that address such events; (4) identify additional research, development, and demonstration needs and priorities; (5) integrate, coordinate, and augment existing education programs to improve public understanding and awareness of the causes, impacts, and mitigation efforts for such events; and (6) provide assistance to regional, state, tribal and local efforts to develop strategies for addressing such events. Directs the Under Secretary to: (1) work cooperatively to avoid duplication of efforts with other agencies; and (2) work, through the Task Force, with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to the freshwater aspects of the Program. Directs the Under Secretary to: (1) maintain and enhance existing competitive grant programs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) relating to such events; (2) carry out event response activities; and (3) enhance communication and coordination among federal agencies carrying out marine and freshwater harmful algal bloom and hypoxia activities; and (4) increase the availability of analytical facilities and technologies, operational forecasts, and reference and research materials to appropriate public and private entities. Directs the Under Secretary: (1) through the Task Force, to transmit to Congress and publish an action strategy that identifies Program activities, the timeline, and the roles and responsibilities of each federal agency in the Task Force; (2) to periodically review and revise such strategy; and (3) to report to Congress on the activities carried out, the budget for such activities, progress in implementing the strategy, and the need to revise or terminate Program activities or projects. (Sec. 5) Requires the Under Secretary, through the Task Force, to: (1) oversee the development and implementation of regional research and action plans for addressing harmful algal bloom and hypoxia and to identify the appropriate regions and sub-regions to be addressed by each plan; (2) ensure that such plans are completed not later than 24 months after enactment of this Act and updated every five years thereafter; and (3) coordinate with state coastal management and planning officials, tribal resource management officials, and state water management and watershed officials, and consult with public health officials, emergency management officials, economists, affected industries and businesses, and scientists, in developing the plans. (Sec. 6) Requires the Administrator, through the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force, to complete and transmit to the Congress and the President, within 12 months after enactment of this Act and every two years thereafter, a report on progress made toward attaining the goals of the Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan 2008. (Sec. 7) Requires the Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia to: (1) complete and submit to Congress and the President, within one year after enactment of this Act, an assessment of hypoxia in the coastal and estuarine waters of the Pacific Northwest; and (2) include in the regionally appropriate regional research and action plan a plan for reducing, mitigating, and controlling hypoxia in the coastal and estuarine waters of the Pacific Northwest. (Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015.</summary>
