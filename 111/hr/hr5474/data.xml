  <summary>5/28/2010--Introduced.
Hospital Reclassification Correction Act of 2010 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to prohibit the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board, in rendering decisions on applications for a change in geographic classification, from rejecting the application of a hospital which is the only subsection (d) hospital in its Metropolitan Statistical Area on the basis of any comparison between the hospital's average hourly wage and the average hourly wage of hospitals in the area in which it is located. (Generally, a subsection [d] hospital is an acute care hospital particularly one that receives payment under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system [IPPS] when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)</summary>
