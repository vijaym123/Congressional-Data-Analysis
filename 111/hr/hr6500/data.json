    "text": "Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME) Act - Amends the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, source of income, or marital status in housing sales and rentals, residential real estate-related transactions, and brokerage services. Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1968 to prohibit the intimidation, interference, or injury of individuals because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, source of income, or marital status. Redefines \"discriminatory housing practice\" to specify that the definition: (1) applies regardless of whether the discriminatory practices occur pre- or post-acquisition; and (2) includes a failure to comply with administrative requirements of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including related regulations, in a manner affirmatively to further nondiscrimination policies. Redefines \"familial status\" to include individuals (under age 18) residing with: (1) a foster parent or another person having physical custody of such individuals; or (2) anyone standing in loco parentis of such individuals (currently, the designee of such parent or other person having such custody, with the parent's or other person's written permission). Amends the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act to grant the Attorney General pre-litigation subpoena power if there is reason to believe that any person may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary material or information relevant to an investigation under the respective Act. States that discrimination against a person because of a handicap includes the failure, in connection with a real estate-related transaction, to make reasonable accommodations for such persons. Revises the limitations on filing complaints and commencing civil actions by certain individuals alleging discriminatory housing practices to deem that the failure to design and construct a dwelling that meets requirements for reasonable modifications for handicapped persons shall continue (and with it the alleged discriminatory housing practice) until such time as the dwelling conforms to them."
