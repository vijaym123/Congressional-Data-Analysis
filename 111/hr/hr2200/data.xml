(Sec. 215) Directs the Assistant Secretary to ensure that whole-body imaging technology is used for the screening of passengers only in accordance with specified requirements. Prohibits the use of whole-body imaging technology as the sole or primary method of screening aircraft passengers. Allows its use only if another method of screening, such as metal detection, demonstrates cause for preventing a passenger from boarding an aircraft. Requires that passengers: (1) be provided information on the operation of such technology and specified related matters, including privacy policies and the right to request a pat-down search; and (2) be offered such a pat-down search in lieu of such screening. Prohibits the storage, transfer, sharing, or copying in any form of an image of a passenger generated by whole-body imaging technology after a boarding determination is made. Subtitle B: Other Matters - (Sec. 221) Requires the Assistant Secretary to develop a strategic risk-based plan to improve airport transportation security that includes best practices to make airport perimeter access controls more secure. (Sec. 222) Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on progress made by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement the advanced passenger prescreening system.

Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2011. (Sec. 224) Requires the Assistant Secretary to: (1) establish training programs to update transportation security officers on screening procedures and technologies in response to weaknesses identified in covert tests at airports; and (2) develop, and submit to Congress, a strategic plan for the certification and integration of transportation security technologies with high approval or testing results from the DHS Directorate of Science and Technology and the Transportation Security Laboratory. (Sec. 226) Directs: (1) the Assistant Secretary to report to Congress on deployment of optimal in-line baggage screening solutions and replacement of aging equipment (including explosive detection equipment) at commercial service airports; and (2) the Comptroller General to report to Congress on DHS progress in deploying and replacing such equipment.

(Sec. 232) Directs the Secretary to give notice in the Federal Register that the selection process for security background screening services for aviation personnel requiring background screening is subject to open competition. (Sec. 233) Requires the Assistant Secretary, in order to enhance aviation security through use of the Registered Traveler (trusted passenger program), and subject to certain conditions, to reinstate a security threat assessment program and allow Registered Traveler providers to perform private sector background checks as part of the Registered Traveler enrollment process. (Sec. 234) Directs the Assistant Secretary to: (1) prepare a report that assesses technologies and includes standards for the use of wireless devices to enhance aircraft security and communication between cabin crew and pilot crewmembers, embarked federal air marshals, and authorized law enforcement officials; (2) develop an air cargo crew security training plan for pilots and other crewmembers; (3) establish a process for resolving reimbursement claims for airports that have incurred eligible costs for development of partial or completed in-line baggage systems before enactment of this Act, as well as reimburse airports that have incurred less than 90% of such costs after August 3, 2007, in an amount equal to the difference for such eligible costs; and (4) report to Congress on the results of the completed whole body imaging technology pilot, including how privacy protections were integrated.
