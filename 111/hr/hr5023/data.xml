  <summary>4/14/2010--Introduced.
Requirements, Expectations, and Standard Procedures for Executive Consultation with Tribes Act or the RESPECT Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that consultation with Indian tribes constitutes more than simply notifying an Indian tribe about a planned undertaking and that consultation means the process of seeking, discussing, and considering the views of participants, and, where feasible, seeking agreement with them regarding proposed activities and other matters. Outlines the consultation procedure, including requiring federal agencies to: (1) have an accountable process to ensure meaningful and timely input by Indian tribes prior to undertaking any activity that may have substantial direct impacts on the lands or interests of one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the federal government and Indian tribes; (2) consult with Indian tribes concerning all activities that would affect any part of any federal land that shares a border with Indian country; (3) recognize and respect Indian tribal self-government and sovereignty, honor tribal treaty and other rights, and strive to meet the responsibilities that arise from the unique legal relationship between the federal government and Indian tribal governments; and (4) review the processes under which Indian tribes apply for waivers of statutory and regulatory requirements and take appropriate steps to streamline those processes. Permits an Indian tribe alleging that the requirements of this Act have not been met to bring a civil action in a U.S. district court.</summary>
