  <summary>9/15/2009--Introduced.
Everyone Deserves Unconditional Access to Education (EDUCATE) Act - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to reauthorize and make appropriations for the grant program to assist states and outlying areas in providing special education and related services to children with disabilities. Sets the amount to be authorized and the amount to be appropriated for each fiscal year from FY2010-FY2015 as the greater of: (1) a specified amount; or (2) a specified percentage of an amount determined pursuant to a formula that multiplies the number of children receiving special education services by the average per-pupil expenditure in public elementary and secondary schools. Authorizes appropriations for FY2016 and thereafter that equal 40% of the amount determined using such formula. Makes appropriations for FY2016 and thereafter that are determined by subtracting a specified amount from the amount authorized. Requires amounts appropriated to be expended consistent with pay-as-you-go requirements.</summary>
