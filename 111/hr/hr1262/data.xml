Requires the Administrator to report to Congress on the results of such grants by October 1, 2011. Subtitle B: Construction of Treatment Works - (Sec. 1201) Provides that a community seeking financial assistance from the state water pollution control revolving fund for the replacement or major rehabilitation of a sewage collection system existing on January 1, 2007, or for the construction of a new system shall be eligible for such assistance, provided: (1) the replacement and rehabilitation of the existing collection system or the new collection system is to address an existing adverse environmental condition; and (2) the project otherwise meets the requirements of the CWA.

Authorizes states to extend the repayment period for a fund loan from the current limit of 20 years to the lesser of 30 years or the design life of the project to be financed with the proceeds. Conditions eligibility for a loan on the recipient developing and implementing a fiscal sustainability plan for any portion of the treatment works proposed for repair, replacement, or expansion. Sets forth plan elements. Revises the types of assistance that may be provided under state water pollution control revolving loan funds. Authorizes fund grants to owners and operators of treatment works: (1) that serve a population of 10,000 or fewer for technical, planning, and financial management assistance, user fee analysis, budgeting, capital improvement planning, facility operation and maintenance, equipment replacement, repair schedules, and other activities to improve wastewater treatment plant management and operations; and (2) for assessing the energy and water consumption of the treatment works and evaluating potential opportunities for energy and water conservation through facility operation and maintenance, equipment replacement, and projects or activities that promote the efficient use of energy and water. Authorizes states to provide additional subsidization, including forgiveness of principal and negative interest loans, to benefit specified municipalities or to implement a process, material, technique, or technology to address water-efficiency goals, address energy-efficiency goals, mitigate stormwater runoff, or encourage environmentally sensitive project planning, design, and construction. Requires states to: (1) establish affordability criteria to assist in identifying municipalities that would experience a significant hardship raising revenue for fund projects; (2) establish a list of fund projects that prioritizes water quality improvement projects for FY2011 and thereafter; (3) provide financial assistance to only projects on such list; and (4) provide an explanation if they do not fund projects in priority order. Requires the Administrator: (1) by September 30, 2011, to publish a formula for the allotment of fund amounts based on water quality needs in accordance with the most recent survey of needs developed by the Administrator; and (2) to prepare and make publicly available an annual report on the performance of the projects and activities implemented with fund assistance. (Sec. 1307) Requires the Administrator to: (1) assist states in establishing simplified procedures for treatment works to obtain assistance; and (2) publish a manual to assist treatment works in obtaining assistance. Prohibits state water pollution control revolving funds from being used for the construction of treatment works unless the steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in such treatment works are produced in the United States.

Title II: Alternative Water Source Projects - (Sec. 2001) Requires the Administrator, in making grants for the pilot program for alternative water source projects, to consider whether a project is located in an area which is served by a public water system serving 10,000 individuals or fewer. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY2010-FY2014. Tittle III: Sewer Overflow Control Grants - (Sec. 3001) Requires the Administrator to: (1) ensure that a state uses at least 20% of its sewer overflow control grants to implement projects to control municipal combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows through the use of green infrastructure, water and energy efficiency improvements, and other environmentally innovative activities; and (2) report to Congress by December 31, 2012, and periodically thereafter on recommended funding levels for sewer overflow control grants.
