Prohibits an individual who is under indictment for such offense from being paid an annuity or retired pay if the individual willfully remains outside the United States for more than one year with knowledge of the indictment or charges. Prohibits the computation and inclusion of interest on a refund of such an individual's retirement contributions for the period after the conviction. Authorizes restoration of annuity or retired pay if an individual who was convicted of an offense against state law under this Act is pardoned by the governor."
