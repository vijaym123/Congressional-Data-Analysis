  <summary>4/22/2009--Introduced.
Protect Children from Dangerous Lighters Act of 2009 - Treats certain novelty lighters as banned hazardous substances under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and applies to them the Act's prohibitions (in effect banning their introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce). Defines as a "novelty lighter" a lighter that has a toy-like appearance, has entertaining audio or visual effects, or resembles in any way in form or function an item that is commonly recognized as appealing, attractive, or intended for use by children of 10 years of age or younger. Excludes from that term standard disposable and refillable lighters that are printed or decorated with logos, labels, decals, artwork, or heat shrinkable sleeves.</summary>
