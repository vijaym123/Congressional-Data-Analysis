Requires the Secretary to: (1) seek to enter into an arrangement with the Institute of Medicine to prepare a report on the creation of a uniform maternity care core curriculum to foster a shared knowledge base among maternity care professionals; (2) make grants to eligible entities or consortia to carry out demonstration projects in academic educational programs to develop, implement, and evaluate such curriculum and interdisciplinary team teaching and learning in maternity care education; and (3) allocate amounts for activities relating to maternity care workforce development. Requires the National Health Care Workforce Commission to conduct an assessment of current and projected workforce needs for achieving the optimal delivery of maternity care services. Amends the PHSA to require each center for research and demonstration of health promotion and disease prevention to conduct community-based participatory research on maternal and infant health.
