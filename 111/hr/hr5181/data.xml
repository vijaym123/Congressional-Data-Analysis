  <summary>4/29/2010--Introduced.
Small Arms Competition and Innovation Act of 2010 - Provides that, if the Secretary of Defense (DOD) determines that the requirement to procure critical repair parts and modifications for small arms from a firm in the small arms production industrial base is not necessary to preserve such industrial base, then any such procurement shall be awarded through the use of competitive procedures that afford such industrial base a fair opportunity for such procurement. Includes pistols within covered procurements for such purposes.</summary>
