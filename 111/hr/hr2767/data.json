Provides that, with respect to participation in an SBIR or STTR program: (1) a business that has more than 500 employees shall not qualify as a small business; and (2) in determining whether a small business is independently owned and operated, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) shall not consider the business as affiliated with a venture capital operating company if such company does not own 50% or more of the business and the company's employees do not constitute a majority of the business's board of directors. Provides limited conditions under which a small business shall still be considered eligible for SBIR/STTR participation when a venture capital operating company controlled by a business with more than 500 employees has an ownership interest in a small business owned in majority part by venture capital operating companies."
