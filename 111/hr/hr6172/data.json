Requires each local educational agency in the state to develop and implement a standard plan for concussion safety and management that includes: (1) the education of students, parents, and school personnel about concussions; (2) supports for students recovering from a concussion; and (3) best practices designed to ensure the uniformity of safety standards, treatment, and management. Requires each public elementary and secondary school to post on school grounds and make publicly available on the school website information on concussions, including information on risks, responses, symptoms, and effects. Requires public school personnel who suspect that a student has sustained a concussion during a school-sponsored activity to: (1) remove the student from the activity and prohibit such student from participating in school athletic activities until the student submits a written release from a health care professional; and (2) report to the student's parent or guardian regarding such injury and the treatment provided. Prohibits a student who has sustained a concussion in a school-sponsored athletic activity from resuming participation in school-sponsored athletic or academic activities until the school receives a written release from a health care professional that: (1) states that the student is capable of resuming participation; and (2) may require the student to follow a plan designed to aid such individual in recovering and resuming participation in a manner that is coordinated with periods of cognitive and physical rest, and that reintroduces cognitive and physical demands on a progressive basis, based on the student's symptoms."
