Special Agent Samuel Hicks Families of Fallen Heroes Act - Authorizes the head of the concerned agency to pay the transportation (including one privately owned motor vehicle) and moving expenses attributable to a change of residence within the United States of the immediate family of a covered employee, including any federal law enforcement officer, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) employee, or customs and border protection officer, who dies as a result of personal injury sustained while in the performance of duties, as well as expenses of preparing and transporting the remains of the deceased to the place where the family will reside following the employee's death (or another appropriate place for interment). Prohibits duplicative payment of such expenses. Declares that no determination made under this Act shall be deemed relevant to or be considered in connection with any workers compensation claim under which compensation may be provided on account of death or personal injury, nor shall any determination made with respect to any such claim be deemed relevant to or be considered in connection with any request for payment of expenses under this Act.</summary>
