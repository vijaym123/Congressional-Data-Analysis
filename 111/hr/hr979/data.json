Requires the board of directors of each recipient to establish company-wide policies for limiting excessive or luxury expenditures that are not inconsistent with the policies established by the Secretary. States that any policy established by the Secretary or any board of directors that is applicable to any recipient of EESA assistance remains effective while the assistance remains outstanding."
