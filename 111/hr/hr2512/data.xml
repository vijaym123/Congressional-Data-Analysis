  <summary>5/20/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any legislation, if that measure or any accompanying report or joint explanatory statement of managers contains any earmark for which the intended recipient is a private, for-profit entity. Permits waiver or suspension of such prohibition, or successful appeals from rulings of the Chair, only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Senate.</summary>
