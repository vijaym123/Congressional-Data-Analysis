Life Sciences Jobs and Investment Act of 2010 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) an increased research tax credit for qualified initial life sciences research expenses; and (2) certain corporations a tax deduction for investments in the United States to hire scientists and researchers engaged in life science research and to fund life science research at universities, qualified research incubators, and other qualified organizations. Terminates such tax incentives after 2015. Defines "qualified initial life sciences research expenses" as amounts, up to $150 million, attributable to the study of biology, biochemistry, biophysics, bioengineering, microbiology, genetics, or physiology, but excluding sociology or psychology.</summary>
