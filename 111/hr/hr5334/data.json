Requires the Secretary to develop a management plan for the Conservation Area. Bars the changing of the management status of any area within the boundary of the Conservation Area that is: (1) designated as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System; or (2) managed as an area of critical environmental concern. Designates the Cerro Del Yuta Wilderness and Rio San Antonio Wilderness as wilderness and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Releases the public land within the San Antonio Wilderness Study Area not designated as wilderness from further study for designation as wilderness. Requires the Conservation Area and the wilderness areas designated by this Act to be administered as components of the National Landscape Conservation System."
