  <summary>7/15/2010--Introduced.
Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to allow students who are pursuing a postbaccalaureate professional certification or licensing credential required for employment as a teacher to receive a Pell grant even if their institution of higher education (IHE) offers a baccalaureate degree in education, provided they do not live within 45 miles of an IHE that offers such a postbaccalaureate program but not a baccalaureate degree in education. (Currently, students are not eligible for Pell grants for such postbaccalaureate studies if their IHE offers a baccalaureate degree in education.)</summary>
