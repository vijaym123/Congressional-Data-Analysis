  <summary>4/21/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 to require, in making a determination whether a democratically elected Cuban government exists, that Cuba cease providing a safe harbor to individuals who have been legally indicted or convicted of serious criminal offenses, including convicted felon William Morales, and all other individuals who have fled from the United States to Cuba to avoid U.S. prosecution or confinement. (Requires that such a determination be made before economic assistance may be provided for Cuba.)</summary>
