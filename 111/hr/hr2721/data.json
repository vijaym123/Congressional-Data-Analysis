Makes it the mission of the SES Resource Office to: (1) improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity of the Senior Executive Service (SES) through policy formulation and oversight; (2) advance the professionalism of the SES; and (3) recruit qualified individuals from appropriate sources to ensure that the SES is reflective of the nation's diversity. Sets forth the functions of the SES Resource Office with respect to the management, training, oversight, and recruitment activities of the SES. Revises the career appointments recruiting process to require agency heads to ensure diversity of executive resources boards and any subgroup or other evaluation panel related to the merit staffing process for career appointees by including members of racial and ethnic minority groups, women, and individuals with disabilities. Requires each federal agency to submit to OPM a plan to enhance and maximize opportunities for the advancement and appointment of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities to the SES."
