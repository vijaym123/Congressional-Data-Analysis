Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to make the prohibition against health plans rescinding coverage of an enrollee effective on the day of enactment of PPACA. Requires a health plan that rescinded the coverage of an enrollee during the period beginning on March 23, 2010, and ending on the date of enactment of this Act to reinstate such enrollee in the plan or coverage and treat claims for services furnished to such enrollee during such period as if such rescission had not occurred. Exempts the plan or issuer from any penalty for any violation occurring during such period.</summary>
