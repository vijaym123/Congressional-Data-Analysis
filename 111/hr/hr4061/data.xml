  <summary>2/4/2010--Passed House amended.
Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2010 - Title I: Research and Development - (Sec. 103) Directs specified federal agencies participating in the National High-Performance Computing Program to: (1) transmit to Congress a cybersecurity strategic research and development plan and triennial updates; and (2) develop and annually update an implementation roadmap for such plan. Specifies the plan's contents, including that it shall: (1) specify near-term, mid-term, and long-term Program research objectives; (2) describe how the Program will establish a national research infrastructure to create next generation networking and information technology systems; (3) outline how the United States can work with our international partners on cybersecurity research and development (R&amp;D) issues where appropriate; (4) describe how the Program will foster a more diverse workforce in this area; and (5) describe how the Program will strengthen cybersecurity education and training programs to ensure an adequate, well-trained workforce. Instructs the participating agencies, in developing and updating the strategic plan, to solicit recommendations and advice from the advisory committee on high-performance computing and a wide range of specified stakeholders, including from industry, academia, and National Laboratories. (Sec. 104) Provides for the award of computer and network security research grants by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the research areas of social and behavioral factors, including human-computer interactions, and identity management, as well as in the detection, investigation, and prosecution of cyber-crimes involving organized crime, intellectual property, and crimes against children. (Sec. 105) Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2014 for such grants. Requires applications for the establishment of Computer and Network Security Research Centers to include a description of how such Centers will partner with government laboratories, for-profit entities, other institutions of higher education, or nonprofit research institutions. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2014. Authorizes appropriations to NSF for FY2010-FY2014 for: (1) computer and network security capacity building grants; (2) grants under the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act for the national advanced scientific and technical education program and national centers of scientific and technical education; and (3) grants for graduate traineeships programs in computer and network security research. Authorizes the use of computer and network security capacity building grants for activities that revise curricula on the principles and techniques of designing secure software in order to better prepare undergraduate and master's degree students for careers in computer and network security. Requires the NSF Director to carry out a program of awarding fellowships to encourage young scientists and engineers to conduct postdoctoral research in the fields of cybersecurity and information assurance, including the research areas under which computer and network security research grants are awarded. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2014. Prohibits the use of any of the funds appropriated under this section for congressional earmarks. Authorizes the use of computer and network security capacity building grants for activities that establish or enhance collaboration in computer and network security between community colleges, universities, and Manufacturing Extension Partnership Centers. (Sec. 106) Requires the NSF Director to carry out a Scholarship for Service program to recruit and train the next generation of federal cybersecurity professionals and to increase the capacity of the higher education system to produce an information technology workforce with the skills necessary to enhance the security of the nation's communications and information infrastructure. Requires the program to: (1) provide scholarships for tuition, fees, and a stipend for up to two years to students pursuing a bachelor's or master's degree and up to three years to students pursuing a doctoral degree in a cybersecurity field upon condition that a scholarship recipient, upon the completion of the degree, serves as cybersecurity professional within the federal workforce (or serves in another specified capacity if such federal employment is not offered) for a specified period of time; (2) provide scholarship recipients with summer internships or other temporary appointments in the federal information technology workforce, or at such Director's discretion, with appropriate private sector entities; and (3) increase the capacity of institutions of higher education throughout the United States to produce highly qualified cybersecurity professionals, through grants that support such activities as faculty professional development, institutional partnerships, development of cybersecurity-related courses and curricula, and outreach to secondary schools and two-year institutions to increase interest and recruitment of students into cybersecurity-related fields. Authorizes appropriations to NSF for FY2010-FY2014 to carry out such program.
