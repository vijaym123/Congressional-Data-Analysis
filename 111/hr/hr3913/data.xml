  <summary>6/28/2010--Passed House amended.
(Sec. 1) Amends the District of Columbia Code to direct the Mayor of the District of Columbia, in coordination with the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, to establish a program that allows the Mayor to provide educational assistance to members of the District of Columbia National Guard who have satisfactorily completed their initial active duty service and agree to serve for at least six years. Requires such assistance to be used by members for expenses incurred in pursuing their first undergraduate, master's, vocational, or technical degree or certification at an approved institution of higher education. Limits such assistance to no more than $400 per credit hour and no more than $6,000 per year for each eligible member of the District of Columbia National Guard. Prohibits members who are receiving a Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship from receiving this Act's assistance; though permits recipients of this Act's assistance to receive educational assistance under other programs. Authorizes appropriations. Allows the Mayor to accept donations of services or property for the program. (Sec. 2) Provides that the budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You Go Act of 2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest statement titled "Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation" for this Act, submitted by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted before vote on passage.</summary>
