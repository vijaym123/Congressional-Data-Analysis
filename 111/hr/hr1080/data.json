Authorizes appropriations to carry out provisions related to IUU and to equivalent conservation measures. (Sec. 3) Amends the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act to require denial of port privileges and other sanctions for vessels of a nation the Secretary has given a negative IUU or conservation certification and prohibits importing fish and fish products and sport fishing equipment from nations with either of such negative certifications. (Sec. 4) Amends the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950 to make it unlawful for a person in charge of a fishing vessel of the United States to (under current law, to knowingly) transport, purchase, sell, offer for sale, import, export, or possess any fish taken in violation of regulations made under specified provisions of the Convention for the Establishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission. Modifies penalties for violation of regulations promulgated pursuant to the Convention. (Sec. 6) Amends the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985 to modify penalties for violation of the Act.

Modifies prohibitions and related penalties under the Act. (Sec. 8) Amends the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988 to modify penalties under the Act. (Sec. 9) Amends the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 remove a requirement that, in order to be a violation of the Act, a person knew, or reasonably should have known, that an Antarctic marine living resource was harvested in violation of the Act.

Removes language requiring an annual report to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate regarding the conservation and management of highly migratory species. (Sec. 11) Amends the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995 to modify provisions relating to the validity of high seas fishing permits, including removing a five year permit term and voiding the permit if: (1) any other required permit or authorization is expired, revoked, or suspended; or (2) the vessel is no longer documented under the laws of the United States. (Sec. 12) Amends the Pacific Whiting Act of 2006 to direct the Secretary to appoint no more than 2 (under current law, to appoint between 6 and 12) individuals to serve as scientific experts on the joint technical committee established by the Agreement between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting. (Sec. 13) Amends the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act to modify the penalties under the Act. (Sec. 14) Amends the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 to expand enforcement powers under the Act. (Sec. 15) Amends the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act of 1995 to modify penalties under the Act.
