(Sec. 11) Amends the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995 to modify provisions relating to the validity of high seas fishing permits, including removing a five year permit term and voiding the permit if: (1) any other required permit or authorization is expired, revoked, or suspended; or (2) the vessel is no longer documented under the laws of the United States. (Sec. 12) Amends the Pacific Whiting Act of 2006 to direct the Secretary to appoint no more than 2 (under current law, to appoint between 6 and 12) individuals to serve as scientific experts on the joint technical committee established by the Agreement between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting.
