Requires the Secretary, acting through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, to make publicly available and update an online bibliographic database identifying systematic reviews for care of childbearing women and newborns. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to: (1) designate maternity care health professional shortage areas under the National Health Service Corps program; (2) establish a loan repayment program to alleviate critical shortages of maternal care professionals; and (3) award planning and implementation grants to address workforce disparities for such professionals. Directs the Secretary to support the establishment of two additional Centers for Excellence on Optimal Maternity Outcomes to conduct research to improve maternity outcomes. Requires the Secretary to convene a Maternity Curriculum Commission to discuss and make recommendations for: (1) a shared core maternity care curriculum; (2) strategies to integrate and coordinate education across maternity care disciplines; and (3) pilot demonstrations of interdisciplinary educational models.
