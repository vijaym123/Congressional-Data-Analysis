    "text": "American Eagle Palladium Bullion Coin Act of 2010 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue a $25 palladium bullion investment coin bearing designs that are close likenesses of the work of American coin designer and medallic artist Adolph Alexander Weinman. Requires the obverse to bear a high-relief likeness of the \"Winged Liberty\" design used on the obverse of the \"Mercury dime,\" and the reverse a high-relief version of the reverse design of the 1907 American Institute of Architects medal. Requires the coin also to bear other inscriptions, including \"Liberty,\" \"In God We Trust,\" and \"United States of America.\" Allows any U.S. Mint other than the one at West Point, New York, to strike the coins, unless the Secretary of the Treasury decides to issue a proof version, which shall be struck only at West Point. Conditions the minting and issuance of palladium bullion coins upon submission to the Secretary and Congress of a marketing study by a reputable, independent third party: (1) analyzing the market for palladium bullion investments; and (2) demonstrating that there would be adequate demand for such coins to ensure that they could be minted and issued at no net cost to taxpayers."
