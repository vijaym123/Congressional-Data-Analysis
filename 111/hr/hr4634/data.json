Requires the Secretary to review, in order to meet such requirements, any fishery closure for which notice was published within 12 months prior to the date of enactment of this Act, and to include in such review the effects of the closure on coastal communities. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on fishery closures established within five years prior to the enactment of this Act."
