Treats the Secretary as the designated agency ethics official for purposes of: (1) taking any action under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 with respect to any person who fails to file such a report, or who files a false report; (2) acting as custodian of, and providing public access, to reports filed under this Act; and (3) reviewing such reports. Authorizes the Secretary, in addition to any other specified action against an individual who fails to comply with this reporting requirement, to terminate and require the repayment of the assistance provided to a financial institution which gave rise to the reporting requirement with respect to any of its senior executive officers. Requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to carry out the Secretary's determination with respect to any assistance to the financial institution the Board or the FDIC provided."
