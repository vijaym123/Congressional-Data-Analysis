Authorizes: (1) any federal law enforcement officer to conduct an investigation of an alleged violation of such Act occurring within the jurisdiction of the United States; and (2) the Board to refer an alleged violation to any such officer (currently, only to the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI]) for investigation. Permits such an officer to investigate an alleged violation regardless of whether such officer receives such a referral from the Board. Requires the findings of any investigation of an alleged violation to be submitted to a federal or state prosecuting authority or the Board. Authorizes the Board, upon receiving the findings of such an investigation, to: (1) recommend to the Attorney General that criminal proceedings be initiated (current law); (2) provide such support to the Attorney General relating to the criminal proceedings as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate; or (3) recommend, in lieu of or in addition to any such criminal proceeding, that the Attorney General initiate a civil action. Allows the Attorney General, an Indian tribe, an Indian, or an Indian arts and crafts organization to initiate a civil action under such Act. (Sec. 103) Amends the federal criminal code to revise penalties for the sale of misrepresented Indian-produced goods and products. Title II: Tribal Law and Order - Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 - (Sec. 202) States as the purposes of this title to: (1) clarify the responsibilities of federal, state, tribal, and local governments with respect to crimes committed in Indian country; (2) increase coordination and communication among federal, state, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies; (3) empower tribal governments to provide public safety in Indian country; (4) reduce violent crime in Indian country and combat sexual and domestic violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women; (5) prevent drug trafficking and reduce rates of alcohol and drug addiction in Indian country; and (6) increase and standardize the collection of criminal data and the sharing of criminal history information among federal, state, and tribal officials responsible for responding to and investigating crimes in Indian country. (Sec. 205) States that nothing in this Act limits, alters, expands, or diminishes the civil or criminal jurisdiction of the state of Alaska, any subdivision of the state, or any Indian tribe in the state. (Sec. 206) States that nothing in this Act confers on an Indian tribe criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. Subtitle A: Federal Accountability and Coordination - (Sec. 211) Amends the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act to replace the Division of Law Enforcement Services in the Department of the Interior with the Office of Justice Services in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Sets forth additional duties of such Office, including: (1) the development and provision of dispatch and emergency and E-911 services; (2) communicating with tribal leaders, tribal community and victims' advocates, tribal justice officials, indigent defense representatives, and residents of Indian country on a regular basis regarding public safety and justice concerns; (3) providing technical assistance and training to tribal law enforcement officials for gaining access to crime information databases; (4) collecting, analyzing, and reporting data on crimes in Indian country on an annual basis; (5) sharing with the Department of Justice (DOJ), on an annual basis, crime data received from tribal law enforcement agencies on a tribe-by-tribe basis; and (6) submitting to the appropriate committees of Congress, for each fiscal year, a spending report on tribal public safety and justice programs and a report on technical assistance, training, and other support provided to tribal law enforcement and corrections agencies. Directs BIA to submit to Congress, within one year of the enactment of this Act, a long-term plan to address incarceration in Indian country. Authorizes BIA law enforcement officers to make warrantless arrests in Indian country based on probable cause for misdemeanor offenses involving controlled substances, firearms, assaults, or liquor trafficking. (Sec. 212) Amends the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act to expand requirements for reporting by federal law enforcement officers, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Offices of the U.S. Attorneys to Indian tribes on decisions not to investigate or prosecute alleged violations of federal criminal law in Indian country. Requires such officials to: (1) coordinate with tribal law enforcement officials on the status of the investigation and the use of evidence in a tribal court; and (2) compile data on crimes in Indian country in which investigations or prosecutions were terminated or declined. Requires the Attorney General to submit annual reports to Congress on investigations and prosecutions in Indian country that were terminated or declined. (Sec. 213) Authorizes the Attorney General to appoint tribal prosecutors and other qualified attorneys to assist in prosecuting federal offenses committed in Indian country. Requires each U.S. Attorney whose district includes Indian country to appoint not less than one assistant U.S. Attorney to serve as a tribal liaison for specified purposes, including, coordinating the prosecution of federal crimes that occur in Indian country, developing multidisciplinary teams to combat child abuse and domestic and sexual violence offenses against Indians, consulting and coordinating with tribal justice officials and victims' advocates to address backlogs in the prosecution of major crimes, developing working relationships with tribal leaders, tribal community and victims' advocates, and tribal justice officials, and providing technical assistance and training and strategies to address victim and witness protection to tribal justice officials and other individuals and entities. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Attorney General should consult with tribal justice officials when making appointments of tribal prosecutors and tribal liaisons and should take all appropriate actions to encourage the aggressive prosecution of all federal crimes committed in Indian country. (Sec. 214) Amends the Indian Tribal Justice Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 2000 to direct the Attorney General to establish in DOJ the Office of Tribal Justice to advise the Attorney General on the treaty and trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes. Establishes in the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys the position of Native American Issues Coordinator to coordinate with U.S. Attorneys in prosecuting crimes in Indian country. Subtitle B: State Accountability and Coordination - (Sec. 221) Amends the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 to provide for concurrent jurisdiction of the federal government and Indian tribes over the prosecution of federal crimes in Indian country at the request of an Indian tribe and after consultation with and consent by the Attorney General. (Sec. 222) Authorizes the Attorney General to provide technical and other assistance to state, tribal, and local governments that enter into cooperative agreements to improve law enforcement effectiveness, reduce crime in Indian country and nearby communities, and develop successful cooperative relationships that effectively combat such crime. Subtitle C: Empowering Tribal Law Enforcement Agencies and Tribal Governments - (Sec. 231) Amends the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act to: (1) set forth training standards for tribal law enforcement officers; (2) increase the maximum age for employment of such officers to 46; (3) require the Office of Justice Services to develop standards and deadlines for the provision of background checks to tribal law enforcement and corrections officials; and (4) grant special law enforcement commissions to tribal law enforcement officers to enforce violations of federal law. Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish the Indian Law Enforcement Foundation to: (1) accept gifts to support public safety and justice services in American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and (2) assist the Office of Justice Services of BIA and Indian tribal governments in funding and conducting activities and providing education to advance and support such services. Establishes the Committee for the Establishment of the Indian Law Enforcement Foundation to assist the Secretary in establishing the Foundation. Authorizes the use of unobligated funds in FY2011-FY2015 to support the Foundation. (Sec. 232) Amends the Controlled Substances Act to: (1) include tribal governments in education and research programs and cooperative agreements for drug abuse prevention and control; and (2) extend certain enforcement authority to tribal law enforcement officers. (Sec. 233) Directs the Attorney General to permit tribal and BIA law enforcement agencies to access and enter information into federal criminal information databases and to obtain information from such databases.
