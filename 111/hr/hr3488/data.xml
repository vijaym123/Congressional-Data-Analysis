  <summary>7/31/2009--Introduced.
Clean Cities Program Authorization Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to carry out a Clean Cities program, as a partnership between government and industry, to encourage and accelerate the use of non-petroleum based fuels, alternative fuel vehicles, and other advanced vehicle technologies and practices that achieve significant reduction in the overall use of petroleum in the transportation sector. Requires the program to: (1) promote the establishment of vehicle and infrastructure projects that incorporate petroleum reduction technologies, including educational efforts on the benefits and advantages of using alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles; (2) provide training, technical assistance, and tools to end-users that adopt petroleum reduction technologies; (3) collaborate with and train fire officials, emergency first responders, and safety code officials; (4) undertake coordinating efforts between federal, local, and state agencies and the alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicle industry; (5) facilitate the development of necessary refueling and service support infrastructure for petroleum reduction technologies; and (6) develop Internet-based tools and resources for the education and training of consumers and program stakeholders. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants to local and state government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicle stakeholders who are working with Clean Cities coalitions to support the deployment and use of alternative fuels and petroleum reduction technologies in on-road vehicles. Directs the Secretary to encourage and support the voluntary formation of local Clean Cities organizations around the country.</summary>
