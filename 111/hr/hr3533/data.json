    "text": "Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), by regulation, to: (1) initiate a program by which a manufacturer or private labeler of a toy or durable nursery product shall label a product as complying with third party testing requirements; and (2) base certification labeling requirements for toys and durable infant and toddler products, at minimum, upon specified product safety design analysis and testing standards (including randomness and frequency standards). Repeals the general product conformity certification requirements of the Act. Delays until August 14, 2010, the effective date of requirements that a manufacturer place permanent, distinguishing marks on a children's product and its packaging that enable the manufacturer to ascertain the product's specific source and the ultimate purchaser to ascertain its production date, location, and cohort information."
