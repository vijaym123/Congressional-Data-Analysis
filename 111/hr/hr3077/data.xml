Authorizes the President to provide assistance to implement program components through U.S. land-grant universities, other eligible universities, and public and private partners of U.S. and foreign universities for: (1) research on problems affecting food availability; (2) agricultural development and trade research and extension services, particularly for women and other vulnerable populations; (3) application of agricultural and nutritional sciences to solving food, health, nutrition, rural income, and environmental problems, especially among populations experiencing chronic food insecurity; and (4) rural population access to national and global markets. Establishes the higher education collaboration for technology, agriculture, research, and extension to provide assistance for policies and programs in eligible countries that advance agricultural productivity and hunger alleviation through partnerships with institutions of higher education. Authorizes the President to provide assistance under this Act or the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for unexpected urgent food assistance needs. Establishes a United States Emergency Rapid Response to Food Crisis Fund to carry out such purposes.</summary>
