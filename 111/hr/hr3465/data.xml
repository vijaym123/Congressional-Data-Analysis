Requires state plans of operation for property transfers to give the same preference.Defines "educational recipient" as a school or community-based educational organization. Defines "federal electronic equipment" to include computers and peripheral equipment, fax machines, and software (where a license transfer is permitted).Requires a report to Congress from the Administrator on equipment inventories and transfers not later than 18 months after enactment of this Act.States that this Act supersedes Executive Order No. 12999 of April 17, 1996 (entitled "Educational Technology: Ensuring Opportunity for All Children in the Next Century").</summary>
