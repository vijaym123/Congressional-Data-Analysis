Federal Internship Improvement Act - Directs the head of each federal agency operating an internship program to: (1) appoint an internship coordinator within the agency; and (2) make publicly available on the Internet such coordinator's name and contact information and information regarding application procedures and deadlines for the program. Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to: (1) make publicly available on the Internet links to the websites where such information is displayed; and (2) establish and maintain a centralized electronic database that contains the names, contact information, and relevant skills of individuals who have completed or are nearing completion of an internship program and are currently seeking full-time federal employment. Authorizes agencies to make noncompetitive appointments leading to conversion to term, career, or career-conditional employment of individuals who have completed an internship program. Permits an intern appointed to term employment to subsequently be converted noncompetitively to a career or career-conditional appointment before the term appointment expires. Directs each agency to report to OPM annually on its internship program.</summary>
