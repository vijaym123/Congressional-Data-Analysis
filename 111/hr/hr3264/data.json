Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to: (1) make publicly available on the Internet links to the websites where such information is displayed; and (2) establish and maintain a centralized electronic database that contains the names, contact information, and relevant skills of individuals who have completed or are nearing completion of an internship program and are currently seeking full-time federal employment. Authorizes agencies to make noncompetitive appointments leading to conversion to term, career, or career-conditional employment of individuals who have completed an internship program. Permits an intern appointed to term employment to subsequently be converted noncompetitively to a career or career-conditional appointment before the term appointment expires. Directs each agency to report to OPM annually on its internship program."
