  <summary>6/19/2009--Reported to House amended.
Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2002 to authorize the Committee on House Administration, by regulation, to provide for the payment of salaries with respect to a month on a date other than the date provided under the Act as may be necessary to conform to generally accepted accounting practices. (Currently, the usual day for paying salaries in or under the House of Representatives is the last day of each month; except that if the last day of a month falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal public holiday, the Chief Administrative Officer of the House pays such salaries on the first weekday which precedes the last day.) Enacts into law H.Res.1068, 110th Congress, agreed to April 15, 2008 (thus permitting active duty members of the Armed Forces who are assigned to congressional liaison offices of the Armed Forces at the House to obtain membership in its staff exercise facility).</summary>
