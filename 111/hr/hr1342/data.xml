  <summary>3/5/2009--Introduced.
Landfill Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require state or regional solid waste plans, to be approved, to: (1) provide for the collection of a fee of not less than $5 per ton to be imposed on all solid waste collected by, or generated by, a municipality (other than fly ash and bottom ash) received by each solid waste landfill; (2) require such fees to be remitted to the local government having jurisdiction over the area where the facility is located; (3) require facilities subject to such fees to report to the state and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the amount and type of waste received, the amount of fees collected, and measures in place to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) and to protect human health and the environment; (4) require a local government to use the revenues generated by such fees to undertake, or to provide financial assistance for entities to undertake, approved GHG reduction projects within its jurisdiction; and (5) require the Administrator to select projects that are identified as the most cost-effective means to reduce GHGs. Requires the Administrator to collect such fees in states that do not have approved plans. Sets forth civil penalties for persons who fail or refuse to pay the full amount of any such fee.</summary>
