  <summary>7/29/2010--Introduced.
Zimbabwe Renewal Act of 2010 - States that it is U.S. policy to support a transition to democratic and economic recovery in Zimbabwe that reflects the political conditions and opportunities created by the Global Political Agreement (GPA). Authorizes the Secretary of State to provide assistance to strengthen the rule of law and human rights in Zimbabwe. Authorizes the President, through the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), to provide assistance to Zimbabwe for: (1) sustainable development; (2) health care; (3) education; (4) agriculture; and (5) clean water. Direct the President to develop an emergency vocational youth work program for the construction and repair of public works of benefit to the entire population of Zimbabwe. Authorizes the President to provide economic assistance to Zimbabwe to support democracy and civil authority, human rights, economic self-sufficiency, education and health care, reconciliation, and GPA implementation. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide technical assistance to the Zimbabwean Ministry of Finance and line ministries. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) forgive the debt of Zimbabwe held by any U.S. government agency; and (2) direct the U.S. Executive Director at each international financial institution of which the United States is a member to vote in favor of programs for Zimbabwe. Expresses the sense of Congress that certain sanctions on financial institutions should be lifted to allow financial institutions to assist communal farmers, civil servants, pensioners, and the people of Zimbabwe, and that technical assistance should be provided to such institutions if: (1) the Finance Ministry of Zimbabwe does not politicize lending or extending credit; (2) no individual who is subject to U.S. or European Union (EU) sanctions serves as a board member, advisor, or employee of any financial institution in Zimbabwe; and (3) no funds are made available to Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank. Lifts targeted sanctions against a person upon a presidential certification to Congress that such person: (1) has taken significant steps to help strengthen democracy, respect human rights, and the rule of law in Zimbabwe; and (2) has played a constructive role in GPA implementation.</summary>
