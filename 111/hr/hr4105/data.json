Excludes the smoking of tobacco products which occurs solely for purposes of research on smoking conducted by an agency. Requires the Administrator of General Services, in conjunction with agency heads, regarding executive branch buildings, and the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, regarding judicial branch buildings, to inform all employees and visitors to such buildings about the smoke-free policy, educate employees about the dangers of exposure to secondhand smoke, and undertake necessary related activities."
