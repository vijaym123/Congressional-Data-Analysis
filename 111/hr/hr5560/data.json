Requires the Director of CDC to award grants to: (1) develop, implement, and evaluate cancer case management and coordination programs to enhance the quality of cancer care and the quality of life for patients and survivors and to improve cancer outcomes; and (2) train individuals to undertake the quality of life needs of cancer patients, survivors, and family caregivers. Requires the Secretary to establish a Quality of Life Advisory Committee to advise, coordinate, and assist the CDC in creating and conducting the cancer quality of life and survivorship activities, program enhancements, and training initiatives under this Act. Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to undertake additional cancer quality of life and survivorship research that addresses pain, symptom management, side effects and late effects, and psychosocial factors to improve cancer clinical communication and care planning, treatment and post-treatment, and follow-up care across the life course."
