Directs OPM to terminate a contract or discontinue a plan that fails to comply. Prohibits: (1) a pharmaceutical drug manufacturer or retail pharmacy from having a controlling interest in the PBM; or (2) the PBM from having a controlling interest in a retail pharmacy. Requires each carrier to certify PBM compliance annually. Prohibits OPM from permitting a carrier that has a controlling interest in a PBM to earn a profit from such interest with respect to an FEHBP contract. Sets forth requirements of PBM arrangements under the FEHBP, including regarding: (1) drug substitution restrictions; (2) PBM reimbursement of carriers; (3) sale by a PBM of utilization and claims data; (4) drug pricing and the basis for reimbursement; (5) provisions of an explanation of benefits to enrollees; (6) nondiscriminatory contracts regarding required participation; (7) OPM access to PBM contract information; (8) civil monetary penalties for making false statements or claims to the government; and (9) reports from drug manufacturers on average manufacturer prices for drugs each quarter."
