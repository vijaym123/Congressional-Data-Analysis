  <summary>11/6/2009--Public Law.
Credit CARD Technical Corrections Act of 2009 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Credit CARD Act of 2009), to make a technical amendment with respect to the timing of payments related to open end consumer credit plans. Adds the phrase "a credit card account under" to the timing requirement to specify that a creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement is mailed or delivered to the consumer at least 21 days before the payment due date.</summary>
