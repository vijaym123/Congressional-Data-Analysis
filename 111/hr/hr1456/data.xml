  <summary>3/12/2009--Introduced.
Consumer Overdraft Protection Fair Practices Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to set forth restrictions upon overdraft protection fees or services placed upon a consumer account in order to cover any debit due to insufficient funds in such account. Prohibits certain misrepresentations made by an institution that it will extend credit to cover all overdrafts. Prohibits specified advertising claims regarding overdraft protection programs or services, including any representation or statement encouraging use of the account as a service to: (1) meet short-term credit needs; or (2) obtain advances on a consumer's next payment of salary, wages, benefits, or other income. Authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to restrict additional acts or practices the Board deems unfair or deceptive in connection with the offering, operation, and advertising of overdraft protection programs and services. Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to set forth restrictions governing overdraft protection services and fees concerning payment of an electronic fund transfer initiated by the consumer at an automated teller machine (ATM) despite of a lack of sufficient funds in the consumer's account. Amends the Expedited Funds Availability Act to prohibit a depository institution from: (1) imposing overdraft protection fees for paying any check drawn on the account in spite of a lack of sufficient funds unless the account holder has affirmatively requested such service; or (2) engaging in a pattern or practice of delaying the posting of any deposit in an account, or manipulating the process of posting any check or other debit against an account, if such pattern or practice results in an overdraft that triggers payment of an overdraft protection fee.</summary>
