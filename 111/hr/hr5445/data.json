Directs the Secretary to establish a five-year program to provide guarantees of up to 80% of the principal of any loan which banks and lenders make at the lowest collateralized rate available to any successful small business to facilitate its U.S. expansion plans. Directs the Secretary to establish a five-year interest rate subsidy program to pay one percentage point of interest on any such loan to the extent the loan's annual percentage rate (APR) does not exceed the lowest collateralized rate available, minus the rate paid by the Secretary."
