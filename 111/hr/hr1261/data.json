Allows the Administrator to adopt additional smoking article standards as appropriate to protect the public health. Sets forth provisions governing cigarette tar yield limits. Prohibits the Administrator from: (1) banning specific classes of tobacco products; (2) requiring the reduction of tar or nicotine yields to zero; or (3) establishing a minimum age of sale of smoking articles to any person older than 18. Requires premarket approval of all new tobacco products. Sets forth standards for the sale of modified risk tobacco products. Directs the Administrator to establish the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee. Revises tobacco product warning labels and advertising requirements. Requires the Administrator to establish standards requiring tobacco product manufacturers to publicly disclose a list of ingredients in each brand style.
