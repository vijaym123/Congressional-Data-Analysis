States that: (1) the Secretary shall treat all applications to take land into trust within the boundaries of the original 1857 reservation as an on-reservation trust acquisition; and (2) all real property taken into trust within these boundaries before or after the date of the enactment of this Act shall be part of the Tribe's reservation.</summary>
