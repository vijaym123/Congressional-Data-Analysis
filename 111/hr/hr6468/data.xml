  <summary>12/1/2010--Introduced.
Rental Housing Revitalization Act of 2010 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to allocate amounts to public housing agencies (PHAs) and other owners of eligible properties for the voluntary conversion of specified existing project-based rental housing assistance contracts through the execution of long-term, property-based assistance contracts or of project-based voucher rental assistance contracts for additional units of assistance under project-based voucher contracts with public and private owners of properties assisted under certain other federal rental supplement, rental assistance, or affordable housing programs. Establishes the Rental Assistance Conversion Trust Fund in the Treasury. Requires the Secretary to establish procedures to implement a residence choice option for housing opportunities for families in dwelling units with converted rental assistance. Authorizes the Secretary to establish uniform policies and procedures to streamline rental assistance programs for such properties. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into property-based housing assistance payment contracts for converted or replacement properties; and (2) provide funds for a PHA to administer or assist in their administration. Limits the term of a property-based contract between the Secretary and: (1) the owner of a property assisted, before conversion, to at least 20 years; and (2) the owner of any other property to the existing term remaining on the contract being converted or, as the Secretary determines, a term of up to 20 years. Allows contract renewals and extensions. Revises the limitation on the percentage of dwelling units in a project that may be assisted with PHA project-based assistance to allow up to an additional 5% of dwelling units housing homeless individuals and families to receive such assistance. Allows a PHA administering project-based assistance pursuant to a conversion to attach it to up to 40% of dwelling units. Makes conforming amendments to the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act and the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968.</summary>
