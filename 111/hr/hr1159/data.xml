  <summary>2/24/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow an enhanced tax deduction for losses sustained from a fraudulent Ponzi-type scheme; (2) extend the carryback period for net operating losses attributable to such schemes; (3) waive certain limitations on the charitable tax deduction for contributions to charities with losses from fraudulent Ponzi-type schemes; and (4) restore the gift tax unified credit for gifts of an interest in a fraudulent Ponzi-type scheme. Defines "fraudulent Ponzi-type scheme" as any fraudulent investment operation that provides investors with returns that are derived substantially from investments made by other investors rather than from profits.</summary>
