Directs the Secretary: (1) to annually review the performance of each grant recipient to determine if they meet annual outcome measures developed by the Secretary; and (2) in awarding such grants, to give a priority to states and agencies that serve the largest population of veterans. Requires a separate budget accounting for such outreach activities. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to establish and carry out a scholarship program to individuals enrolled in a program leading to a degree or certificate in visual impairment or orientation and mobility in order to increase the supply of qualified blind rehabilitation specialists.
