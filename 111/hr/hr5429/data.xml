Investor Deposit Yardstick Act - Extends retroactively the increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) to include depositors in any institution for which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as receiver or conservator on or after January 1, 2008, and before October 3, 2008. Directs the FDIC to take necessary actions to carry out deposit insurance requirements under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) with respect to such depositors, without regard to any time limitations under such Act. Deems any payment on a deposit claim made by FDIC as receiver or conservator to a depositor above the standard maximum deposit insurance amount in effect at the time of the FDIC's appointment as receiver or conservator to be part of the net amount due to the depositor under the FDIA.</summary>
