  <summary>3/30/2009--Introduced.
Arts Require Timely Service (ARTS) Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to adjudicate a visa petition filed by an employer on behalf of an alien with extraordinary ability in the arts (O- and P- visas other than athletes) and an accompanying alien not later than 30 days after: (1) the date on which the petitioner submits the petition with a written advisory opinion, letter of no objection, or request for a waiver; or (2) the date on which the 15-day period to comment upon a petition has expired if the petitioner has had an opportunity, as appropriate, to supply rebuttal evidence. Requires the petitioner to be provided premium-processing services without a fee if such petition is not adjudicated within the required time frame and the petitioner is a qualified nonprofit organization or is petitioning on behalf of a qualified nonprofit organization.</summary>
