Sets aside up to 10% of federal funding to carry out this Act for research and development of fuel efficient port vehicle or vessel technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions, increase fuel efficiency in local port fleets, and lead to increased domestic production of fuel efficient or clean vehicles. Sets the federal share of costs for such activities at no more than 90%."
