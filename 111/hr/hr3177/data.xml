  <summary>7/10/2009--Introduced.
Fusion Engineering Science and Fusion Energy Planning Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to enhance the U.S. capability in fusion engineering science (materials science and technology that focus on fusion energy plasmas) in order to ensure: (1) full U.S. benefit from the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project; and (2) U.S. leadership in fusion engineering science and in the next steps toward the development of a fusion energy facility. Directs the Secretary, in response to recent study and planning activities undertaken by the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee and the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences, to develop and provide to Congress a comprehensive plan identifying the full range of research and development, including fusion engineering science, and the facilities needed to achieve practical fusion energy.</summary>
