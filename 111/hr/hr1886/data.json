    "text": "Pakistan Enduring Assistance and Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2009 or the PEACE Act of 2009 - Title I: Democratic, Economic, and Social Development Assistance for Pakistan - (Sec. 102) Authorizes the President to provide assistance for Pakistan to support: (1) democratic institutions in order to strengthen civilian rule and long-term stability; (2) the judicial system, the rule of law, and law enforcement; (3) economic development; (4) national, provincial, and local governmental and nongovernmental institutions; (5) public education; (6) human rights, including programs to strengthen civil society organizations that promote internationally recognized human rights; (7) health care; and (8) public diplomacy to promote a better understanding of the United States and to combat militant extremism. Expresses the sense of Congress in favor of efforts to assist refugees and displaced persons in Pakistan. (Sec. 103) States that to the extent that Pakistan continues to evolve toward civilian control of the government and to implement economic reform programs the President should mobilize multilateral financial and economic and currency stabilization assistance for Pakistan. (Sec. 104) Establishes in the Treasury the Pakistan Democracy and Prosperity Fund. (Sec. 105) Authorizes FY2010-FY2013 appropriations to carry out this title. Expresses the sense of Congress that U.S. assistance under this title should be made available on a proportional and equitable basis between the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan (FATA) and other regions of Pakistan. Title II: Security Assistance for Pakistan - (Sec. 201) Expresses the sense of Congress that U.S. security assistance for Pakistan should be: (1) used to improve relationships between U.S. and Pakistani military personnel; and (2) fully accountable, contingent upon Pakistan ending support for terrorist groups, and should meet Pakistan's national security needs. (Sec. 202) States that the purposes of assistance under this title are to: (1) support Pakistan's need to win the ongoing counterinsurgency within its borders and to secure its borders and prevent its territory from being used as a base for terrorist attacks; and (2) develop appreciation for democratic governance and for a military that is controlled by democratically elected civilian leadership. (Sec. 203) Obligates FY2010-FY2013 funding for Pakistan for: (1) international military education and training, including a set-aside for training in counterinsurgency and civil-military relations; and (2) the foreign military financing program, including a set-aside for purchase of defense articles, defense services, and counterinsurgency and counterterrorism education and training. States that Congress finds that the government of Pakistan is responsible for making the remaining payments on the 2006 F-16 aircraft and equipment sales with its own national funds. Restricts, with a national security waiver, the use of foreign military financing funds for the purchase of, or upgrade to, F-16 aircraft and munitions. Directs the President to transmit to the appropriate congressional committees a security plan for each of FY2010-FY2013. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should facilitate Pakistan's establishment of a program to provide reconstruction assistance in combat-damaged areas. (Sec. 204) States that: (1) for FY2010, the Department of State's Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (Fund) shall consist of amounts appropriated or otherwise available to the Secretary of State (Secretary) to carry out this section; and (2) Fund amounts shall be used to build and maintain Pakistan's counterinsurgency capability under the same terms as applicable to FY2009 amounts. Authorizes the Secretary, with prior congressional notification, to transfer Fund amounts to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund. Prohibits, with a national security waiver, Fund amounts from being used to: (1) purchase certain F-16 aircraft updates; or (2) make payments on F-16 aircraft and equipment sales. Authorizes FY2010 appropriations. (Sec. 205) Authorizes the Secretary to establish the Pakistan military transition program to foster the principle of civilian rule through exchanges between Pakistani military and civilian personnel and similar personnel from countries in transition to democracy and from North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. (Sec. 206) Prohibits, with a national security waiver, military assistance from being provided to Pakistan beginning in FY2011 if the President fails to determine at the beginning of each fiscal year that Pakistan is taking actions to: (1) combat terrorist groups and prevent cross-border attacks; and (2) dismantle nuclear weapons-material supply networks in cooperation with the United States. Requires a Government Accountability Office (GAO) analysis of such determinations. (Sec. 207) Authorizes FY2010-FY2013 appropriations for this title, other than for section 204.
