  <summary>7/22/2010--Reported to House amended.
Strengthening and Updating Resources and Equipment Act or the SURE Act - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to permit grants awarded under the State Homeland Security Grant Program or the Urban Area Security Initiative to be used for maintenance agreements, user fees, or sustainment costs for purchased equipment related to preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to acts of terrorism. Prohibits the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from imposing any time limitation, including any fiscal year limitation, on a grant recipient using a grant awarded under that Program or Initiative to maintain and sustain equipment that had been purchased with a prior fiscal year grant awarded under that Program or Initiative. Makes this Act applicable to grants under the Program or Initiative made on or after October 1, 2008. Amends the Initiative to require a high-risk urban area, in its application for an Initiative grant, to include the amount of the award it plans to allocate to maintain and sustain target capabilities, including equipment, that have been supported with prior fiscal year funds awarded under the Program or Initiative. Requires the state, in its application for a Program grant, to include the amount of awards it plans to allocate to maintain and sustain target capabilities, including equipment, that have been supported with prior fiscal year funds awarded under the Program or Initiative. Requires the Administrator to: (1) issue guidance defining costs eligible to be paid with grants under the Program or Initiative for equipment maintenance agreements, user fees, sustainment costs, and any other equipment-related costs, as the Administrator determines is appropriate; (2) review and update such guidance as necessary; and (3) brief the congressional homeland security committees before issuing any guidance, or announcing the award of any grant, under the Program or Initiative.</summary>
