  <summary>9/30/2010--Public Law.
Permits any active duty member of the Armed Forces assigned to a congressional liaison office of the Armed Forces at the House of Representatives to obtain membership in the exercise facility established for House employees in the same manner as such employees. Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1992 to convert the House Child Care Center Account into the House Child Care Center Revolving Fund in the Treasury. Transfers to the Fund any amounts in the House Child Care Center Account. Treats the Fund as a category of allowances and expenses for purposes of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1993. Directs the Chief Administrative Officer of the House, instead of the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), to supervise and direct the care and repair of all furniture in the Hall, cloakrooms, lobby, committee rooms, and House offices. Requires all furniture required for the House or for any of its committee rooms or offices to be procured on designs and specifications made or approved by the Chief (currently, the AOC). Restores into permanent law provisions of H.Res. 661, 95th Congress, requiring the per annum gross rate of compensation of the Chaplain of the House to be equal to the highest rate of basic pay in effect for level IV of the Executive Schedule. Declares that the budgetary effects of this Act, in order to comply with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest statement titled "Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation" for this Act, provided that such statement has been submitted before the vote on passage.</summary>
