Prohibits the Secretary from reimbursing a veteran for any copayment or other charge owed to a third party under a health plan contract. Authorizes the Secretary to reimburse a veteran for the cost of the emergency care described above which is provided before the enactment of this Act, if the Secretary determines that it is appropriate under the circumstances."
