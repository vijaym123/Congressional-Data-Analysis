Requires the Commission to analyze specified topics, including: (1) the role of the enterprises in expanding homeownership and in helping housing market recovery; (2) enterprise involvement in the development of faulty risk standards, accounting practices, and the creation and proliferation of the securitized mortgage instrument, and how such instrument affected the solvency of such enterprises; (3) the role of the respective boards of directors in voting for the policies relating to risk assessments, subprime mortgages, and the international securitization of mortgages; and (4) compensation, stock options, and financial benefits that accrued to executive officers and members of the boards of directors. Requires the enterprises and the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to grant the Commission access to requested records and information."
