    "text": "Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act (the Act) to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to publish the American National Standard for Single and Multiple Station Carbon Monoxide Alarms (American National Standard ANSI/UL 2034) and the American National Standard for Gas and Vapor Detectors and Sensors (ANSI/UL 2075) as mandatory consumer product safety standards. Requires the Underwriters Laboratories to notify the CPSC when either such standard is revised and to incorporate the revision in the consumer product safety rule, unless the CPSC determines that such revision does not carry out the purposes of this Act. Allows the CPSC, at any time subsequent to publication of such consumer product safety standards, to initiate a rulemaking to amend either standard to include any provision determined necessary to ensure the safe and effective operation of carbon monoxide alarms. Treats the national standards published by the CPSC pursuant to this Act, including any revision, as consumer product safety rules for purposes of enforcement under the Act. Requires the CPSC to evaluate whether requiring a language or languages in addition to English would improve the effectiveness of the label required to warn consumers of carbon monoxide hazards. Requires the CPSC to establish a grant program to provide assistance to eligible states and local governments to carry out carbon monoxide prevention activities, including activities for: (1) the purchase and installation of approved carbon monoxide alarms in the dwelling units of low-income families or elderly persons, facilities that commonly serve children or the elderly, or student dwelling units owned by public universities; (2) training state or local fire officials in the proper enforcement of state or local laws concerning such alarms and their installation; and (3) educating the public about the risk associated with carbon monoxide as a poison and the importance of proper carbon monoxide alarm use. Sets limitations on the use of grant funds for: (1) administrative costs not directly related to such training of state and local fire officials; and (2) the costs of the activities of such public outreach. Gives priority to applications from states or local governments that: (1) require the installation of approved carbon monoxide alarms in existing dwelling units within which a fuel-burning appliance, apparatus, or device is installed or which has an attached garage; (2) propose to serve vulnerable populations; and (3) have greater than average losses of life from carbon monixide poisoning in the home. Authorizes appropriations through FY2015 to the CPSC to carry out this Act. Requires the CPSC to report on the implementation of the grant program authorized by this Act."
