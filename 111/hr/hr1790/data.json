Authorizes the Administrator to provide emission allowances for carbon storage projects in other qualifying natural land. Authorizes qualifying subnational level activities. Directs the Administrator to prepare a list of countries that have: (1) demonstrated the capacity to participate in international forest carbon activities at a national level; (2) capped greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise established a credible national baseline; (3) achieved national-level reductions of deforestation; and (4) implemented an emission reduction program for the forest sector."
