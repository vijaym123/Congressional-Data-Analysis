  <summary>5/6/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the President to establish a Public Health Advisory Committee on Trade. Requires the composition of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations to include representatives from nonprofit nongovernmental public health organizations or coalitions that promote the public health, increase access to affordable health-related services or products, or prevent and reduce major disease, illness, or a public health problem. Requires the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor, Defense, or other executive departments to seek written advisory opinions from the advisory committees established under such Act throughout the trade agreement negotiation process. Requires such committees, each appropriate policy committee, and each appropriate sectoral or functional committee, before the President's notification to Congress of an intention to enter into a trade agreement, to report to the President, Congress, and the USTR on the effects of the trade agreement.</summary>
