Defines \"high volume seller\" as any person who, through an online marketplace, sells or offers for sale in a single offering goods or items worth more than $5,000, or more than $12,000 in one or more offerings during the preceding 365 days. Requires an online market provider to: (1) retain contact information on high volume sellers for three years; and (2) deny high volume sellers access to the marketplace if such provider has good reason to believe that such sellers acquired their goods unlawfully. Allows high volume sellers to bring a civil action to challenge the denial of access to an online marketplace."
