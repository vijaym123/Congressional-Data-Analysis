    "text": "FAA Reauthorization Act of 2009 - Title I: Authorizations - Subtitle A: Funding of FAA Programs - (Sec. 101) Reauthorizes appropriations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for FY2010-FY2012 for: (1) airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning programs (with a rescission of certain unobligated amounts for FY2009 and prior fiscal years); (2) air navigation facilities and equipment; (3) FAA operations; and (4) FAA research, engineering, and development. Authorizes additional appropriations from the general fund of the Treasury for aviation programs through FY2012. Subtitle B: Passenger Facility Charges - (Sec. 111) Amends the airport improvement program (AIP) to increase passenger facility charge (PFC) amounts that can be imposed by an eligible agency to finance an eligible airport-related project. Repeals the termination date for the pilot program for PFC at nonhub airports to make it permanent. (Sec. 112) Expands eligibility requirements for airport-related projects to include projects for: (1) construction of airport bicycle storage facilities; and (2) an intermodal ground access pilot project. (Sec. 113) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to approve an eligible agency's application for authority to impose a PFC to finance airside projects for airports, provided the agency gives satisfactory written assurances that each contract and subcontract for program or construction management, architectural, engineering, and related services for such projects is awarded in the same way a contract for architectural and engineering services is negotiated with respect to federal property and administrative services requirements or an equivalent qualifications-based method prescribed for or by the agency. (Sec. 114) Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program to authorize, at up to five airports, a PFC to finance the eligible cost of an intermodal ground access project. (Sec. 115) Requires the Secretary to issue regulations that: (1) set goals for an eligible agency to ensure that contracts, subcontracts, and business opportunities funded using passenger facility revenues are awarded consistent with the levels of participation of disadvantaged business enterprises and airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprises that would be expected in the absence of discrimination; and (2) ensure that an eligible agency will not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex in the award and administration of contracts funded using such revenues. (Sec. 116) Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on: (1) the impacts on airports of accommodating connecting passengers; and (2) the treatment of airports at which the majority of passengers are connecting passengers (and not originating and destination passengers) under the PFC program.

(Sec. 138) Directs the Secretary to establish a mandatory training program for airport owners and operators on how to certify a small business airport concession as one owned and operated by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals under the airport disadvantaged business program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2012. (Sec. 139) Reduces the amount of funds available for AIP state apportionments from 18.5% to 10% of the amount subject to apportionment for each fiscal year. Requires additional apportionments to states, however, for reliever and nonprimary commercial service airports (but not for primary airports). Repeals the special apportionment rule for fiscal years in which the total amount made available for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning and programs is $3.2 billion or more. Requires the Secretary to make an additional AIP state apportionment for each reliever and nonprimary commercial service airport (but not for primary airports), according to the same formula used now under the special apportionment rule. Requires a pro rata reduction in such additional apportionment in any fiscal year in which the total amount made available for regular apportionment is less than $300 million. (Sec. 140) Revises the formula for reducing the amount apportioned for an AIP in a fiscal year to the sponsor of an airport having at least .25% of the total number of boardings each year in the United States and for which a passenger facility fee is imposed. States that, in the case of a charge of more than $4.50 imposed by the sponsor of an airport enplaning at least 1% of the total number of boardings each year in the United States, the reduction amount shall be 100% of the projected revenues from the charge in the fiscal year, but not more than 100% of the amount that otherwise would be apportioned. (Sec. 141) Revises the minimum amount to be credited to the AIP discretionary fund from amounts made available for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning and programs. Replaces the current formula for such minimum amount with a flat $520 million. (Sec. 142) Extends through FY2012 the eligibility of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau to receive AIP discretionary grants and funding from the Small Airport Fund. (Sec. 143) Revises requirements for special apportionments for grants for airport noise compatibility planning and programs to replace the 35% apportionment with a flat $300 million. Applies such apportionment, also, to water quality mitigation projects to comply with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. (Sec. 144) Revises exceptions to restrictions on the use of local taxes on aviation fuel or the revenues generated by an airport that is the subject of federal assistance. Excepts from such restrictions any proceeds from the sale of a private airport to a public sponsor that meets specified criteria, including repayment to the Secretary of the remaining unamortized portion of any AIP grant made for purposes other than land acquisition, plus the federal share of the current fair market value of any land acquired. (Sec. 145) Revises certain requirements for approval of applications for exemption from specified revenue use requirements under the airport privatization pilot program. (Sec. 146) Revises requirements for the airport security program, including to increase the allotment of discretionary funds in a fiscal year for such program. Limits award of a grant, contract, or another agreement to a nonprofit consortium that: (1) is composed of public and private persons, including an airport sponsor; and (2) has at least 10 years of demonstrated experience in testing and evaluating anti-terrorist technologies at airports. (Sec. 147) Sunsets the pilot program for the purchase of airport development rights on September 30, 2008. (Sec. 148) Extends through FY2012 the grant authority for compatible land use planning and projects by state and local governments.
