Provides that: (1) a court shall not accept a guilty plea for driving under the influence unless the court has administered to the defendant a specified advisal regarding the possible exclusion, deportation, or denial of naturalization to a noncitizen as a result of a conviction for driving under the influence; and (2) if the court fails to so advise and the defendant shows that conviction of the offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty may result in the defendant's deportation, exclusion, or denial of naturalization, the court, upon the defendant's motion, shall vacate the judgment and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea and enter a plea of not guilty."
