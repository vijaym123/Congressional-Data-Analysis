    "text": "Simple Universal Healthcare Act of 2009 - Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish a Citizen's Congressional Health Benefits Program (CCHBP) to provide comprehensive health insurance coverage similar to coverage that has been provided to Members of Congress and federal employees, retirees, and their dependents under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) to: (1) federal elected officials; and (2) U.S. residents who are not covered under FEHBP. Authorizes the Director to enter into contracts with entities for the offering of qualified CCHBP health plans in a manner similar to the process by which the Director is authorized to enter into contracts with entities under FEHBP. Requires any FEHBP health plan to be treated as a qualified CCHBP health plan. Requires CCHBP health plans to: (1) provide for the same scope and type of benefits that are provided under FEHBP; (2) provide a minimum level of preventive benefits determined by the Director, including vaccines for children and adults, an annual physical, cancer screening, and mental health parity; and (3) provide notice to any covered individual of any benefit or service that is not included in the calculation of the annual or lifetime out-of-pocket limit. Prohibits CCHBP health plans from imposing preexisting condition exclusions or otherwise discriminating based on health status with respect to individuals who enroll upon initial eligibility. Allows a plan to exclude an individual from enrolling based on a preexisting condition during an annual enrollment period after such individual's initial eligibility period. Lists eligibility requirements. Excludes individuals enrolled under FEHBP or other specified public health insurance programs and incarcerated individuals. Requires the Director to promulgate regulations for the use of the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system to verify the legal presence and status of an individual, other than a U.S. citizen, who seeks to enroll in a qualified CCHBP plan. Permits an employer to choose to participate in CCHBP and offer employees qualified CCHBP health plans as employer-sponsored health insurance."
