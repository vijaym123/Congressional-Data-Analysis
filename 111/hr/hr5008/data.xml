Requires any committee that receives such reconciliation directives to be ordered to report a reconciliation bill within 45 calendar days after adoption of such budget resolution. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), on or before February 15 of each year through 2019, to report to the congressional budget committees a target deficit reduction, for the fiscal year commencing on October 1 of that year, necessary to achieve the applicable goals and the anticipated glide path for each such fiscal year until FY2020.</summary>
