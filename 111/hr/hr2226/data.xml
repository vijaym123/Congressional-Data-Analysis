  <summary>5/4/2009--Introduced.
Warren County National Debt Reduction Act - Rescinds specified funds to be derived from the amount apportioned to Ohio under formula grants for other than urbanized areas and made available from division A of title XII of P.L. 111-5 (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for transit capital assistance. Declares that: (1) such stimulus funding was rejected by the Warren County Ohio Board of Commissioners because it was not needed; and (2) the purpose of this bill is to ensure that such funding is returned to the U.S. Treasury to reduce the national debt to be inherited by future generations.</summary>
