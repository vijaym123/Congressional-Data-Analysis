  <summary>6/29/2010--Introduced.
Permanent Prevention of Asian Carp Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to study the watersheds of the Illinois, Chicago, and Calumet Rivers, including their tributaries, that drain directly into Lake Michigan to determine the feasibility and best means of implementing the hydrologic separation of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River Basins to prevent the introduction or establishment of populations of aquatic nuisance species between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basins through the Chicago Area Water System (CAWS) and other aquatic pathways. Requires the study to: (1) include options to address flooding, Chicago wastewater and stormwater infrastructure, waterway safety operations, and barge and recreational vessel traffic alternatives; and (2) contain a detailed analysis of the environmental benefits and costs of each option. Directs: (1) the Secretary to carry out this Act at federal expense; and (2) the President, or the Council on Environmental Quality as a designee of the President, to oversee the study to ensure its thoroughness and timely completion.</summary>
