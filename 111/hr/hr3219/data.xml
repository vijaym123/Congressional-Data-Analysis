(Sec. 103) Reduces from 3 years to 18 months the authorized period for the National Veterans' Employment and Training Services Institute to complete the training of new disabled veterans' outreach program specialists and local veterans' employment representatives. (Sec. 104) Veterans Small Business Verification Act - Prohibits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) from including a small business in a VA-maintained database of small businesses owned and controlled by veterans until the Secretary has verified that: (1) the small business is owned and controlled by veterans; and (2) if the small business owner claims to be a service-disabled veteran, that such person is a veteran with a service-connected disability. Authorizes the Secretary, upon a person's application for inclusion in the database, to access the person's personal information to verify information contained in the application. Requires such application and verification procedures to be followed with respect to small businesses currently included in the database but not yet verified. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary of Labor and the Office of Special Counsel (Office) to carry out a three-year demonstration project under which claims against federal agencies brought about under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) are referred to the Office for assistance, including claim investigation and resolution and enforcement of rights. Requires the referral to the Office of related claims under USERRA. Requires the Secretary of Labor and the Office to: (1) jointly establish methods and procedures to facilitate the review of their relative performance during the demonstration project; and (2) jointly report such methods and procedures to the congressional veterans committees and the Comptroller General (CG). Directs the CG to: (1) report to such committees on such methods and procedures; (2) review the relative performance of the Secretary of Labor and the Office under the demonstration project; and (3) after such review, submit a final report to the veterans committees on such performance. (Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a three-year pilot program (to be known as the Veterans Energy-Related Employment Program) to award competitive grants to up to three states to establish and administer grants to energy industry employers that provide training, apprenticeships, and certification classes to veterans employed by an energy employer. Requires annual reports from such Secretary to Congress for the duration of the pilot program. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 107) Requires the Secretary, by June 1, 2011, to include on the VA Internet website a list of organizations that provide scholarships to veterans and their survivors and, for each such organization, a link to their website.

Requires grant funds to be used to provide job training, counseling, placement services, and child care services to expedite the reintegration of such veterans into the labor force. Directs such Secretary to: (1) monitor the expenditure of such funds; and (2) submit biennially to Congress an evaluation of the grant program. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to make grants to encourage the development of new assistive technologies for specially adapted housing for disabled veterans. Limits grant amounts to $200,000 annually per recipient. Requires an annual report from the Secretary to Congress on grants awarded. Provides grant funds and authorizes grant authority from FY2012-FY2016. (Sec. 204) Waives the fee required of veterans for VA-guaranteed housing loans in the case of veterans who, but for the receipt of active service pay, would be entitled to compensation for a service-connected disability. Title III: Servicemembers Civil Relief Act Matters - (Sec. 301) Amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to prohibit lessors from charging early termination fees with respect to residential, business, agricultural, or motor vehicle leases entered into by servicemembers who subsequently enter military service or receive orders for a permanent change of station or deployment in support of a military operation.

Requires the return of any advance payments made by a deploying servicemember under such a contract. (Sec. 303) Provides for enforcement by the Attorney General with respect to rights provided under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Limits civil penalties to $55,000 for the first violation and $110,000 for subsequent violations. Allows aggrieved persons to intervene in a civil action that has already commenced. Provides a private right of action for such enforcement, allowing any appropriate relief, including monetary damages. Provides that any actions so brought shall not preclude or limit any other available remedies under federal or state law, including consequential and punitive damages. Provides misdemeanor penalties against persons who knowingly take certain actions (evictions, foreclosures or seizures of property, etc.) in violation of rights provided under such Act. Title IV: Insurance Matters - (Sec. 401) Increases from $20,000 to $30,000, effective as of October 1, 2011, the maximum authorized amount of VA supplemental insurance for totally disabled veterans.

Title V: Burial and Cemetery Matters - (Sec. 501) Increases from $300 to $700 the VA payment for: (1) burial and funeral expenses of a veteran who dies in a VA hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care facility; and (2) a plot allowance for a veteran eligible for, but not buried in, a national cemetery.

(Sec. 603) Requires the payment of DIC to the survivors of former prisoners-of-war (POWs) who died on or before September 30, 1999, on the same basis as survivors of former POWs who die after such date. (Sec. 604) Excludes monetary payments from a state or municipality as a veterans' benefit due to injury or disease from consideration as income for purposes of pension benefits paid by the Secretary. (Sec. 605) Requires that, in the case of a veteran who is retired or separated from active duty due to a catastrophic disability, payment of VA disability benefits based on an original claim shall be made on the date the award becomes effective (thereby eliminating certain procedural delays in such payments).
