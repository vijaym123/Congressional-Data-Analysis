  <summary>11/18/2009--Passed House amended.
Amends the Small Business Act relating to the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) to require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that SCORE: (1) carries out a plan to increase the proportion of small business mentors from socially or economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and reports annually to the Administrator on plan implementation; (2) establishes benchmarks for evaluating its activities and volunteers; and (3) establishes a mentoring program of one-on-one advice to small businesses from qualified counselors. Requires the Administrator to carry out a networking program through SCORE that provides small businesses with the opportunity to make business contacts in their industry or geographic region. Renames the Service Corps of Retired Executives as SCORE. Eliminates the Active Corps of Executives. Authorizes appropriations for SCORE for FY2010-FY2011.</summary>
