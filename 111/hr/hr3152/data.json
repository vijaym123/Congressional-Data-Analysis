Repeals the requirement that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) enroll such an individual on a random basis among all plans in the PDP region. Requires the Secretary to enroll the individual in the most appropriate plan based on guidelines, established by the Secretary, that account for the individual's previous prescription drug utilization."
