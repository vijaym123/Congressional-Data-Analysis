Sets forth U.S. policy regarding normalization of relations with Iran. Amends the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 to state that it shall be U.S. policy to encourage foreign governments to: (1) direct state-owned entities to cease all investment in Iran's energy sector and all exports of refined petroleum resources to Iran; and (2) persuade, and where possible, require private entities to cease all investment in Iran's energy sector and all exports of refined petroleum resources to Iran. Directs the President, with respect to sanctions against Iran, to (1) reduce the dollar threshold for imposition of sanctions against persons making investments that contribute to Iran's petroleum resource development; (2) enlarge the scope of activities that trigger sanctions against persons providing Iran with petroleum resources which contribute to Iran's ability to develop chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons; (3) impose sanctions against persons importing Iranian goods or services other than news publications into the United States or exporting to Iran goods or technology for other than humanitarian purposes; and (4) include among listed sanctions foreign exchange, banking, and property transaction prohibitions. States that the United States is capable, willing, and ready to use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining or developing a nuclear weapons capability. Directs the Secretary of Defense to: (1) develop military options to prevent Iran's development or deployment of a nuclear weapons capability; and (2) submit a related annual report to the appropriate congressional committees."
