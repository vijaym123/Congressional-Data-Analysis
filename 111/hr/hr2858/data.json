Allows an organization to provide de-identified patient data to providers treating the same population of patients for the purpose of measuring and improving the safety, quality, and effectiveness of patient transitions from one service provider to another. Requires the organization to establish a Medicare quality accountability program. Adds a program administration component under part B (Peer Review) of SSA title XI. Directs the Secretary to ensure that Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) are provided maximum freedom in designing and applying intervention strategies for local quality improvement. Revises requirements for the quality improvement program, including use of evaluation and competition, quality improvement funding, and qualifications for QIOs. Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to require state medical assistance plans to provide for an alternative quality improvement program."
