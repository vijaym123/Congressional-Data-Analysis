Small Business Early-Stage Investment Act of 2009 - Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish and carry out a program to provide equity investment financing to support early-stage small businesses in the following targeted industries: (1) agricultural technology; (2) energy technology; (3) environmental technology; (4) life science; (5) information technology; (6) digital media; (7) clean technology; (8) defense technology; and (9) photonics technology. Directs the Administrator to make grants to participating investment companies under the program and limits to $100 million the aggregate amount of all grants made to a participating investment company under the program. Requires, as a condition of receiving a grant under the program, all of the investments of participating investment companies to be in small businesses, and at least 50% to be in early-stage small businesses in the targeted industries. Directs the Administrator to monitory participant compliance with such requirements. Establishes a separate Treasury fund for such grants. Authorizes appropriations.
