Specifies that the amounts authorized and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 2011, for such activities are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations, which shall be made available to the congressional appropriations committees and the President. Allows the Director of National Intelligence, with the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY2011 when necessary for the performance of important intelligence functions. Requires notification to the intelligence committees on the use of such authority. Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account for FY2011, as well as for full-time personnel for elements within such Account. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. Prohibits the authorization of appropriations by this Act from being deemed to constitute authority to conduct any intelligence activity not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States."
