Prescribes specifications for such product liability coverage. Declares null and void any defense to a liability claim that is predicated upon bankruptcy by an automobile manufacturer that is a named insured under a liability insurance plan. Requires the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to implement such insurance requirement. Authorizes the Administrator to impose against any automobile manufacturer for non-compliance with this Act a civil penalty of up to five times the amount it would have cost such manufacturer to purchase the requisite liability insurance."
