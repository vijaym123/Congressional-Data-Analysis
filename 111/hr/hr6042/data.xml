  <summary>7/30/2010--Introduced.
Dignity for our Nation's Heroes Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to cover the burial and funeral expenses of a deceased veteran: (1) who is homeless, has no next of kin or other person claiming the body, and does not have sufficient resources to cover such expenses; (2) whose service in the Armed Forces was not during wartime; and (3) who was either discharged under honorable conditions or died during a period deemed to be active service. Prohibits any deduction from&#160;the burial allowance&#160;because of a veteran's assets or because of any contribution toward&#160;the burial and funeral&#160;expenses,&#160;unless the expenses incurred are covered by the United States, a state, an agency or political subdivision of the United States or a state, or the veteran's employer.</summary>
