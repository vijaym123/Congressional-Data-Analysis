Gives the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) full authority, concurrent with that of the Department of Justice, to investigate violations of the Controlled Substances Act or the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Amends the federal criminal code to provide for a fine and/or at least 15 years imprisonment for firearms smuggling in connection with a crime of violence or drug trafficking. Makes a state or local subdivision ineligible for state criminal alien assistance program (SCAAP) funding if such state or subdivision: (1) has in effect any law, policy, or procedure prohibiting or restricting communication with the Immigration and Naturalization Service or other government entity regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status; or (2) prohibits state or local law enforcement officials from gathering information regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status. Sets forth provisions regarding the expedited removal of: (1) inadmissible arriving aliens; and (2) criminal aliens. Makes the basic pilot employment verification (E-Verify) program permanent. Sets forth the following E-Verify compliance schedule: (1) one year from enactment of this Act for federal agencies, federal contractors, and employers of more than 250 persons; (2) two years from enactment for employers of 100 or more persons; (3) three years from enactment for employers of 30 or more persons; and (4) four years from enactment for all employers."
