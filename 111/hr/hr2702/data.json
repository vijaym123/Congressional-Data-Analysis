Directs the President to: (1) notify World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries, not later than seven days after enactment of this Act, that the United States is suspending the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for Brazil; and (2) suspend, not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, GSP and duty-free treatment for Brazil. Authorizes the President to reinstate GSP and duty-free treatment for Brazil if he certifies to Congress that Brazil is complying with the Hague Convention."
