  <summary>4/2/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Truth in Lending Act to set forth restrictions upon the termination of a consumer credit card account due to inactivity. Prohibits a consumer credit card account from being terminated for inactivity unless the cardholder is notified within 60 days before the termination date. Authorizes the cardholder to appeal a termination on the basis of error. Requires the card issuer to: (1) investigate whether such an error occurred; (2) transmit the investigation results to the cardholder; and (3) reopen the credit card account if an error did occur.</summary>
