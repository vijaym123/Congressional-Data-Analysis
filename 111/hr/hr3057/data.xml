  <summary>6/25/2009--Introduced.
Household Product Labeling Act of 2009 - Requires any household cleaning product or similar product to bear a label on the product's container or packaging that contains a complete and accurate list of all the product's ingredients. Treats a product without such a label as a misbranded hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Defines "household cleaning product or similar product" as any substance which is customarily produced and distributed for use in or about a household as a cleaning agent, pesticide, epoxy, paint or stain, or similar substance. Authorizes the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to issue related regulations, including regulations which expand on or exempt from the definition in this Act any product or product category.</summary>
