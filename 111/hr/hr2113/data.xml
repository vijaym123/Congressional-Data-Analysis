Corporate Injury, Illness, and Fatality Reporting Act of 2009 - Requires the Secretary of Labor to prescribe regulations requiring large employers, for each of their establishments, to maintain accurate records of, and make periodic and certified reports at least annually on: (1) the numbers and rates of work-related deaths, injuries, and illnesses; and (2) compliance data, including inspection numbers and dates and the total number of violations and citations issued following inspections. Requires each large employer to identify on all records and reports each establishment and whether one has been acquired, sold, or transferred since the last report required under this Act. Requires the Secretary to issue citations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to any large employer, including those with establishments in states with an approved state plan for development and enforcement of standards, for violations of any of this Act's reporting requirements. Excludes from the meaning of "establishment" a place where business is conducted that has fewer than 10 employees or that is in the construction industry.</summary>
