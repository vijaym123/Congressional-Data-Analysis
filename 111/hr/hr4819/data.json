Lowers the age of eligibility from 55 to 52. Repeals the requirement that the eligible individual be unemployed. Increases from 125% to 200% of the poverty line the maximum income for eligibility. Excludes from the counting of an eligible individual's income any income received by another member of the eligible individual's household. Prohibits any limit of fewer than 40 hours per week on the number of hours per week a grant recipient may permit a participant to work in a job assisted under the grant. Declares the sense of Congress that not less than $700 million should be appropriated to carry out the SCSE Program in each of FY2011-FY2016."
