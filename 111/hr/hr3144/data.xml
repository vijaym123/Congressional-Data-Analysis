Requires a community obesity prevention program to address all the different components of fighting obesity and to include: (1) physical exercise and a physical activity environment; (2) nutritional counseling and nutritional environment activities; (3) education to provide to the community information about the importance of eating healthily and maintaining a balanced diet and of being physically fit and to provide strategies for addressing varying individual capabilities to attain physical fitness; and (4) an evidence-based curriculum using the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) Ways to Enhance Children's Activity and Nutrition (We Can) program and curriculum to guide the program. Requires a program to: (1) make use of evidence-based practices, strategies, programs, and policies in designing program guidelines; (2) develop a communications plan that involves the entire community; (3) have both in-school and workplace wellness programs; and (4) identify a Wellness Coordinator. Requires the executive council and the steering committee to: (1) perform an assessment of the obesity problem in each respective community; and (2) work with the Wellness Coordinator to lay out achievable short- and long-term goals for reducing childhood obesity.
