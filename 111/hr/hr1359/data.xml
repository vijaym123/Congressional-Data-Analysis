  <summary>3/5/2009--Introduced.
Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2009 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to allow an ultimate user who has lawfully obtained a controlled substance to deliver that substance to another person, without being registered, for the purpose of disposal if: (1) the person receiving the substance is authorized to engage in such activity; and (2) the disposal takes place in accordance with regulations issued by the Attorney General to prevent diversion of controlled substances. Permits the Attorney General to authorize long-term care facilities to dispose of controlled substances on behalf of ultimate users in a manner that will provide effective controls against diversion and that is consistent with public health and safety.</summary>
