Directs the Secretary to award competitive grants to states to improve their elementary and secondary school foreign language programs. Requires each state grantee to use its grant to: (1) develop foreign language and international education policy and programs; (2) appoint a state foreign language and international education advisory council to assist it in doing so; (3) designate a state language and international education coordinator or coordinators; (4) adopt nationally recognized standards for foreign language education and effective assessments that are aligned to such standards; (5) implement in- and pre-service foreign language teacher training programs; (6) provide scholarships and incentives to recruit new teachers and encourage existing teachers to receive training; and (7) provide technical assistance to elementary and secondary schools. Directs the Secretary to award competitive matching grants to partnerships between state or local educational agencies and institutions of higher education to develop and maintain, or improve and expand, model programs that ensure the continuity of student progress in foreign language proficiency from kindergarten through grade 12. Requires each model program to include a research and evaluation component."
