Corolla Wild Horse Protection Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into an agreement with the Corolla Wild Horse Fund in the County of Currituck, North Carolina, and the state of North Carolina to provide for the management of free-roaming wild horses in and around the Currituck National Wildlife Refuge. Bars the Secretary from excluding free-roaming wild horses from any part of the Currituck National Wildlife Refuge unless: (1) it is found that the presence of such horses on a part of the Refuge threatens the survival of an endangered species for which such land is designated as critical habitat; (2) such finding is based on a peer-reviewed scientific assessment; and (3) a period of public notice and comment is provided on that finding.</summary>
