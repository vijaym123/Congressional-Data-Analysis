Suspending Travel After Years of Pleasure Trips on Unwitting Taxpayers Act of 2010 or the STAY PUT Act of 2010 - Prohibits the use of appropriated funds, including official funds of the House of Representatives or funds available under any federal law, rule, or regulation, to pay for official travel outside of the United States by any Member, officer, or employee of the House, until the Comptroller General studies and reports to the Speaker of the House and the Secretaries of Defense (DOD) and of State on the use of certain appropriated funds for such travel and recommendations for appropriate restrictions on, and reporting requirements applicable to, such travel which will promote transparency and cost savings. Exempts from the prohibition and requirements of this Act any travel: (1) to a military installation or to a theater of operations of the Armed Forces; and (2) by Members and employees of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, if the travel is for official committee business.</summary>
