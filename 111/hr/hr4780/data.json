Allows an exception when the IC head determines that providing such information would negatively affect an ongoing investigation. Requires: (1) the Secretary to prescribe a process for expediting an official response to any information submitted, and to seek to achieve such response within 24 hours after receipt of the information; (2) such response to include whether the contact of the member or employee with such a person is directly related to his or her duties; (3) the Secretary to annually review and revise the response process as necessary; and (4) the Secretary to report annually to Congress concerning the instances in which such information was provided and the response to the information."
