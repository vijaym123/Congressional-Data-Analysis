  <summary>11/19/2009--Introduced.
Smoke-Free Federal Workplace Act - Prohibits smoking in federal buildings. Defines "federal building" to: (1) include any building, any area within 25 feet of such building, any courtyard, any areas used for children's playgrounds, or any structure owned, leased, or leased for use by a federal agency; and (2) exclude any building or other structure on a military installation, any health care facility under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA), or any area of a building that is used primarily as living quarters. Requires the head of each executive agency, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the House Office Building Commission and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, and the Architect of the Capitol to: (1) take such actions as necessary to institute and enforce the prohibition as it applies to all federal buildings; and (2) implement an enforcement process to impose a fine on an individual who fails to comply with the prohibition ($250 fine for a first offense, $500 for a second offense, and $1,000 for any subsequent offense). Permits a state or local government or a federal agency, including a military installation or VA facility, to implement more protective smoke-free or tobacco-free laws.</summary>
