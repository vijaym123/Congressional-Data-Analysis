Requires any FCC regulation to: (1) be the least restrictive necessary to address market failure and consumer harm; and (2) not prohibit network management from addressing quality of service or measures to prevent unauthorized or illegal activity, including copyright infringement. Requires the FCC to enforce any such regulation on a nondiscriminatory basis between and among broadband network providers, service providers, application providers, and content providers."
