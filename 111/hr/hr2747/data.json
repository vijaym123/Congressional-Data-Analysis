Requires organizations receiving such funds to direct activities toward small businesses: (1) located in areas that are underrepresented in SBIR and STTR programs; or (2) owned and controlled by women, service-disabled veterans, and minorities. Directs the Administrator to establish an advisory board to carry out authorized activities. Provides a two-year period for each grant award. Requires federal agencies, in making SBIR and STTR grant awards, to prioritize applications so as to increase the number of recipients from rural areas. Directs each federal agency conducting an SBIR program to: (1) receive consent to identify the small business applicant to appropriate local and state economic development organizations; and (2) encourage partnerships between SBIR awardees and prime contractors, venture capital investment companies, business incubators, and larger businesses for the purpose of facilitating the progress of SBIR awardees to the third phase of the program."
