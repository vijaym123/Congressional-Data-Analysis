  <summary>10/22/2009--Introduced.
Osteoporosis Early Detection and Prevention Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require a group health plan to include coverage for bone mass measurement for individuals who: (1) are at a clinical risk for osteoporosis, including estrogen-deficient women; (2) have vertebral abnormalities; (3) are receiving chemotherapy or long-term gluococorticoid (steroid) therapy; (4) have primary hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or excess thyroid replacement; or (5) are being monitored to assess the response to or efficacy of approved osteoporosis drug therapy. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish standards regulating the frequency with which individuals are eligible to be provided this benefit. Prohibits specified actions by health care plans to discourage the use of this benefit. Applies these requirements to coverage offered in the individual market.</summary>
