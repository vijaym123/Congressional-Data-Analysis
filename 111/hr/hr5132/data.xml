  <summary>4/22/2010--Introduced.
Mine Communications Technology Innovation Act of 2010 - Requires the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish a research initiative for the development of emergency communication and tracking technologies for use in locating trapped individuals in confined spaces, such as underground mines, and other shielded environments, like high-rise buildings or collapsed structures, where conventional radio communication is limited. Requires the Director to work with the private sector and appropriate federal agencies to perform needs assessments to identify and evaluate the measurement, technical standards, and conformity assessment needs required, as well as support the development of technical standards and conformance architecture, to improve the operation of emergency communication and tracking technologies.</summary>
