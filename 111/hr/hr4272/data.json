Requires each agency with grant accounts, during the first quarter of each fiscal year, to: (1) identify any undisbursed balances in such accounts as of the end of the preceding fiscal year; and (2) return such undisbursed balances to the Treasury by the end of such quarter. Applies such requirement to grant accounts whose period of availability is not greater than one fiscal year."
