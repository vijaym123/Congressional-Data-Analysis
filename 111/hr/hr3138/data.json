Requires any manufacturer of a covered drug, device, biological, or medical supply that makes a payment or another transfer of value to a physician, a physician medical practice, or a physician group practice to report annually, in electronic form, specified information on such transactions to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Requires any such manufacturer, related group purchasing organization, or applicable distributor also to report annually to the Secretary, in electronic form, certain information regarding any ownership or investment interest (other than in a publicly traded security and mutual fund) held by a physician (or an immediate family member) in the manufacturer, group purchasing organization, or applicable distributor during the preceding year. Prescribes administrative penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. Requires report submission procedures to ensure public availability of required information on a website."
