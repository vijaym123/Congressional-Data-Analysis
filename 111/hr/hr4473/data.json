(The special enrollment period is the eight consecutive months after an individual ceases to be enrolled in a group health plan by reason of current employment status.) Requires individuals enrolled in part B during the extended special enrollment period to pay a monthly premium increased by 25% for a specified number of months. Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), however, to reduce or waive the premium increase for an individual who demonstrates that he or she made a good faith effort to enroll during the special enrollment period."
