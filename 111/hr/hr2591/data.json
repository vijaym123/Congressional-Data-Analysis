    "text": "Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2009 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to direct the President, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to modernize and implement the integrated U.S. public alert and warning system to ensure that the President can alert governmental authorities and the civilian population in areas endangered by disasters under all conditions. Directs the Administrator, consistent with the final recommendations of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Advisory Committee (established by this Act), to: (1) establish common alerting and warning protocols, standards, terminology, and operating procedures; (2) include in such system the capability to adapt the distribution and content of communications on the basis of geographic location, risks, or personal user preferences and to alert individuals with disabilities or limited English proficiency; and (3) ensure the conduct of system training, tests, and exercises. Requires the system to: (1) incorporate multiple communications technologies; (2) be designed to incorporate future technologies for communicating directly with the public, to provide alerts to the largest portion of the affected population feasible, including nonresident visitors and tourists, and to improve the ability of remote areas to receive alerts; (3) promote local and regional partnerships to enhance community preparedness and response; and (4) provide redundant alert mechanisms. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct pilot programs to demonstrate the feasibility of using a variety of methods for achieving system requirements."
