Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act of 2010 - Title I: Creation of New Department of the Interior Agencies - (Sec. 101) Establishes within the Department of the Interior a Bureau of Energy and Resource Management (BERM) to administer a comprehensive program of nonrenewable and renewable energy and mineral resources management on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and designated public lands. Directs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to create within the Bureau an independent office programmatically separate and distinct from leasing and permitting activities to: (1) carry out certain environmental studies of the impacts on the human, marine, and coastal environments of the OCS and the coastal areas which may be affected by oil and gas or other mineral development; and (3) conducts environmental analyses for BERM programs. Instructs the BERM Director to implement programs for the collection, evaluation, assembly, analysis, and dissemination of data and information relevant to BERM duties. (Sec. 102) Establishes within the Department a Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) to perform functions, powers, and duties relating to safety and environmental enforcement related to nonrenewable and renewable energy and mineral resources on the OCS, federal public lands, and in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a National Oil and Gas Health and Safety Academy to train oil and gas inspectors; (2) work with educational institutions, operators, and representatives of oil and gas workers to develop adequate programs of administrative training and continuing education of inspectors or other Department personnel; (Sec. 103) Establishes within the Department an Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) to administer all royalty and revenue management functions, powers, and duties previously assigned to the Minerals Management Service. (Sec. 104) Requires the Secretary to certify annually that all Department personnel having regular, direct contact with lessees and operators as a function of their official duties are in full compliance with federal employee ethics laws and regulations. (Sec. 106) Abolishes the Minerals Management Service. (Sec. 108) Directs the Secretary to establish an Outer Continental Shelf Safety and Environmental Advisory Board, to provide independent scientific and technical advice on safe and environmentally compliant nonrenewable and renewable energy and mineral resource exploration, development, and production activities. (Sec. 109) States that nothing in this title shall delay development of ocean renewable energy resource facilities, including: (1) offshore wind development; (2) planning, leasing, licensing, and fee and royalty collection for such development; and (3) the leasing and licensing process for ocean renewable energy resource facilities. Title II: Federal Oil and Gas Development - Subtitle A: Safety, Environmental, and Financial Reform of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act - Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 2010 - (Sec. 203) Revises the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) regarding: (1) jurisdiction of laws on the OCS; (2) regulatory standards governing blowout preventers, well design, and cementing programs; (3) procedures and regular testing of the emergency backup control systems before commencement of drilling operations; (4) independent third-party certification requirements; and (5) submission of state regulatory regimes. (Sec. 206) Requires the Secretary to: (1) review periodically the minimum financial responsibility requirements for leases; and (2) implement a comprehensive review of all components of the federal offshore oil and gas fiscal system. Requires a certification of responsible stewardship meeting specified due diligence, safety, and environmental requirements as a prerequisite for submission of bids or requests for leases, easements, rights-of-way, or drilling permits. Requires the Secretary, at least 60 days before any lease sale, to request a review by the Secretary of Commerce regarding any impacts on the marine and coastal environment of the proposed sale. (Sec. 207) Requires all sums paid either to the Secretary of the Interior or to the Secretary of the Navy under any OCS lease between June 5, 1950, and the enactment of this Act to be deposited in the Treasury and credited to miscellaneous receipts in specified allocations to: (1) the Land and Water Conservation Fund, (2) the Ocean Resources Conservation and Assistance Fund, and (3) the Historic Preservation Fund. (Sec. 208) Modifies the process for approving OCS geological and geophysical exploration plans. Requires approval of a plan within 90 days (currently 30 days) after its submission if certain criteria are met. Requires a plan to include a scenario for the potential blowout of the well involving the highest potential volume of liquid hydrocarbons, along with a complete description of a response plan to both control the blowout and to manage the accompanying discharge of hydrocarbons, including the likelihood for surface intervention to stop the blowout, the availability of a rig to drill a relief well, an estimate of the time it would take to drill a relief well, a description of other technology to regain control of the well or capture escaping hydrocarbons and the potential timeline for using that technology for its intended purpose, and the strategy, organization, and resources necessary to avoid harm to the environment and human health from hydrocarbons. Requires a plan also to analyze the potential impacts of the worst-case-scenario discharge of hydrocarbons upon marine, coastal, and human environments. Directs the Secretary to require that any lessee operating under an approved exploration plan obtain a permit before: (1) drilling any well in accordance with the plan; and (2) any significant modification of the well design as originally approved by the Secretary. Prohibits the Secretary from granting any drilling permit or modification of the permit before completion of: (1) a full engineering review of the well system, including a determination that critical safety systems, including blowout prevention, will utilize best available technology and include redundancy and remote triggering capability; or (2) a safety and environmental management plan that will be utilized by the operator during all well operations. Conditions the issuance of drilling permits upon a determination by the Secretary that the applicant has available oil spill response and clean-up equipment and technology capable of effectively remediating a worst-case release of oil. Requires the Secretary to treat either the approval or a significant revision of an exploration plan as an agency action requiring an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Requires the Secretary to disapprove an exploration plan if: (1) exceptional geological conditions in the lease areas, exceptional resource values in the marine or coastal environment, or other exceptional circumstances would probably cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), to the national security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environments; (2) the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and (3) the advantages of disapproving the plan outweigh the advantages of exploration. (Sec. 209) Requires consideration of the availability of infrastructure to support oil spill response in the timing and location of oil and gas exploration, development, and production among OCS oil- and gas-bearing physiographic regions. Revises other specified requirements. Directs the Secretary to implement a research and development program to ensure continued improvement of methodologies for characterizing both OCS resources and the conditions that may affect the ability to develop and use them in a safe, sound, and environmentally responsible manner. (Sec. 210) Changes from once only to at least once every three years the requirement that the Secretary study any area or region included in any oil and gas lease sale or other lease in order to establish information needed for assessment and management of environmental impacts on the human, marine, and coastal environments of the OCS and the coastal areas which may be affected by oil and gas or other mineral development in such area or region.
