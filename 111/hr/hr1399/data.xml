  <summary>3/9/2009--Introduced.
Maple Tapping Access Program Act - Amends the the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to support state and tribal government efforts to encourage owners and operators of privately held farm, ranch, and forest land to: (1) initiate or expand maple-tapping activities; or (2) voluntarily make the land available to the public for maple-tapping activities. Gives priority to states and tribal governments that propose to: (1) maximize participation by offering program terms likely to meet with landowner acceptance; (2) increase maple-tapping activities and maple syrup production; (3) ensure that enrolled land has appropriate tree stock; and (4) use additional federal, state, tribal, or private resources in carrying out the program.</summary>
