Bed Bug Prevention and Mitigation Pilot Program Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make a grant to the state of Ohio to support a pilot program under which its political subdivisions and housing authorities use grant funds to supplement ongoing bed bug prevention and mitigation activities. Conditions receipt of such grant on the state directing the Ohio Department of Agriculture, working in conjunction with the Ohio Department of Health, to distribute the funds to such subdivisions and authorities that are addressing persistent bed bug infestations and whose residents lack the financial resources to adequately mitigate them. Permits the use of grant funds to: (1) retain commercial applicators of pesticides to perform bed bug prevention and mitigation activities; (2) purchase and distribute mattress covers; (3) dispose of and replace infested material; (4) conduct monitoring activities; and (5) treat used mattresses and furniture using methods proven to control all life stages of bed bugs. Directs the Administrator: (1) after the end of FY2012, to collect data on the number of grant fund recipients and the funds awarded to each, the criteria used to award funds, the success achieved, and documented results of intervention efforts on infestation rates; and (2) to report to Congress by September 30, 2013.</summary>
