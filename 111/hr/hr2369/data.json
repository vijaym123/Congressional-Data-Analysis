Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to make grants for a network of national centers of excellence in mental health and substance use health care.

Directs the Secretary to develop uniform methodologies related to payments for mental illnesses and substance use disorders. Requires the Comptroller General to study the use of publicly-supported mental health and addiction services by individuals with private health insurance coverage. Directs the Secretary to establish a five-year project to demonstrate the impact of creating delivery and financing structures that deliver high-quality, integrated, mental health and substance use health care. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require states to prohibit discrimination against patients being treated for, or health care providers providing treatment for, any medical condition, illness, or injury involving intoxication as a result of alcohol or other substance."
