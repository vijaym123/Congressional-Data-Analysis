Amends the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 to extend through February 28, 2011, provisions: (1) granting roving surveillance authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) where the court finds that the actions of the target may thwart the identification of a specified person or other persons (by using multiple devices or modes of communication, among other means); and (2) authorizing the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to apply for a court order requiring production of tangible things (including books, records, papers, and documents), not merely business records, for foreign intelligence and international terrorism investigations. Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to extend through February 28, 2011, an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) that redefines \"agent of a foreign power\" to include any non-U.S. person who engages in international terrorism or activities in preparation for such terrorism (\"lone wolf\" provision)."
