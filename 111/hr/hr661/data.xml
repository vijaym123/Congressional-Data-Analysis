  <summary>1/23/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 to increase funding for the program to provide coupons for digital-to-analog converter boxes. Directs the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to: (1) expedite the distribution of such coupons by delivering them via presorted first class mail service until February 17, 2009; and (2) continue such delivery after that date if the Assistant Secretary determines that doing so will significantly improve coupon redemption rates without jeopardizing the availability of administrative funds. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to extend through September 30, 2012 (currently until September 30, 2011), the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to grant a license or permit under provisions relating to competitive bidding.</summary>
