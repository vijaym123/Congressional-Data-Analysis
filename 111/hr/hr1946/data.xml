Health Workforce Investment Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish the National Health Workforce Advisory Council to make recommendations to relevant agencies and congressional committees on health workforce issues, including on: (1) the supply and distribution of the U.S. health workforce; (2) current and future shortages or excesses of health workforce professionals; (3) issues relating to foreign medical and nursing school graduates; (4) deficiencies in existing databases concerning the supply and distribution of, and career, technical, and postsecondary education training programs for, health workforce professionals; (5) factors impacting practitioners' selection of specialty areas, including malpractice insurance costs; and (6) incentives to encourage primary care practice in underserved areas. Requires the Council to encourage entities providing graduate medical education to conduct activities to voluntarily address health workforce issues. Establishes the National Center for Health Workforce Information and Analysis to conduct and support statistical and epidemiological activities for the purpose of assessing and improving the supply, distribution, diversity, and development of the health workforce in the United States. Provides for protection of individually identifiable personal data. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to states for: (1) ensuring access to health services for all individuals, particularly those with low incomes or limited access to health services, through an adequate health workforce; (2) improving the supply, distribution, diversity, and development of the health workforce; (3) creating state-specific health workforce goals and objectives consistent with health status goals and national health workforce objectives; and (4) establishing a state health workforce planning entity to establish statewide processes for state health workforce planning. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for research to identify best practices and innovative approaches to improving the health workforce. Requires the Secretary to develop national health workforce objectives.</summary>
