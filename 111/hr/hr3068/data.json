Requires the use of such funds for assistance to: (1) states and local governmental units to redevelop abandoned and foreclosed homes; (2) the Emergency Homeowners' Relief Fund (which the Secretary shall establish under the Emergency Housing Act of 1975) for emergency mortgage assistance; and (3) the Multifamily Mortgage Resolution Program to stabilize multifamily properties that are in default or foreclosure, or have recently been foreclosed. Amends the Emergency Housing Act of 1975 to: (1) increase the maximum aggregate amount of insured emergency mortgage loans and advances; and (2) extend through FY2011 the program for insured loans and emergency mortgage relief payments made under the Act. Directs the HUD Secretary to develop a program to ensure the protection of current and future tenants of at-risk multifamily properties. Amends EESA to reduce the TARP authorization limit in order to offset the costs of loans, advances, insurance, and appropriations authorized under this Act."
