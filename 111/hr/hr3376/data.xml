  <summary>7/29/2009--Introduced.
United States Mariner and Vessel Protection Act of 2009 - Shields an owner, operator, time charterer, master, or mariner who uses, or authorizes the use of, force to defend a vessel of the United States against piracy from liability for any resulting injury to or death of any person participating in the piracy. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to work through the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to establish agreements to promote coordinated action among flag- and port-states to deter, protect against, and rapidly respond to acts of piracy against the vessels of, and in the waters under the jurisdiction of, those nations, and to ensure limitations on liability similar to those established by this Act.</summary>
