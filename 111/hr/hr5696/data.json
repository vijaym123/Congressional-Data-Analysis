Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue a model rule prescribing minimum national standards to implement such right of access. Includes within such right of access an Internet website of retail electric energy information. Requires the Secretary of Energy, in determining whether to award federal smart grid support to a retail electric utility, to give preference to any applicant that has implemented policies for electric consumer access to retail electric energy information at least as stringent as those prescribed by the model rule. Sets forth procedures for state consideration of the FERC model."
