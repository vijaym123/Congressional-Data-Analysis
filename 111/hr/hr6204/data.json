Requires states to develop and implement policies requiring such charter schools to: (1) maintain their financial records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and applicable state and federal requirements; (2) be audited annually by a licensed, independent auditor, with the findings made public and filed with their authorized public chartering agency and state; and (3) address all audit findings and report to their authorized public chartering agency on actions taken to do so. Directs states to: (1) require such chartering agencies to report significant audit findings and the measures schools take to address them; and (2) submit overall summary analyses of the annual audits to the Secretary of Education."
