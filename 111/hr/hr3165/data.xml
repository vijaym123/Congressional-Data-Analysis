Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to carry out a research and development program to: (1) improve the energy efficiency, reliability, and capacity of wind turbines; (2) optimize the design and adaptability of wind energy systems to the broadest practical range of atmospheric conditions; and (3) reduce the cost of construction, generation, and maintenance of such systems. Directs the Secretary to conduct a wind energy demonstration program to measure wind energy system performance under the full productive range of wind conditions in the United States. Requires awards under such programs to be made on a competitive basis with an emphasis on technical merit. Requires the Secretary, in carrying out this Act, to: (1) coordinate with the Office of Minority Economic Impact and with the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization; and (2) provide special consideration to applications submitted by institutions, businesses, or entities containing majority representation of women, minorities, or persons with disabilities in science and engineering. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
