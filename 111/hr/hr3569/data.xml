  <summary>9/15/2009--Introduced.
Sunset All Czars Act or the SAC Act - Prohibits appropriated funds from being used to pay salaries or expenses of any task force, council, or similar office established by or at the direction of the President, if the head of such entity is a Czar. Defines a "Czar" as an entity head who: (1) is appointed (on other than an interim basis) without the Senate's advice and consent; (2) is excepted from the competitive service by reason of the confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character of the position; (3) performs or delegates functions that would otherwise be performed or delegated by an individual appointed by the President with the Senate's advice and consent; and (4) does not have an existing removal date established at the direction of the President or through an authorization of Congress. Requires that by December 31, 2009, any Czar who is not appointed by a former President or the incumbent President, with the Senate's advise and consent, be removed from his or her position.</summary>
