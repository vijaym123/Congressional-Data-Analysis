Exempts from such prohibition: (1) any action under the CAA relating to the vehicle emissions standards contained in Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0171 or Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0472; (2) any action relating to the preparation of a report or the enforcement of a reporting requirement; or (3) any action relating to the provision of technical support at a state's request. Provides that no action taken by the Administrator before the end of such period shall be considered to make carbon dioxide or methane a pollutant subject to regulation under the CAA for any source other than a new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine.</summary>
