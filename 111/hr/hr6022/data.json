Prohibits a business from being included in a database maintained by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) of small businesses owned and controlled by veterans or service-disabled veterans (for purposes of participation in a federal procurement contract program) until the Secretary verifies that the business is owned and controlled by veterans or service-disabled veterans. Subjects to certain penalties any person misrepresenting the status of a business as a small business owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans in order to obtain a federal procurement contract or subcontract."
