Adds to state loan originator licensing law requirements new ones declaring that the state loan originator supervisory authority: (1) has created education and testing appropriate for personal property loan originators; and (2) ensures that additional mortgage lending licensing is not required of a state-licensed personal property lender and has not created unnecessary, duplicative licensing requirements for state-licensed lenders engaged solely in making residential mortgage loans secured by personal property, such as manufactured homes."
