Exempts calls in which there is a disclosure at the beginning of the call of the name of the sponsor or originator of the call and that the call is a recorded message. Defines \"political robocall\" as any outbound telephone call which plays a recorded message that promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes a candidate for federal office and in which a person is not available to speak with the person answering the call."
