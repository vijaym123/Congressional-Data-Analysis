    "text": "Authorizes a state by law to apply certain requirements of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 for an extended unemployment compensation benefit period, with specified substitutions, to the period between August 1, 2010 and September 30, 2011. Eliminates, between such dates, the ordinary 13-week waiting period between extended unemployment compensation benefit periods. Allows a state law, between such dates, also to: (1) reduce from 6.5% to 6% the unemployment rate triggering an \"on\" indicator for any week; and (2) treat as repealed for the extended unemployment compensation period the requirement regarding the average rate of total unemployment in the state (seasonally adjusted)."
