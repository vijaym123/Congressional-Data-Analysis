  <summary>5/21/2009--Introduced.
No More Excuses Energy Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow the issuance of tax exempt facility bonds for the financing of domestic use oil refinery facilities; (2) extend the tax credit for producing electricity from renewable resources; (3) extend through 2018 the energy tax credit for solar energy; (4) set the rate of the excise tax on liquefied natural gas to 24.3 cents per energy equivalent of a gallon of diesel; (5) extend through 2010 the excise tax credit for alternative fuel; (6) allow tax credits for the production of electricity from nuclear energy and the production of fuel from certain onshore wells; and (7) repeal the minimum gas capture requirement for purposes of the carbon dioxide sequestration tax credit. Requires the President to designate at least 10 sites for oil or natural gas refineries on federal lands and make such sites available to the private sector for construction of refineries. Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from denying an application for nuclear waste disposal on the grounds of present or future insufficient capacity. American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish and implement a competitive oil and gas leasing program in the Coastal Plain of Alaska. Repeals the prohibition against producing oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Sets forth requirements for the sale of oil and natural gas leases in the Coastal Plain, environmental protection, transportation easements, and royalty payments to Alaska. Establishes in the Treasury the Coastal Plain Local Government Impact Aid Assistance Fund to assist Alaska jurisdictions that are directly impacted by oil and gas exploration and production in the Coastal Plain.</summary>
