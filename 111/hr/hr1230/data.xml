Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Disease Research and Treatment Act of 2010 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct research on acquired bone marrow failure diseases, which may address factors including: (1) trends in the characteristics of individuals who are diagnosed with such diseases, including age, race and ethnicity, general geographic location, sex, and family history; (2) the genetic and environmental factors, including exposure to toxins, that may be associated with developing such diseases; (3) approaches to treating such diseases; and (4) outcomes for individuals treated for such diseases, including outcomes for recipients of stem cell therapeutic products. Authorizes the Secretary to collaborate with the Radiation Injury Treatment Network of the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program to: (1) augment data for studies; (2) access technical assistance that may be provided by the Network; or (3) perform joint research projects. (Sec. 3) Authorizes the Secretary to establish and coordinate outreach and informational programs targeted to minority populations, including Hispanic, Asian-American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations, that are affected by acquired bone marrow failure diseases. Includes among program activities: (1) making information about treatment options and clinical trials for such diseases publicly available; and (2) providing referral services for treatment options and clinical trials. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, to award grants to researchers to study best practices with respect to diagnosing acquired bone marrow failure diseases and providing care to individuals with such diseases.</summary>
