  <summary>5/20/2010--Introduced.
Preventing Waste, Fraud, and Abuse Act of 2010 - Requires the Attorney General, the Commissioner of Social Security, and the Secretaries of Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor, and the Treasury (agency head), in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to: (1) identify existing federal laws and regulations that may impede the ability to decrease waste, fraud, and abuse of funds appropriated to their agencies; and (2) develop appropriate performance metrics to measure success in decreasing waste, fraud, and abuse. Directs each agency head, in developing performance metrics, to: (1) ensure that such metrics accurately demonstrate the effectiveness of specified programs and activities in decreasing waste, fraud, and abuse; (2) provide estimates for points of diminishing returns on the funds provided under this Act to increase program integrity efforts; (3) identify optimal baselines for each of the metrics developed and appropriate methods to measure variations from such baselines; and (4) set performance targets for each of FY2012-FY2020. Requires each agency head to make appropriate accommodations for innovation and development to address the program integrity efforts for programs and activities identified by this Act. Requires: (1) each agency head to submit an interim and final report to Congress at specified intervals and to publish in the Federal Register and make available on the agency website the performance metrics set forth in the final report; and (2) the Director of OMB to report annually measuring success in decreasing waste, fraud, and abuse of funds appropriated to an agency.</summary>
