  <summary>1/9/2009--Introduced.
Emergency Fueling Station Designation Act of 2009 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a program to address the shortage of fuel along hurricane evacuation routes by providing funds to eligible states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia) to assist in the purchase and installation of transfer switches and generators at designated emergency fueling stations. Requires states applying for funds to provide: (1) identification of hurricane zones and evacuation routes; (2) the estimated number of designated and adjacent emergency fueling stations determined to be necessary by such state using population figures along hurricane evacuation routes as a guide in selecting stations; and (3) specified assurances, including that a fueling station will not be selected as a designated emergency fueling station unless it has not less than 10 fueling positions and is located within one mile of a hurricane evacuation route.Directs the Administrator to make available to an eligible state that applies for funds 50% of the cost for the purchase and installation of transfer switches and generators for designated emergency fueling stations, and 30% of that cost of adjacent emergency fueling stations, selected by the state.</summary>
