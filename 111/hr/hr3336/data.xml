  <summary>7/24/2009--Introduced.
National Guard Technician Recruitment and Retention Act - Provides that if an individual is first employed by the National Guard as a military technician (dual status) while already a member of a reserve component, the Secretary of the military department concerned may not require the individual to repay any enlistment, reenlistment, or affiliation bonus connected with the individual's enlistment or reenlistment before such employment. Prohibits such individual from being precluded from receiving any such bonus or denied the opportunity to participate in any Department of Defense (DOD) educational loan repayment program as an additional incentive to accept and maintain reserve membership. Repeals the prohibition against overtime pay for such technicians.</summary>
