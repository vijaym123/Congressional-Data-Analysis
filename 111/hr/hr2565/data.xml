  <summary>5/21/2009--Introduced.
National Fish Habitat Conservation Act - Establishes a National Fish Habitat Board to: (1) promote, oversee, and coordinate the implementation of this Act and the existing National Fish Habitat Action Plan; (2) establish aquatic habitat conservation goals and priorities; and (3) review and recommend fish habitat conservation projects. Authorizes the Board to designate Fish Habitat Partnerships to: (1) coordinate Plan implementation at a regional level; (2) identify strategic priorities; (3) recommend habitat projects; and (4) develop and carry out fish habitat conservation projects. Establishes Partnership approval criteria, including that a Partnership: (1) include representatives of a diverse group of public and private partners focused on conservation of aquatic habitats to achieve results across jurisdictional boundaries and public and private land; and (2) is able to address issues and priorities on a nationally significant scale. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to fund, from amounts appropriated under this Act, up to 50% of the cost of approved fish habitat conservation projects on nonfederal and 100% of projects on federal land or water. Requires the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to: (1) establish the National Fish Habitat Conservation Partnership Office within the Service; and (2) develop the Office's interagency operational plan. Requires the Director, the Assistant Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Director of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to provide technical and scientific assistance to the Partnerships, the project participants, and the Board.</summary>
