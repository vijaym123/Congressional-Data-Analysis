  <summary>11/7/2009--Passed House amended.
Small Business Development Centers Modernization Act of 2009 - Amends the Small Business Act relating to small business development centers (SBDCs) (centers established through the Small Business Administration [SBA] to provide advisory, operational, and technical assistance to small businesses) to: (1) require institutions of higher education that are provided SBDC grants to be accredited; (2) require SBDC employee hirings to be at the sole discretion of an SBDC without input or approval from SBA officers or employees; (3) eliminate a matching funds requirement with respect to SBDC grant programs conducted in areas in which a disaster has occurred; and (4) allow grant distributions with respect to two or more SBDCs located in the same state only when no applicant has applied to serve the entire state. Directs the Administrator to establish SBDC grant programs for: (1) access to credit and capital; (2) procurement training and assistance; (3) green entrepreneurs training; (4) main street stabilization; and (5) small manufacturers transition (business change or reorganization) assistance. Limits grants to $300,000 per entity ($250,000 with respect to the latter two programs). Authorizes appropriations under each program for FY2010-FY2011. Prohibits funds recovered under an SBDC program through fees assessed to small business clients from being considered matching funds. Authorizes appropriations for the SBDC program for FY2010-FY2011.</summary>
