Directs the Administrator to establish SBDC grant programs for: (1) access to credit and capital; (2) procurement training and assistance; (3) green entrepreneurs training; (4) main street stabilization; and (5) small manufacturers transition (business change or reorganization) assistance. Limits grants to $300,000 per entity ($250,000 with respect to the latter two programs). Authorizes appropriations under each program for FY2010-FY2011. Prohibits funds recovered under an SBDC program through fees assessed to small business clients from being considered matching funds. Authorizes appropriations for the SBDC program for FY2010-FY2011."
