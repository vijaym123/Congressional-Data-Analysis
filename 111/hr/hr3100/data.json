Defines a \"qualified food desert business\" as a wholesale or retail business that derives at least 25% of its gross receipts from the sale of fresh fruits and vegetables. Grants certain tax benefits to a qualified food desert business, including an increased tax credit rate for rehabilitation expenditures, empowerment zone status, and tax-exempt bond financing. Amends the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 to: (1) increase to 100% the federal share of costs associated with hunger-free communities program activities in a Food Desert Zone in FY2010-FY2015; and (2) extend the authorization of appropriations for such program through FY2015. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to submit annual reports to Congress on the Food Desert Oasis Pilot Program under this Act."
