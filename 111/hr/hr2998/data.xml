  <amendments/>
  <summary>6/23/2009--Introduced.
American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to establish a combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard that requires specified retail electricity suppliers to supply an increasing percentage of their demand from a combination of energy efficiency savings and renewable energy (6% in 2012, 9.5% in 2014, 13% in 2016, 16.5% in 2018, and 20% in 2021-2039). Provides for issuing, trading, banking, retiring, and verifying renewable electricity credits. Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) certifying and permitting geologic sequestration; (2) regulating sequestration wells; (3) establishing performance standards for new coal-fired power plants; (4) developing plug-in electric drive and advanced technology vehicles and infrastructure for such vehicles; (5) assessing and supporting smart grid technology and peak demand reduction goals and related requirements; (6) planning for future transmission of electricity, including electricity grid planning that facilitates the deployment of zero-carbon energy sources; (7) expanding the definition of "renewable biomass" for purposes of the renewable fuel standard; (8) advancing or encouraging clean, renewable, alternative, innovative and/or efficient energy technology, projects, research and/or practices; (9) establishing and/or revising efficiency standards for industrial equipment, lighting, appliances, electric motors, buildings, and consumer products; (10) creating water use efficiency programs; (11) establishing rebate programs, including rebates for the replacement of manufactured homes owned by low-income families and rebates to reimburse low-income households for their estimated loss in purchasing power resulting from the Safe Climate Act provisions of this Act; (12) replacing wood or pellet stoves that do not meet specified performance standards; (13) establishing transportation-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals and standards; and (14) reducing emissions of black carbon. Safe Climate Act - Amends the Clean Air Act (CAA) to require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations to: (1) cap and reduce GHG emissions, annually, so that GHG emissions from capped sources are reduced to 97% of 2005 levels by 2012, 83% by 2020, 58% by 2030, and 17% by 2050; and (2) establish a federal GHG registry. Designates carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) from a chemical manufacturing process at an industrial stationary source, perfluorocarbons, and nitrogen trifluoride as GHGs. Requires EPA to establish specified emission allowances (tonnage limits) for: (1) each of 2012-2049; and (2) 2050 and thereafter. Provides for the establishment and distribution of compensatory allowances for the destruction and conversionary use of fluorinated gases and the nonemissive use of petroleum-based or coal-based liquid or gaseous fuel, petroleum coke, natural gas liquid, or natural gas as a feedstock. Prohibits any person from manufacturing, introducing into interstate commerce, or emitting a significant quantity of certain fluorinated gas that is generated as a byproduct during the production or use of another fluorinated gas. Phases in prohibitions against covered entities (including electricity sources, fuel producers and importers, industrial gas producers and importers, geological sequestration sites, industrial stationary sources, industrial fossil fuel-fired combustion devices, natural gas local distribution companies, nitrogen trifluoride sources, algae-based fuels, and fugitive emissions) exceeding allowable emission levels. Requires covered entities to demonstrate compliance through: (1) holding emission allowances at least as great as attributable emissions; or (2) using offset credits. Provides for trading, banking and borrowing, auctioning, selling, exchanging, transferring, holding, or retiring emission allowances. Sets forth provisions governing the disposition of emission allowances, including giving: (1) proceeds from auctions of allocations to benefit energy consumers and low income consumers and to address the impacts of climate change; and (2) free allocations to energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries, local distribution companies, merchant coal units, generators, and refineries. Requires EPA to promulgate regulations to phase down the consumption of, and regulate the production of, HFCs. Specifies consumption allowances for: (1) each of 2012-2032; and (2) 2033 and thereafter. Provides for: (1) the distribution, auction, banking, exchange, and international transfer of such allowances; and (2) the issuance of offset credits for the destruction of chlorofluorocarbons. Requires: (1) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to promulgate regulations for the establishment, operation, and oversight of markets for regulated allowances; and (2) the President to establish an interagency working group on carbon market oversight. Provides for transactions in derivatives that involve energy commodities. Gives the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) jurisdiction over the establishment, operations, and oversight of markets for regulated allowance derivatives. Amends the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act to give FERC cease-and-desist authority to prevent violations of such Acts. Global Change Research and Data Management Act of 2009 - Requires the President to establish: (1) the United States Global Change Research Program to improve understanding of climate change; and (2) a Global Change Research Information Exchange. National Climate Service Act of 2009 - Provides for the establishment of a National Climate Service within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Requires the Secretary of State to establish an International Climate Change Adaptation Program.</summary>
