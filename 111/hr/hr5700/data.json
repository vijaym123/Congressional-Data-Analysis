Nullifies any existing DOD regulation promulgated prior to enactment of this Act that restricts weapon ownership or use in violation of this Act. Requires the destruction of any record containing information about weapon ownership or use that was collected prior to enactment of this Act. Provides that nothing in this Act limits the authority of the Secretary to: (1) regulate the possession, carrying, or other use of a firearm, ammunition, or other weapon by a member of the Armed Forces or by a DOD civilian employee while engaged in official duties or while wearing the uniform of an Armed Force; or (2) create or maintain records relating to an investigation, prosecution, or adjudication of any alleged violation of law."
