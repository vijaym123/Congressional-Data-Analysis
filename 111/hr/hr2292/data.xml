  <summary>5/6/2009--Introduced.
Healthy Kids for Healthy Futures Act of 2009 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code to require a group health plan to provide coverage for appropriate preventive care for a participant's dependent child who is not more than 18 years of age. Defines "appropriate preventive care" to mean medical care that meets the most recent Bright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents. Prohibits a group health plan from imposing any cost-sharing for such preventive services. Prohibits a group health plan from taking specified actions to avoid the requirements of this Act. Applies the provisions of this Act to individual health insurance coverage. Excludes a plan from being treated as a high deductible health plan unless the requirements of this Act are met.</summary>
