  <summary>10/15/2009--Introduced.
Health and Wellness for Americans Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop an individual chronic disease prevention and wellness achievement matrix to: (1) assist individuals to lower their risks of chronic disease; (2) achieve overall reductions in the incidence of chronic disease on a national scale; and (3) lay the foundation for future policies that incentivize achievements. Requires the matrix to consist of easily measurable, demonstrable, clinical factors for: (1) achieving the recommended body mass index (or alternatively, an individual's recommended waist circumference); (2) achieving recommended lipid profile levels that make up a full lipid panel (or alternatively, the recommended ratio of high density lipoprotein [HDL] to low density lipoprotein [LDL]); (3) achieving the recommended blood pressure level; (4) completing all cancer screenings for age and gender, based on guidelines of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; (5) achieving nonsmoking status; and (6) achieving the recommended fasting blood sugar level (or if diabetic, the recommended hemoglobin A1c level).</summary>
