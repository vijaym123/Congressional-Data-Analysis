  <summary>6/22/2010--Introduced.
Oil Spill Prevention Act of 2010 - Establishes in the Department of the Interior the Minerals Management Service with the following components: (1) an Office of Leasing and Permitting, which shall perform functions relating to the leasing of areas of the outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and the issuance of activity permits under such leases that were vested in the Minerals Management Service (MMS) (or its Director) on May 19, 2010; (2) an Office of Inspection, which shall perform functions relating to vessel and facility inspection that were vested in the MMS (or its Director) on that date; and (3) an Office of Revenue, which shall perform functions relating to the collection of OCS lease revenue that were vested in the MMS (or its Director) on such date. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations that require each MMS employee to be subject to random testing for the use of a controlled substance at least twice a year. Prohibits, during the two-year period beginning on an individual's departure from MMS employment, the employment of such individual by any person conducting any activity under a lease or permit issued by MMS or subject to MMS regulation. Directs the Secretary, acting through MMS, to inspect monthly each vessel and facility used for OCS oil or gas drilling. Prohibits the Secretary from exempting any category of vessel or facility activity in OCS oil or gas drilling in waters deeper than 1,000 feet from any applicable federal requirement or restriction. Amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to repeal the liability limits applicable to a responsible party for discharge of oil from an offshore facility.</summary>
