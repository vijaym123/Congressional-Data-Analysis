Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish a standard by which each electric utility shall make interconnection service available, upon request, to any electric consumer served by the utility with respect to any facility on the consumer's premises that has a power production capacity of at least 2 megawatts. Grants FERC powers to enforce such standard. Directs FERC to establish, for the consideration of state regulatory authorities, a model standard for the interconnection of small power production facilities that have a power production capacity of between 2 and 20 megawatts.</summary>
