    "text": "Congressional Foreign Travel Reform Act of 2010 - Authorizes the House of Representatives and the Senate to obtain local currencies of foreign nations to provide a per diem allowance to a Member, officer, or employee of each chamber on official foreign travel, if the individual obtains an authorization to receive such an allowance from the appropriate specified congressional officer or committee chairman. Limits such local currency to up to the equivalent of $75 per day per person, or the authorized maximum per diem allowance for federal employees while traveling in a foreign country, whichever is greater, exclusive of the actual cost of transportation. Prohibits any Member or employee of the House from undertaking any official foreign travel unless, within 14 days before and within 14 days after such travel, the individual prepares and makes available for public inspection a specified statement containing certain travel-related information. Prohibits a vacation stopover for annual leave at any point during official foreign travel. Specifies restrictions on official foreign travel by Member and House committee employees, except travel to a military installation or to a theater of operations of the Armed Forces. Requires Members of the House and employees who undertake official foreign travel to: (1) take necessary actions to reduce travel costs; and (2) return any per diem remaining unexpended at conclusion of the travel."
