Directs the Secretary to: (1) initially appoint the individual serving as the Chief Nurse Officer of the Public Health Service as of this Act's enactment as the first National Nurse; and (2) thereafter appoint the National Nurse in accordance with Commissioned Corps Instruction CC23.4.6 (relating to Chief Professional Officer Nominations), as in effect on February 13, 2008. Grants the National Nurse the same rank and grade as the Deputy Surgeon General.Lists duties of the National Nurse, including to provide leadership and coordination of Public Health Service nursing professional affairs for the Office of the Surgeon General and other agencies of the Service, to conduct media campaigns, and to provide guidance and leadership for activities that will increase public safety and emergency preparedness. Requires the National Nurse to: (1) identify annual health priorities; (2) encourage volunteerism and strengthen the relationship between government agencies and health-related national organizations; and (3) encourage community-based, nonprofit organizations to seek grants for the purpose of education and interventions to address the annual priorities (including evaluating the activities encouraged by the National Nurse and conducted by such organizations, and disseminating information to governmental agencies, schools, and organizations interested in health promotion and improving public health through community action)."
