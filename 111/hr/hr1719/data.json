Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) to direct the appropriate state or local election official to ensure the availability of the Internet for updating voter registration information. Amends NVRA to allow a voter registration applicant to provide his or her email address on the appropriate form to receive voting information. Requires states to consider an applicant to have provided a valid voter registration form if he or she has provided all necessary information to demonstrate eligibility to vote. Allows a state to use a HAVA requirements payment to carry out the new NVRA requirements imposed by this Act."
