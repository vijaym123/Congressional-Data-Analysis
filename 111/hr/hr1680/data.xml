  <summary>3/24/2009--Introduced.
Long-Term Care Life Safety Act of 2009 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program to award grants to nursing homes, hospice facilities, assisted living facilities, residential care program facilities, board and care facilities and other appropriate facilities for the purpose of retrofitting such facilities with a professionally installed fire alarm detection system or other fire detection and prevention technology. Requires the Secretary to give priority to applicants that demonstrate a need or hardship. Allows the Secretary to consider such factors as the age and condition of the facilities, the need for facility beds in the community involved, and requirements imposed on the applicant to meet fire safety regulations under Medicare, Medicaid, other federal programs, or state or local licensing or building code standards.</summary>
