  <summary>10/21/2009--Introduced.
Offering Patients True Individualized Options Act of 2009 or the OPTION Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) eliminate restrictions on the tax deduction for medical expenses; (2) expand health care savings accounts (HSAs) and increase the maximum contribution level for such accounts; (3) allow physicians a tax credit for providing charity care; and (4) extend continuation coverage under COBRA (health insurance continuation benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985). Amends title II (Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a procedure to enroll a Medicare Part A beneficiary in the Medicare Reform Voucher Program to buy private health insurance. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to allow certified medical professionals to assess the nature and extent of an emergency room patient's illness or injury to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists. Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow the sale and purchase of health insurance policies across state lines. Sets forth requirements for and restrictions on such policies. Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2009 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide for establishment and governance of association health plans (AHPs), which are privately-sponsored group health plans that meet certain ERISA certification requirements. Establishes the Association Health Plan Fund to be used by the Secretary of Labor to make payments to an insurer to maintain coverage for a plan if there is a reasonable expectation that, without such payments, claims would not be satisfied by reason of termination of coverage. Allows a state to impose a contribution tax on an association health plan that commences operations in such state after the enactment of this Act.</summary>
