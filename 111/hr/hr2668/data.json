Requires the Plan to comply with all requirements that are applicable with respect to other health benefit plans to be offered through a National Health Insurance Exchange. (The Exchange has not yet been established.) Exempts the Plan from state insurance regulations. Treats enrollment with the Plan as satisfying any requirement under federal law for the individual to demonstrate enrollment in health insurance or benefits coverage. Sets forth provisions regarding administration of the Plan. Requires the Plan to be financially self-sustaining insofar as funds to operate the Plan shall be derived from premiums of individuals enrolled under the Plan. Makes the Plan eligible to accept subsides to the same extent as other health benefit plans offered through an Exchange. Prohibits significant changes to the Plan without public notice. Conditions a health care provider's continued participation in the Medicare program on participation in the American Trust Health Plan. Sets payment for health care providers under the Plan at 105% of the payment rates under Medicare. Requires the Administrator of the Plan to set the benefit level and the premiums."
