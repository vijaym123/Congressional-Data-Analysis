    "text": "Advance Directive Promotion Act of 2009 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require a service provider, Medicare+Choice organization, or prepaid or eligible organization to include the content of an advanced directive in a prominent part of an individual's current medical record. Requires a service provider to give effect to a valid advance directive executed outside the state in which such directive is presented to the same extent as such provider would give effect to a valid advance directive executed under the law of the state in which it is presented. Requires an initial preventative physical examination to include an end-of-life planning consultation. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to operate a clearinghouse and a 24-hour toll free telephone hotline in order to provide consumer information about advance directives, end-of-life decisionmaking, and available end-of-life and hospice care services. Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary, directly or through grants to public or nonprofit private entities, to conduct a national public education campaign to increase awareness of advance directive planning."
