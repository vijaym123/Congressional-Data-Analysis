Sets forth new requirements for granting pre-judgment probation, including that: (1) the offender did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) while committing the offense; (2) the offense did not result in death or serious injury to any person; (3) the offender was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; and (4) the offender has not been previously convicted of a crime of violence or other offense punishable by a prison term of more than one year. Increases the required period of probation from one to two years. Eliminates the requirement that an offender seeking expungement of a record of a disposition be less than 21 years old at the time of the offense."
