  <summary>7/28/2009--Introduced.
Medicare Patient Safeguards Act of 2009 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) efforts to make the Medicare program financially sustainable, including application of comparative effectiveness research, should not deprive patients of medically necessary care solely due to its cost or limit access to needed health care services due to a patient's age, gender, ethnicity, or disability status; and (2) Congress should protect patients' access to needed care by ensuring that the Administrator of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) relies on adequate clinical expertise when the Administrator proposes to narrow coverage for a product or service under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act. Establishes a process for the issuing of Medicare national coverage determinations by the Administrator. Enumerates prohibitions and conditions.</summary>
