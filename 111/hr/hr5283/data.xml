Help Haitian Adoptees Immediately to Integrate Act of 2010 or Help HAITI Act of 2010 - Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to adjust to permanent resident status an alien who: (1) was granted parole admission into the United States pursuant to the humanitarian parole policy for certain Haitian orphans announced on January 18, 2010, and suspended as to new applications on April 15, 2010; (2) is physically present in the United States; (3) is admissible as an immigrant; and (4) files an application for adjustment not later than three years after enactment of this Act. Limits the number of such adjusted aliens to 1400. Excepts such aliens from certain documentation requirements. Deems such an unmarried alien who is under the age of 18 to satisfy the requirements applicable to adopted children if: (1) the alien obtained adjustment of status; and (2) a U.S. citizen adopted the alien before, on, or after the date of the decision granting adjustment of status. Prohibits any derivative immigration benefits for the birth parent of an alien adjusted under this Act. States that the budgetary effects of this Act for the purpose of Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 compliance shall be determined by reference to the latest statement titled "Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation" for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.</summary>
