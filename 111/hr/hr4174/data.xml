Tax Relief for Business Growth and Sustainability Act of 2009 - Makes the general terminating date of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (i.e., December 31, 2010) inapplicable to its estate and gift tax provisions, except for the repeal of the carryover basis. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow a permanent increase (to $5 million) in the estate tax exclusion and a reduction in the maximum estate tax rate to 35%; (2) increase to $5 million the estate tax deduction for interests in family-owned businesses; (3) allow an estate tax deduction, up to $2 million, of the value of the principal residence of a decedent; (4) increase from 50 to 100% the exclusion from gross income of gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock held for more than 5 years; (5) eliminate gain from the sale of qualified small business stock in calculating the alternative minimum tax (AMT); and (6) repeal the requirement that federal, state, and local governmental entities withhold 3% of payments due to vendors providing goods and services to such entities.</summary>
