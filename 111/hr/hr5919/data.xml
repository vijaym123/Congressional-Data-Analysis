Authorizes the Postmaster General to declare up to 12 non-mail delivery days for the Postal Service in each fiscal year. Requires the Postmaster General to submit to the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service a report that lists when each non-mail delivery day will occur. Bars such a declaration from being effective unless the non-mail delivery day occurs on a day that is: (1) other than a Sunday; and (2) not a legal public holiday or any other day declared to be a holiday by federal statute or executive order.</summary>
