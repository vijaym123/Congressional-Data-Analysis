Requires the President, on the same day that he signs such statement, to transmit it to the Librarian of Congress who shall place it on the Thomas Web site administered by the Library with all other such statements during that Congress. Requires the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, or White House Counsel to testify before such congressional committees at the behest of any single Member of either committee to explain the meaning and justification of every presidential signing statement covered by this Act. Prohibits executive privilege from being recognized as a valid basis for refusing to appear or refusing to answer a question pertinent to the legal reasoning behind a signing statement or its legal ramifications. Bars authorization or expenditure of federal funds to implement any law accompanied by a presidential signing statement noncompliant with this Act."
