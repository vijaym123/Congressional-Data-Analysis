  <summary>3/6/2009--Introduced.
No Parole for Sex Offenders Act - Requires a state that is receiving funds for certain law enforcement assistance programs under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to put into effect laws and policies that prohibit parole for any individual convicted of a crime against a minor and any sexually violent predator. Grants states three years to implement such laws and policies (with one additional two-year extension for states making good faith efforts at implementation). Renders any state that does not implement such laws and policies within the required period ineligible for 10% of funding for its law enforcement assistance programs.</summary>
