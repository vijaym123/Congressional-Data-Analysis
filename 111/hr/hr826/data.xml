Cluster-Based Economy Enhancement Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to a state or local government, an institution of higher education, or a nonprofit economic development organization to: (1) assess the potential for the development or enhancement of business clusters (geographic concentrations of business entities that are in competing, complementary, or interdependent firms and industries, that do business with one another, and that have common needs for talent, technology, and infrastructure); (2) establish cluster development programs in regions determined by the Secretary to qualify for a grant or which have been designated by the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 as areas in which regional development commissions have been established; and (3) promote cluster development programs in such regions and support the staff who operate such programs. Limits: (1) the federal share of the cost of projects carried out using funds authorized by this Act to 50%; and (2) the portion of the non-federal share of project costs that may be provided through in-kind contributions to 50%.</summary>
