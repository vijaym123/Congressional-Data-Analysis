Revokes a specified Executive Order only insofar as it affects the lands identified for conveyance. Reverts conveyed lands to the United States if the Secretary determines that the land, or any part of such land, is sold or attempted to be sold, or that it or any part of it is used for non-National Guard or non-national defense purposes. Requires any such determination to be made in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Governor of Utah and on the record after an opportunity for comment. Requires the state, with respect to any part of the land conveyed that the Secretary determines is subject to reversion, and if the Secretary also determines that the part contains hazardous materials, to pay the United States the fair market value of that part of the conveyed land. Bars the application of the reversionary interest to that part of the land."
