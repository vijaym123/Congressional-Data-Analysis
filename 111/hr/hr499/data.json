Excludes specified factors, including a subsidy's effect, from the administering authority's consideration when determining whether a countervailable subsidy exists with respect to merchandise imported from nonmarket economy countries. Authorizes the use of alternative methodologies in determining whether a subsidy is countervailable with respect to the People's Republic of China (PRC). Deems subsidies provided predominantly or disportionately by the PRC to a state-owned enterprise as specific to that enterprise. Prohibits the administering authority from considering requests for market economy treatment at the individual business enterprise level in an antidumping duty proceeding involving a nonmarket economy country. Requires congressional approval for revocation of nonmarket economy country determinations made by the administering authority."
