  <summary>9/29/2010--Introduced.
Statistical Teaching, Aptitude, and Training Act of 2010 or STAT Act of 2010 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to award formula grants to states and, through them, competitive subgrants to eligible partnerships to: (1) establish or enhance teacher training in statistics education; and (2) develop more rigorous statistics education curricula that are aligned with challenging state academic content and achievement standards in statistics, and integrate statistics in the teaching of other courses. Defines an "eligible partnership" as a partnership between a local educational agency (LEA) and one or more of the following: (1) an institution of higher education (IHE); (2) another LEA; (3) a public elementary or secondary school or schools; or (4) a government statistical agency experienced in improving the quality of statistics teachers. Requires partnership activities to be consistent with a statistical literacy plan that each state is required to develop and have approved by the Secretary of Education before receiving its formula grant. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to states that lack the resources to develop an adequate plan so that they can do so. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to IHEs, governmental statistical agencies, or nonprofit organizations to: (1) develop model state standards and curriculum frameworks for statistics education; (2) disseminate information about proven and tested model statistics education programs that integrate statistics in other studies; (3) develop and implement new policy approaches to advancing statistics education; (4) conduct national statistics education studies; and (5) advance the widespread adoption by states and LEAs of statistics education content standards.</summary>
