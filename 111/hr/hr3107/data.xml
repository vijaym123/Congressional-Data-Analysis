Stop Nuclear Assistance to State Sponsors of Terrorism Act of 2009 - Prohibits funds from any U.S. assessed or voluntary contribution to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from being used to support assistance provided by the IAEA through its Technical Cooperation Program to any country, including North Korea, that is: (1) a state sponsor of terrorism; or (2) in breach of or noncompliance, or under investigation for breach or noncompliance, with its obligations regarding IAEA safeguards, specified treaties, or the U.N. Charter or relevant U.N. resolutions. Directs the Secretary of State to withhold specified voluntary and assessed IAEA contribution amounts. Authorizes the waiver of such withholding if: (1) the IAEA has suspended all Program assistance to such countries; or (2) the President certifies that such countries no longer pose a threat to U.S. security and allies.</summary>
