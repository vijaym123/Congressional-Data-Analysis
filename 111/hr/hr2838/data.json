    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to solicit proposals to procure a new lease for the continued operation and maintenance of Rock Creek, Langston, and East Potomac golf courses. Requires the lease to include the three golf courses in one lease agreement and mandate that the courses be operated and maintained in a manner that: (1) retains the historic nature of the courses, including an appropriate commemoration of the Langston Golf Course's historic place in African American golf history; (2) ensures that at least two of the courses maintain fees related to use that are affordable; (3) allows fees collected at one course to subsidize the maintenance and operation of one or more of the others; and (4) allows for a long-term ground lease on the three courses. Directs the Secretary to solicit the request for proposals in a manner that ensures the participation of disadvantaged business enterprises among the equity partners of the sponsors of the proposals. Makes the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 inapplicable to requests for proposals submitted and leases and agreements entered into under this Act."
