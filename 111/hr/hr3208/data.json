Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer the necessary amounts directly to the Secretary of Interior from the Treasury's general fund without further appropriation. Allows such an agency or local government, notwithstanding those requirements, to enter into a written agreement with the Secretary of the Interior, the appropriate state, and, if appropriate, any federally recognized Indian tribe or individual Indian under which all parties agree that the amounts shall be: (1) waived in whole or in part; (2) limited for an agreed upon number of years; or (3) otherwise adjusted, including the timing of any payment or payments."
