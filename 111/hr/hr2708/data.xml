Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2009 - Amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to revise requirements for health care programs and services for Indians, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations. Replaces the Urban Health Programs Branch with a Division of Urban Indian Health. Authorizes grants to urban Indian organizations for health information technology, telemedicine services development, and related infrastructure. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Indian Health Service, to provide programs of comprehensive behavioral health, prevention, and treatment. Excludes from gross income: (1) services or benefits provided or purchased by the Service; and (2) services or benefits provided by a tribe or tribal organization, directly or through insurance. Declares that these provisions are not intended as an inference to the tax treatment of governmental benefits provided by tribes to Indians. Reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to direct the Secretary to establish the Native American Health and Wellness Foundation. Expands coverage for qualified Indians in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP, formerly known as SCHIP) under title XXI of the Social Security Act (SSA), as well as under Medicare (SSA title XVIII) and Medicaid (SSA title XIX). Authorizes related payments to Indian Health Programs operating in the state.</summary>
