Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) exempt prisoners under the age of 18 from the restrictions imposed by the Prison Litigation Reform Act; and (2) expand the discretionary authority of judges in awarding relief in actions involving prison conditions. Amends the federal judicial code to: (1) exempt prisoners under the age of 18 from certain restrictions on in forma pauperis proceedings; (2) expand the number of in forma pauperis actions a prisoner may bring; and (3) revise requirements for assessing filing fees and costs against prisoners in such actions."
