  <summary>5/12/2009--Introduced.
Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), by September 30 of each calendar year 2012-2030, to distribute among the states 1.5% of the emission allowances that the Administrator has established for the year. Requires the Administrator to distribute emission allowances among the states ratably each year, based on the ratio of: (1) the carbon content of home heating oil and propane sold to consumers within each state in the preceding year for residential or commercial purposes; to (2) the carbon content of home heating oil and propane sold that year for such purposes throughout the United States. Directs each state receiving emission allowances to sell them within one year of receipt, either directly or through consignment to the Administrator for auction. Requires any emission allowances that are not sold within one year of receipt to be returned to the Administrator, who shall distribute them to the remaining states ratably in accordance with the formula. Requires states to use the proceeds from such sales exclusively for the benefit of consumers of home heating oil or propane for residential or commercial purposes, particularly: (1) cost-effective energy efficiency programs; or (2) rebates or other direct financial assistance programs for them.</summary>
