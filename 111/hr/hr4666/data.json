    "text": "Cluster-Based Economy Enhancement Act of 2010 - Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to make block grants to a state or local government, an institution of higher education, or a nonprofit economic development organization to: (1) assess the potential for the development or enhancement of business clusters (geographic concentrations of business entities that are competing, complementary, or interdependent firms and industries, that do business with one another, and that have common needs for talent, technology, and infrastructure); (2) establish cluster development programs in specified regions of the United States; and (3) promote cluster development programs in such regions and support the staff who operate such programs. Permits a recipient of grant funds to use the funds to provide assistance for startup costs, worker training, relocation costs, planning, and other projects identified by the recipient that are consistent with the purposes of this Act. Limits: (1) the federal share of the cost of projects carried out using funds authorized by this Act to 50%; and (2) the portion of the non-federal share of project costs that may be provided through in-kind contributions to 50%."
