More Books for Africa Act of 2009 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the availability of textbooks and library books is a critical component of the U.S. investment in primary, secondary, higher, and adult community education; and (2) the donation of textbooks and library books is a powerful diplomatic tool.

Provides that: (1) Program books may come only from unrestricted donations from citizens, not-for-profits, educational institutions, libraries, and private companies; (2) the Program shall encourage partnerships with faith-based organizations, community organizations, K-12 educational institutions, and private companies; (3) the Program shall encourage partnerships with African ministries of education; and (4) the Program shall encourage U.S. Ambassadors to African countries to make the establishment of libraries and donations of books to schools on behalf of the United States a priority.
