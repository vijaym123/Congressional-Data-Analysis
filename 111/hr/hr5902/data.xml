Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish: (1) a direct care workforce monitoring program; and (2) a National Advisory Council on the Direct Care Workforce. Directs the Secretary to award three-year grants to states and other eligible entities to improve the recruitment, retention, and education of the direct care workforce.</summary>
