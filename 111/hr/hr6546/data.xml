  <summary>12/17/2010--Introduced.
Transportation Infrastructure Improvements on Federal Lands Act of 2010 - Makes eligible for federal-aid highway assistance preventive maintenance activities on federal lands highways the appropriate federal land management agency demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) are a cost-effective means of extending the useful life of such a highway. Authorizes the use of Federal Lands Highway Program funds for: (1) trails used primarily for transportation; and (2) maintenance of highways, roads, parkways, and trails used primarily for transportation located on public lands, national parks, and Indian reservations, provided such maintenance will improve the asset management of such facilities. Sets the federal share of the cost of a high priority project located on public lands or an Indian reservation, or in a national park or wildlife refuge, at 100%. Makes eligible for federal-aid highway assistance any projects in the vicinity of a federally owned or managed park, refuge, or recreational area open to the general public (Paul S. Sarbanes Transit in Parks Program) that: (1) are part of an alternative transportation program in which implementation is expected to last more than one year; or (2) involve capital investment grants financing operating costs of fixed guideway projects and systems, buses and related equipment, and bus-related facilities for which capital investment grant assistance has been provided. Earmarks 60% of funds made available to the Paul S. Sarbanes Transit in Parks Program each fiscal year for qualified alternative transportation projects in national parks.</summary>
