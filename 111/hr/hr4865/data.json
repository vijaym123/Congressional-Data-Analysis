Includes within the definition of employee an employee of the United States Postal Service (USPS) or of the Postal Regulatory Commission. Authorizes a member of the uniformed services making contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund out of basic pay or inactive-duty training compensation to also contribute all or part of any payment such member receives for unused accrued leave. Authorizes the Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to promulgate regulations to implement this Act and to permit a federal employee or member of the uniformed services who is not authorized under this Act to contribute a payment for accumulated and accrued annual or vacation leave to the Thrift Savings Fund to make such contribution if the employee or member is covered by an equivalent federal employee retirement system and is authorized under law to receive such a payment and to contribute to the Fund."
