  <summary>5/19/2010--Passed House without amendment.
Honorable Stephanie Tubbs Jones College Fire Prevention Act - (Sec. 2) Directs the Secretary of Education to make competitive demonstration grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs), fraternities, and sororities for up to half the cost of installing fire sprinkler systems, or other fire suppression or prevention technologies, in student housing and dormitories owned or controlled by such entities. Gives grant priority to applicants that demonstrate the greatest financial need. Reserves the following portions of grant funds made available for each fiscal year: (1) at least 10% for historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribally controlled colleges and universities, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, and IHEs that are eligible for Institutional Aid under the Higher Education Act of 1965; and (2) at least 10% for social fraternities and sororities. Requires the Secretary to develop a plan to inform such entities that they may be eligible for such grants. Prohibits more than 2% of a grant from being used for administrative expenses. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress regarding the program within one year of this Act's enactment and annually thereafter until program completion. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY2010-FY2012. (Sec. 3) Provides that any application for assistance under this Act, any negative determination on the part of the Secretary with respect to such application, or any statement of reasons for the determination, shall not be admissible as evidence in any proceeding of any court, agency, board, or other entity (except a proceeding to enforce an agreement entered into between the Secretary and a grantee under this Act).</summary>
