Shasta-Trinity National Forest Administrative Jurisdiction Transfer Act - Transfers the administrative jurisdiction of specified federal land in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in California from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior. Transfers the administrative jurisdiction of specified federal land in California administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from the Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of Agriculture. Withdraws such land from the public domain and reserves it for administration as part of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Prohibits the land transferred to the Secretary of Agriculture that is in the Trinity Alps Wilderness from affecting the wilderness status of that land. Requires the Secretaries, with respect to the transferred lands, to identify any known sites concerning hazardous substances and to provide notice of any such sites to the head of the federal agency to which the land is being transferred.
