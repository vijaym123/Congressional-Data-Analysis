Waterfront Brownfields Revitalization Act - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to require the President to establish a grant program for reuse planning, site characterization and assessment, or remediation at waterfront brownfields sites, including the integration of activities related to the design and implementation of water quality improvements, low impact development approaches, green infrastructure, remediation and management of sediments, or flood damage prevention associated with brownfields remediation and reuse. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide training, research, and technical assistance to individuals and organizations to facilitate waterfront brownfields revitalization. Authorizes funding for brownfields revitalization for FY2010-FY2014. Requires the Administrator to establish and serve as chairperson of a task force on waterfront brownfields revitalization that shall identify: (1) funding and technical assistance resources for such revitalization; (2) barriers to and solutions for revitalization; and (3) methods to coordinate interagency revitalization efforts. Directs: (1) the Administrator to submit to specified congressional committees an annual report on the implementation of the brownfield site characterization and assessment grant program authorized by CERCLA; and (2) such committees to hold hearings each year on such report.</summary>
