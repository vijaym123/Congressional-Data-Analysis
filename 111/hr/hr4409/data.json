Requires the Secretary to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, eligible entities (i.e., entities designated as eligible to receive payment for the direct costs of medical education under provisions of the Social Security Act pertaining to payment to nonhospital providers) to: (1) plan and develop a new primary care residency training program; and (2) operate or participate in an established primary care residency training program. Directs the Secretary to give preference to entities that: (1) support teaching programs that address the health care needs of vulnerable populations; (2) are a federally qualified health center or a rural health clinic; or (3) have a demonstrated record of training a high or significantly improved percentage of health professionals who provide primary care, individuals who are from disadvantaged backgrounds, or individuals who practice in settings having the principal focus of serving underserved areas or populations experiencing health disparities."
