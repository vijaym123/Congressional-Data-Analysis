Allows the charging of a fee for admission to an exhibit if: (1) charging a fee is necessary and unavoidable; (2) the Secretary submits a statement explaining the determination to Congress; and (3) the charging of such fee does not become effective until after the expiration of a 45-day period beginning on the date the statement is submitted. Makes such prohibition non-applicable to a specified exhibition at the National Museum of Natural History. Requires the Secretary to submit a plan for eliminating the admission fee for such exhibition which shall include steps to cover the expenses incurred in carrying out the exhibition."
