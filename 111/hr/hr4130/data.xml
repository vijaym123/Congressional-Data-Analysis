  <summary>11/19/2009--Introduced.
Share the Sacrifice Act of 2010 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a temporary income-based surtax beginning after 2010 on the net income tax liability of individual taxpayers, trusts, estates, and corporations to cover federal expenditures for the war in Afghanistan. Exempts members of the Armed Forces who have received combat zone compensation, family members of such members who received a death gratuity on or after September 11, 2001, and taxpayers whose adjusted gross income does not exceed $30,000. Authorizes the President to delay the implementation of such tax for up to one year if the President determines that the U.S. economy is too weak to absorb it.</summary>
