Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as: (1) entitling a person to a cause of action for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be demonstrated to be motivated by gender; or (2) requiring a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action. Gives federal and state courts concurrent jurisdiction over actions brought pursuant to this Act. Directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to create and provide to employers materials regarding personnel policies and safety standards to assist them in avoiding liability under this Act."
