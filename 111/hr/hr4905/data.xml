  <summary>3/22/2010--Introduced.
Department of Energy Office of Science Authorization Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to carry out, through the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science, research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities in science in support of missions of DOE. Requires the Director of the Office of Science to: (1) carry out a basic energy sciences program to provide scientific foundations for new energy technologies; and (2) support construction of the National Synchrotron Light Source II and a Second Target Station at the Spallation Neutron Source. Requires the Director to carry out a grant program to provide awards for up to five years to multi-institutional collaborations or other appropriate entities for meeting energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application needs identified in: (1) the Grand Challenges report; (2) energy-related Grand Challenges for Engineering; or (3) other relevant reports identified by the Director. Requires the Director to carry out a biological, climate, and environmental systems science research program to support DOE energy and environmental missions. Provides for a biological systems science subprogram and a climate and environmental sciences research subprogram. Directs the Secretary to develop a comprehensive plan of federally supported research and development activities to support energy and environmental missions of DOE and to accelerate the growth of a synthetic biology industry in the United States. Directs the Secretary to carry out an inertial fusion energy research and technology development program. Requires the Director to carry out: (1) an advanced scientific computing research program; (2) a fusion energy sciences research program; (3) a high energy physics program; (4) a nuclear physics research program; and (5) a program for improving infrastructure at Office of Science laboratories. Requires the Secretary to submit specified reports. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015 to the Secretary for activities of the Office of Science for (1) basic science energy sciences; (2) biological and environmental research; and (3) advanced scientific computing research.</summary>
