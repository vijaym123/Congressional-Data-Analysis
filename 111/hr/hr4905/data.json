Requires the Director of the Office of Science to: (1) carry out a basic energy sciences program to provide scientific foundations for new energy technologies; and (2) support construction of the National Synchrotron Light Source II and a Second Target Station at the Spallation Neutron Source. Requires the Director to carry out a grant program to provide awards for up to five years to multi-institutional collaborations or other appropriate entities for meeting energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application needs identified in: (1) the Grand Challenges report; (2) energy-related Grand Challenges for Engineering; or (3) other relevant reports identified by the Director. Requires the Director to carry out a biological, climate, and environmental systems science research program to support DOE energy and environmental missions. Provides for a biological systems science subprogram and a climate and environmental sciences research subprogram. Directs the Secretary to develop a comprehensive plan of federally supported research and development activities to support energy and environmental missions of DOE and to accelerate the growth of a synthetic biology industry in the United States. Directs the Secretary to carry out an inertial fusion energy research and technology development program. Requires the Director to carry out: (1) an advanced scientific computing research program; (2) a fusion energy sciences research program; (3) a high energy physics program; (4) a nuclear physics research program; and (5) a program for improving infrastructure at Office of Science laboratories. Requires the Secretary to submit specified reports. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015 to the Secretary for activities of the Office of Science for (1) basic science energy sciences; (2) biological and environmental research; and (3) advanced scientific computing research."
