  <summary>2/2/2010--Introduced.
Cancer Screening Coverage Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to require a group health plan to provide coverage for certain types of cancer screening. Includes under such coverage mammograms, clinical breast examinations, pap tests and pelvic examinations, colorectal screening procedures, and prostate screening tests, at specified intervals and through specified procedures for certain age groups in appropriate genders. Prohibits related eligibility discrimination, monetary incentives to individuals, and penalties or incentives to providers. Requires such plans and issuers to provide certain disclosures to participants and beneficiaries, including regarding covered benefits, cost sharing, and participating providers. Applies the requirements of this Act to coverage offered in the individual market and under the federal employees health benefits plan. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to modify coverage requirements under this Act to incorporate new scientific and technological advances, practice pattern changes, or other updated medical practices regarding cancer screening.</summary>
