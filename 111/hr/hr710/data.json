Requires each public pension plan with a mutual ownership interest in a capital infusion fund to be authorized by state law to establish, or participate in the formation of, a wholly owned mutual fund or a limited liability corporation, in the case of joint ownership with other public pension plans. Caps the maximum amount of investments by such such a capital infusion fund at $50 billion. Restricts eligible investments to those in the preferred stock of a qualifying financial institution under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA)."
