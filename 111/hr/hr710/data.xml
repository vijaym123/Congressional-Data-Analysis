Public Retiree's Investment Act of 2009 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to guarantee eligible investments, or reguarantee a guarantee of eligible investments, by any public pension bank capital infusion fund mutually owned by state and local pension plans for the sole purpose of investing in preferred stocks of U.S. banking institutions. Requires each public pension plan with a mutual ownership interest in a capital infusion fund to be authorized by state law to establish, or participate in the formation of, a wholly owned mutual fund or a limited liability corporation, in the case of joint ownership with other public pension plans. Caps the maximum amount of investments by such such a capital infusion fund at $50 billion. Restricts eligible investments to those in the preferred stock of a qualifying financial institution under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA).</summary>
