Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue guidelines identifying minimum national standards to implement such right of access, including: (1) guidance on the timeliness and granularity of retail electric energy information; (2) appropriate nationally recognized open standards for data; and (3) protection of data security and electric consumer privacy. Empowers the attorney general, official, or agency of the state, as parens patriae, to bring a civil action against an electric utility in U.S. district court to compel compliance with such standards. Authorizes the court to award the costs of the action and reasonable attorney's fees to the party bringing a successful civil action to enforce the standards identified by the guidelines issued under this Act."
