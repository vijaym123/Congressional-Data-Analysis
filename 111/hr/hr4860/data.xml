  <summary>3/16/2010--Introduced.
Electric Consumer Right to Know Act or the e-KNOW Act - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to grant an electric consumer the right to access the consumer's retail electric energy information in electronic machine-readable form, in conformity with nationally recognized open standards, free of charge, and in a timely and convenient manner that provides adequate protections for information security and the consumer's privacy. Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue guidelines identifying minimum national standards to implement such right of access, including: (1) guidance on the timeliness and granularity of retail electric energy information; (2) appropriate nationally recognized open standards for data; and (3) protection of data security and electric consumer privacy. Empowers the attorney general, official, or agency of the state, as parens patriae, to bring a civil action against an electric utility in U.S. district court to compel compliance with such standards. Authorizes the court to award the costs of the action and reasonable attorney's fees to the party bringing a successful civil action to enforce the standards identified by the guidelines issued under this Act.</summary>
