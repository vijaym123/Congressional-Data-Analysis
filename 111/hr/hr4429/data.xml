  <summary>1/13/2010--Introduced.
Restoring the Social Security COLA Act - Authorizes an increase of $250 in Social Security, certain veterans, Civil Service Retirement (CSRS), and Federal Employees Retirement (FERS) benefits for one month in 2010 to compensate for the lack of a cost-of-living adjustment for that year. Rescinds the unobligated balance of the discretionary appropriations made available by division A of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in an amount determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to be required to offset the increase in spending resulting from such increase.</summary>
