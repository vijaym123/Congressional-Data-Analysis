    "text": "Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2009 - Sets forth cruise vessel security and safety requirements concerning: (1) vessel design and construction; (2) crew access to passenger staterooms; (3) log book entry and reporting of deaths, missing individuals, and alleged crimes; (4) a database of crewmembers terminated due to commission of a crime; (5) maintenance of rape kits on board; (6) crime scene investigation training and certification for vessel crewmembers; (7) video surveillance to monitor crime; and (8) posting of certain safety information. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act. Amends the Ports and Waterways Safety Act to revise the authority of the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating (Secretary) to dispatch Coast Guard personnel on vessels to deter or respond to terrorism or transportation security incidents. Authorizes use of such personnel to act as: (1) environmental observers to monitor compliance with federal laws regarding the discharge of waste into U.S. waters; and (2) public safety officers to assist vessel passengers and crew with reporting and investigation of crimes, securing of suspects, and collection of crime evidence. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the security needs of a passenger vessel depending on the number of passengers on the vessel, with recommendations for security improvements. Amends the Death on the High Seas Act to extend from 3 to 12 miles from the U.S. shore the high seas jurisdiction wherein a death by a wrongful act, neglect, or default of a person or vessel will allow the personal representative of the decedent to bring a civil action in admiralty."
