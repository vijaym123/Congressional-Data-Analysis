Authorizes such individual to substitute any of his or her accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave, family leave, or medical or sick leave for any of the 12-week period of such leave. Authorizes an employer to require an employee to certify with documentation the basis of the leave request. Declares that nothing in this Act shall require an employer to provide paid sick leave or paid medical leave in any situation in which such employer would not normally provide any such paid leave. Amends federal civil service law to entitle civilian federal employees, their same-sex spouses, or domestic partners to the same leave allowance. Provides for the substitution of accrued paid annual or sick leave for any part of the 12-week period. Authorizes the employing agency to require an employee to certify with documentation the basis of the leave request."
