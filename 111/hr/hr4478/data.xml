Kids Wish II Act - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to: (1) include child care facilities among public or private nonprofit facilities covered by such Act; (2) make a private for-profit child care facility eligible for assistance under the Act to the same extent as a private nonprofit child care facility; and (3) include child care within provisions regarding essential services, critical services, and federal assistance to individuals and households to address necessary expenses from a major disaster. Directs the President to: (1) encourage states and localities to include consideration of services and facilities for children within all phases of their disaster planning, training, and exercises; (2) take necessary actions to include the provision of services and facilities for children within national planning activities; (3) ensure that disaster plans for services and facilities for children incorporate specific measurable capabilities for shelter-in-place, evacuation, relocation, family reunification, temporary operating standards, and accommodation of children with disabilities and chronic health needs and other special needs child populations; and (4) establish a single federal disaster case management program with an emphasis on achieving tangible, positive outcomes for all children and families who are victims of a major disaster. Authorizes the President to: (1) provide mass care shelters for victims of major disasters, which shall provide a safe and secure mass care shelter environment for children; and (2) provide financial and other assistance for victims of a major disaster to ensure an expedited transition into permanent housing, especially for families with children who have disabilities or other special health, mental health, or educational needs. Directs the President to: (1) give priority to families with children in providing disaster housing assistance; and (2) develop a standardized, interoperable national evacuee tracking and family reunification system that ensures the safety and well-being of children. Requires disaster related information to be made available to individuals affected by a major disaster or emergency in formats that can be understood by children.</summary>
