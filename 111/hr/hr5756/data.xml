  <summary>9/23/2010--Passed House amended.
Training and Research for Autism Improvements Nationwide Act or the TRAIN Act of 2010 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service to provide individuals (including children and adults on the autism spectrum, families of such children and adults, health professionals, and vocational training and educational professionals) with interdisciplinary training, continuing education, technical assistance, and information for the purpose of improving services rendered to such children and adults and their families to address unmet needs related to autism spectrum disorder. Sets forth application requirements for a Center desiring to receive a grant, which shall include providing assurances that activities under the grant will be planned and designed with the participation of such individuals and their families. Authorizes the Secretary to reserve not more than 2% of the amount appropriated for this Act for a fiscal year to make a grant to a national organization with a demonstrated capacity for providing training and technical assistance, including to: (1) assist in national dissemination of information from interdisciplinary training programs; (2) compile and disseminate effective strategies and materials for the provision of training and technical assistance; (3) assist in the coordination of activities of grantees; (4) develop or enhance a web portal that will provide links to individual training initiatives and access to training modules, promising training, and technical assistance practices and other materials developed by grantees; and (5) serve as a resource for federal and state policymakers. Requires the Secretary to award multiyear grants to not more than four Centers to: (1) collaborate with minority institutions to provide services to individuals on the autism spectrum who are from racial and ethnic minority populations and their families and to conduct research and education focused on racial and ethnic minority populations, and (2) build capacity within such institutions to enable such institutions to apply to become Centers capable of providing services, research, and education. Directs the Secretary to give priority to applicants that demonstrate collaboration with minority institutions that: (1) have demonstrated capacity to meet the requirements of this Act and provide services to individuals on the autism spectrum and their families, or (2) are located in a state with one or more underserved populations.</summary>
