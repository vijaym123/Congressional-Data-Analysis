    "text": "Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish an Innovation Inspiration school grant program to make grants to eligible entities for the promotion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and for participation in robotics and STEM competitions. Specifies that the goals of such grant program are to: (1) support eligible entities in non-traditional STEM education teaching methods; (2) support participation by student teams in certain not-for-profit STEM robotics competitions; (3) foster innovation and broaden access to careers in STEM by engaging students in after-school programs; and (4) encourage collaboration between students, engineers, and professional mentors in designing, building, programming, and competing in challenges with sophisticated robots. Instructs the Director to establish: (1) a communications and outreach program publicizing the grant program; and (2) an evaluation and monitoring program for determining the efficacy of the grant program."
