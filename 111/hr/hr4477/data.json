Requires the Secretary to: (1) administer the system using existing medical surveillance systems; (2) notify a member and his or her commanding officer of a potential exposure; (3) for each member notified, collect information for purposes of the system; (4) for each member notified, annually provide a complete physical examination and related consultation and counseling; and (5) report annually to the congressional defense committees on the status of system implementation and incidences of illnesses which may have been caused by such exposure. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 to: (1) include solid waste containing plastics within the definition of \"covered waste\" for purposes of a prohibition against the disposal by the Armed Forces of covered waste in open-air burn pits during contingency operations; and (2) include in a required report concerning the use of such pits those situations in which such pits were used to dispose of waste during military exercises and operations worldwide during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on the date of enactment of this Act."
