    "text": "Small Business Innovation through Investment Act of 2010 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a new business-related tax credit for 30% of the equity investment in a small business concern. Allows a maximum credit of $500,000, but reduces such amount by so much of $250,000 that is not an investment in a manufacturing or biotechnology small business concern, a minority and women-owned small business, or a qualified HUBzone (historically underutilized business zone) small business concern. Terminates such credit after 2016. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to provide to the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) any data on the implementation and use of the equity investment in small business tax credit that is requested by the Administrator for analysis purposes. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress annually on the implementation and use of such tax credit."
