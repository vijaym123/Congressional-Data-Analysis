  <summary>3/16/2010--Introduced.
Allows a person to transfer to the Thrift Savings Fund account of any qualified member contributions previously made by such person under a qualified tuition program for which such member is the designated beneficiary. Defines "qualified member" to mean any member of the uniformed services serving on active duty or any member of the Ready Reserve in any pay status who: (1) is eligible to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan; and (2) provides any information necessary to identify or establish such member's account and to effect such transfer. Permits such a transfer for the benefit of a qualified member to be made irrespective of whether such member has otherwise elected to participate. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude any such qualified tuition program distribution to a Thrift Savings Fund from the distributee's gross income.</summary>
