Helping Homeowners in Distressed Communities Act of 2009 - Amends the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from using any amounts of homeowner assistance provided to or for any financial institution that are voluntarily returned to the Secretary. Permits the use of such amounts, however, to refinance and modify mortgages of homeowners in accordance with the Making Home Affordable Program established by the Secretary. Limits the allocation of any such returned amounts to areas disproportionately affected by home mortgage foreclosures.</summary>
