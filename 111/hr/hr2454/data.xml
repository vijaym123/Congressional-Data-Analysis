  <summary>6/26/2009--Passed House amended.
American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 - Sets forth provisions concerning clean energy, energy efficiency, reducing global warming pollution, transitioning to a clean energy economy, and providing for agriculture and forestry related offsets. Includes provisions: (1) creating a combined energy efficiency and renewable electricity standard and requiring retail electricity suppliers to meet 20% of their demand through renewable electricity and electricity savings by 2020; (2) setting a goal of, and requiring a strategic plan for, improving overall U.S. energy productivity by at least 2.5% per year by 2012 and maintaining that improvement rate through 2030; and (3) establishing a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and setting goals for reducing such emissions from covered sources by 83% of 2005 levels by 2050. (Sec. 3) Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Administrator) to report annually to Congress on whether China and India have adopted GHG emissions standards that are at least as strict as the standards under this Act. Title I: Clean Energy - Subtitle A: Combined Efficiency and Renewable Electricity Standard - (Sec. 101) Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to establish a combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard that requires each retail electric supplier that sells more than 4 million megawatt hours of electricity to consumers for purposes other than resale to supply an increasing percentage of its demand each year (6% in 2012, 9.5% in 2014, 13% in 2016, 16.5% in 2018, and 20% in 2020-2039) from a combination of electricity savings and renewable electricity.. Defines: (1) "renewable electricity" as electricity generated from a renewable energy resource or other qualifying energy resources; (2) "renewable energy resource" as wind, solar, and geothermal energy, renewable biomass, biogas and biofuels derived exclusively from renewable biomass, qualified hydropower, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy; and (3) "other qualifying energy resource" as landfill gas, wastewater treatment gas, coal mine methane used to generate electricity at or near the mine mouth, and qualified waste-to-energy. Requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in establishing regulations to implement the standard, to: (1) incorporate best practices of existing state and tribal renewable electricity programs; and (2) provide for the issuance, tracking, verification, and identification of renewable electricity credits (RECs). Requires each retail electric supplier to submit to FERC: (1) an amount of RECs and demonstrated total annual electricity savings equal to the supplier's annual combined target (the product of the specified annual percentage and the supplier's base amount of electricity sold in such year); and (2) RECs equal to at least three quarters of such target. Authorizes FERC, upon request from a state's governor, to increase the proportion of a supplier's target that may be met with electricity savings to no more than two fifths. Requires FERC to: (1) issue to each generator of renewable electricity a REC for each megawatt hour of renewable electricity generated after December 31, 2011; (2) issue three RECs for each megawatt hour of renewable electricity generated by an existing distributed renewable generation facility; and (3) review the effect of issuing three RECs and to reduce such number for any given energy source or technology to ensure that such number is no higher than is necessary to make such facilities using such source or technology cost competitive with other sources of renewable electricity generation. Provides for the issuance of RECs for qualified hydropower, electricity generated from qualified waste, and electricity generated using both a renewable energy resource and a nonrenewable resource. Authorizes: (1) the holder of a REC to sell, exchange, transfer, and bank a REC and to submit it for compliance or retirement; and (2) a REC to be submitted for the compliance year in which it was issued or for any of the three immediately subsequent compliance years. Requires FERC to prescribe standards that: (1) define and measure electricity savings from energy efficiency and energy conservation measures; and (2) require third-party verification of savings. Authorizes a retail electric supplier to use electricity savings transferred through a bilateral contract from another supplier, an owner of an electric distribution facility that is not a supplier, a state, or a third-party efficiency provider to meet compliance obligations. Requires: (1) a retail electric supplier to report to FERC on its annual electricity savings; and (2) FERC to review such reports and exclude any savings that have not been adequately demonstrated in accordance with such standards. Provides that this Act does not limit or affect the authority of a state to require a retail electric supplier to obtain authorization or approval of a contract for transfer of savings. Authorizes suppliers to submit to the state(s) in which they are located a payment of $25 (adjusted for inflation annually) in lieu of each REC or megawatt hour of demonstrated total annual electricity savings that would otherwise be due. Requires states to use such payments exclusively for: (1) deploying technologies that generate electricity from renewable energy resources; or (2) implementing cost-effective energy efficiency programs to achieve electricity savings. Authorizes a central procurement state to request and assume responsibility for compliance with such retail electric supplier requirements for electricity sold in the state. Sets forth provisions concerning enforcement and judicial review of such combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard. Terminates regulations concerning such standard on December 31, 2040. (Sec. 102) Authorizes states to set the rates for the voluntary sale of electric energy by a facility generating electric energy from renewable energy sources pursuant to a state-approved production incentive program. (Sec. 103) Requires the President to ensure that an increasing percentage (6% in 2012, 9.5% in 2014, 13% in 2016, 16.5% in 2018, and 20% in 2020) of the total amount of electricity federal agencies consume during 2012 through 2039 is renewable electricity. Authorizes the President to modify such requirement. Requires the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) to report to Congress by April 1, 2013, and annually thereafter on federal agencies' renewable electricity consumption. Authorizes a contract for the acquisition of electricity generated from a renewable energy resource for the federal government to be made for a period of no more than 20 years. Requires the Secretary, through the Federal Energy Management Program, to publish a standardized renewable energy purchase agreement that federal agencies may use to acquire renewable electricity. Subtitle B: Carbon Capture and Sequestration - (Sec. 111) Requires the EPA Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and other relevant agencies, to report to Congress on a unified and comprehensive strategy to address the key legal, regulatory and other barriers to the commercial-scale deployment of carbon capture and sequestration. (Sec. 112) Amends the Clean Air Act (CAA) to require the EPA Administrator to: (1) establish a coordinated approach to certifying and permitting geologic sequestration; (2) promulgate regulations, within two years, to protect human health and the environment by minimizing the risk of escape to the atmosphere of carbon dioxide injected for purposes of geologic sequestration; (3) report to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works every three years on geologic sequestration in the United States and in North America. Amends the Safe Water Drinking Act to require: (1) the EPA Administrator to promulgate regulations for carbon dioxide geologic sequestration wells; and (2) such regulations to include requirements for maintaining evidence of financial responsibility, including responsibility for emergency and remedial response, well plugging, site closure, and post-injection site care. (Sec. 113) Requires the EPA Administrator to establish a task force to study and report on the legal framework that applies to geologic sequestration sites for carbon dioxide. Requires the EPA Administrator to study and report on how the environmental statutes for which the EPA has responsibility would apply to carbon dioxide injection and geologic sequestration activities. (Sec. 114) Authorizes qualified industry organizations to conduct a referendum among the owners or operators of distribution utilities delivering fossil fuel-based electricity for the creation of a Carbon Storage Research Corporation to: (1) establish and administer a program to accelerate the commercial availability of carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies and methods and provide grants, contracts, and financial assistance to eligible entities; (2) collect an assessment on distribution utilities for all fossil fuel-based electricity delivered directly to retail consumers; (3) use funds derived from assessments to issue grants and contracts to support commercial-scale demonstrations of carbon capture or storage technology projects capable of advancing the technologies to commercial readiness; and (4) report to Congress, the Secretary, each state, and the public on its programs and allocations of resources. Requires the assessment to reflect the relative carbon dioxide emission rate of fossil fuel-based electricity, including coal, natural gas, and oil based electricity.
