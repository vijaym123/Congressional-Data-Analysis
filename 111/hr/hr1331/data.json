Prohibits the refinancing of liar loans, zero-down loans, or loans with equity removed. Authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) to purchase mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA [Ginnie Mae]) that are either backed by loans originated under this Act, or whole loans originated and purchased under this Act. Authorizes GNMA to hold, sell, and securitize such whole loans. Amends the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) to reduce Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds to offset costs of this Program."
