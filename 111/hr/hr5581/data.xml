  <summary>6/23/2010--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) an energy tax credit through 2016 for investment in qualified biogas property; and (2) financing of qualified biogas property with new clean renewable energy bonds. Defines "qualified biogas property" as property comprising a system which uses anaerobic digesters to convert biomas into a gas which consists of not less than 52% methane and which captures such gas for use as a fuel. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into an agreement with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to undertake a study of biogas and to submit a report to Congress on such study.</summary>
