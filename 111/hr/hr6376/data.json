Directs the Secretary of HHS to establish a process for designating therapeutic hospital outpatient services for which direct supervision may be required. Declares without force or effect in law regarding Medicare requirements for direct supervision by physicians for therapeutic hospital outpatient services a specified restatement and clarification under the final rule making changes to the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system and calendar year 2009 payment rates, which was published in the Federal Register on November 18, 2008."
