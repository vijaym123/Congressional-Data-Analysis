Preserving Foreign Criminal Assets for Forfeiture Act of 2010 - Amends federal forfeiture law regarding the enforcement of a foreign judgment to allow the U.S. government to apply for, and a U.S. district court to issue, a restraining order to preserve the availability of property located in the United States that is subject to civil or criminal forfeiture under foreign law, at any time before or after the initiation of forfeiture proceedings by a foreign nation. (Current law allows a restraining order before or after the United States files an application on behalf of a foreign nation seeking to enforce a foreign forfeiture or confiscation judgment.)</summary>
