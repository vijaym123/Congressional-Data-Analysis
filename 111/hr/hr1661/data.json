Directs the DHS Secretary to contract with the HHS Secretary to provide health examinations, consultations, and mental health counseling free of charge to each eligible individual.Requires the HHS Secretary to contract with an independent scientific organization to report to Congress on: (1) the effectiveness of actions taken to collect and maintain information on the health consequences of such exposure; (2) recommendations to improve such collection and maintenance; and (3) the most effective and prudent means of addressing medical needs of eligible individuals.Requires: (1) such health consultation and mental health counseling to provide to each eligible individual information on examination results and on developments; and (2) the Secretary to commence an epidemiological study of the immediate and long-term effects of such exposure sufficient to further understand the medical needs of eligible individuals."
