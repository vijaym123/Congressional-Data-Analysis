    "text": "Amends the Small Business Act relating to the women's business centers program to require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to: (1) disburse funds to a women's business center (center) no later than one month after its application is approved; (2) annually publish on the SBA website information on the financing of each center; (3) establish a standardized process to communicate with centers regarding program administration matters; and (4) notify each center of the opportunity for notice and comment on proposed program rules. Replaces the five-year projects for the benefit of small businesses owned and controlled by women with a three-tiered program of five-year (first tier), three-year (second tier), and three-year (third tier) projects, with each tier commencing after the previous tier is being completed. Allows the maximum award of assistance ($150,000) for first-tier projects that possess the capacity to train existing or potential business owners in the fields of green technology, clean technology, or energy efficiency. Revises matching funds requirements for all projects. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the SBA to: (1) establish center performance measures; and (2) require each center to submit an annual funding and strategies plan. Amends the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 to require the National Women's Business Council to perform studies of: (1) the impact of the 2008-2009 financial markets crisis on women-owned businesses; and (2) the use of SBA programs by women-owned businesses. Authorizes appropriations for the Council for FY2010-FY2011. Includes under criteria for the selection of project participants whether the applicant has the capacity to train existing or potential business owners in the fields of green technology, clean technology, or energy efficiency."
