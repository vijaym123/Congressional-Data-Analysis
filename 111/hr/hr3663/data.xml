  <summary>10/13/2009--Public Law.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to postpone until January 1, 2010, the effective date of the requirement that pharmacies, as suppliers of Medicare items and services (including durable medical equipment [DME]), must be accredited by an independent accreditation organization approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the application of an accreditation requirement for pharmacies to qualify for bidding in a competitive acquisition area.</summary>
