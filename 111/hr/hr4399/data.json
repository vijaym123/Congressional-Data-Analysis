Prescribes Phase I program requirements to direct the Secretary to award funds for the production and delivery of: (1) 2,000 all-electric trucks (including an additional number of Electric Vehicle Battery Packs) to the U.S. Postal Service; (2) 4,000 new electric U.S. Postal Service Long Life Vehicles, including 200 new Derivative Electric Vehicles, to replace existing U.S. Postal Service Long Life Vehicles; (3) 1,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicle powertrains and 2,000 all-electric powertrains for converting existing U.S. Postal Service Long Life Vehicles; and (4) 1,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to the U.S. Postal Service. Requires: (1) installation of 12,000 charging stations at U.S. Postal Service facilities; (2) the deployment of Smart Grid technologies, principally Vehicle-to-Grid; (3) activities to increase lithium ion battery repurposing and lithium ion battery recycling infrastructure; and (4) the development of standards and safety policies for the deployment of the Phase I vehicle test fleet. Establishes the Postal Service Sustainability Fund. Directs the Secretary, based on a Phase I performance report and on recommendations of the Inspector General of the U.S. Postal Service, to select one or more recipients for the award of funds for Phase II of the program for the production and delivery of 10,000 electric postal delivery vehicles and 12,000 charging stations. Requires the Secretary to establish a public information clearinghouse for all data collected under this Act. Requires the Secretary to give priority in the awarding of funds for Phase I and Phase II to applicants that comply with Buy America Act requirements."
