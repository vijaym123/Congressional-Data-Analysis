American Electric Vehicle Manufacturing Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a two-phased program to: (1) award funds for the manufacture, testing, and delivery of at least 20,000 electric drive U.S. Postal Service Long Life Vehicles or other road vehicles for local postal delivery; and (2) further the deployment of electric drive vehicles and the development of grid services using them, including Vehicle-to-Grid. Prescribes Phase I program requirements to direct the Secretary to award funds for the production and delivery of: (1) 2,000 all-electric trucks (including an additional number of Electric Vehicle Battery Packs) to the U.S. Postal Service; (2) 4,000 new electric U.S. Postal Service Long Life Vehicles, including 200 new Derivative Electric Vehicles, to replace existing U.S. Postal Service Long Life Vehicles; (3) 1,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicle powertrains and 2,000 all-electric powertrains for converting existing U.S. Postal Service Long Life Vehicles; and (4) 1,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to the U.S. Postal Service. Requires: (1) installation of 12,000 charging stations at U.S. Postal Service facilities; (2) the deployment of Smart Grid technologies, principally Vehicle-to-Grid; (3) activities to increase lithium ion battery repurposing and lithium ion battery recycling infrastructure; and (4) the development of standards and safety policies for the deployment of the Phase I vehicle test fleet.
