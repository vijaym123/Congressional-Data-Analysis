Extending Immunities to the Office of the High Representative and the International Civilian Office in Kosovo Act of 2010 - Amends the International Organizations Immunities Act to authorize: (1) the provisions of such Act to be extended to the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (and to its officers and employees) or the International Civilian Office in Kosovo (and to its officers and employees) in the same manner as they may be extended to a public international organization in which the United States participates pursuant to any treaty or under the authority of any Act of Congress authorizing such participation or making an appropriation for such participation; and (2) any such extension to continue to extend to the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (and to its officers and employees) or the International Civilian Office in Kosovo (and to its officers and employees) after that Office has been dissolved. Provides that the budgetary effects of this Act for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 shall be determined by reference to the latest statement titled "Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation" for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.</summary>
