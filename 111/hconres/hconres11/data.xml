  <summary>1/8/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) in emergency situations children have different needs than those of adults, and nutritional deficiencies disproportionately affect children; (2) in the current global food crisis children's nutritional needs must be a humanitarian priority; and (3) the United States and the other G8 member states should continue to monitor the global food crisis' impact on children and commit to increasing their assistance to children's needs.</summary>
