  <summary>7/29/2009--Passed House without amendment.
Recognizes the fifth anniversary of the congressional declaration of genocide in Darfur, Sudan. Expresses regret that such determination has not yielded effective action on the part of the United Nations and other nations which maintain significant influence in Sudan, including China and certain Arab League members. Urges: (1) the United States to work with other nations to support a negotiated settlement to the conflict; (2) U.N. member states to provide sufficient resources to support a fully capacitated African Union/United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID); and (3) the parties to the conflict in Darfur to cease attacks upon civilians and humanitarian and peacekeeping operations and to commit to finding a political solution in Darfur.</summary>
