    "text": "Sets forth the congressional budget for the federal government for FY2010, including the appropriate budgetary levels for FY2009, and FY2011-FY2014. Title I: Recommended Levels and Amounts - (Sec. 101) Recommends budgetary levels and amounts for FY2009-FY2014 with respect to: (1) federal revenues; (2) new budget authority; (3) budget outlays; (4) deficits (on-budget); (5) debt subject to limit; and (6) debt held by the public. (Sec. 102) Lists the appropriate levels of new budget authority and outlays for specified major functional categories for FY2009-FY2014. Title II: Reconciliation - (Sec. 201) Sets forth reconciliation instructions for the Committees on: (1) Energy and Commerce; (2) Ways and Means; and (3) Education and Labor. Authorizes the House to direct the House Clerk to add at the end of a health care reform bill or an education investment bill, subject to these reconciliation instructions, the text of another such measure as passed by the House to form a single engrossed reconciliation bill. Title III: Reserve Funds - (Sec. 301) Creates certain deficit-neutral reserve funds, subject to specified conditions, for legislation concerning: (1) health care reform; (2) college access, affordability, and completion; (3) an increase in energy independence; (4) America's veterans and servicemembers; (5) certain tax relief; (6) a 9/11 health program; (7) child nutrition; (8) structural unemployment insurance reforms; (9) child support; (10) the Affordable Housing Trust Fund; (11) home visiting for certain individuals and families; and (12) a low-income home energy assistance program (LIHEAP) trigger. (Sec. 313) Creates a reserve fund, subject to specified conditions, for legislation concerning reauthorization of surface transportation programs. (Sec. 314) Creates a current policy reserve fund, subject to specified conditions, for legislation concerning: (1) Medicare improvements; (2) middle-class tax relief; (3) Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) reform; and (4) the Estate and Gift Tax. Title IV: Budget Enforcement - (Sec. 401) Prescribes adjustments for direct spending and revenues to maintain such current policy reserves, only if certain conditions and pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements are met. Authorizes adjustments for the LIHEAP program, and prescribes other adjustments for the deposit insurance guarantee commitment (in effect as of the enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [EESA]). (Sec. 402) Authorizes or prescribes adjustments to discretionary spending limits, budgetary aggregates, and allocations for: (1) continuing disability reviews, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) redeterminations, and SSI asset verification by the Social Security Administration (SSA); (2) Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax compliance; (3) the health care fraud and abuse control program; (4) unemployment insurance improper payments reviews; and (5) a Partnership Fund for Program Integrity Innovation in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). States that new budget authority, outlays, and receipts resulting from adoption of legislation making appropriations for FY2009-FY2010 for overseas deployments and related activities, or appropriations for discretionary spending to meet emergency needs, shall not count for certain purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA). (Sec. 403) Prohibits House legislation that would require advance appropriations, except certain FY2011 or FY2012 programs, projects, activities, or accounts. (Sec. 404) Encourages all House committees to: (1) conduct rigorous oversight hearings to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in all aspects of federal spending and operations, giving particular scrutiny to issues raised by the Office of Inspector General or Comptroller General; and (2) make recommendations, based on these oversight efforts, to reduce wasteful federal spending to promote deficit reduction and long-term fiscal responsibility. (Sec. 405) Requires in the House the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on any budget resolution to include in its allocation to the House Committee on Appropriations amounts for the discretionary administrative expenses of the SSA and of the Postal Service. Title V: Policy - (Sec. 501) Declares the policy of this resolution on: (1) middle-income tax relief and revenues; and (2) defense priorities.
