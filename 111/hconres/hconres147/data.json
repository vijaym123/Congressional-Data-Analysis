Calls for: (1) the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to provide Congress with a five-year research plan for people with bleeding disorders; (2) the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to continue to improve outreach, treatment, and prevention for such disorders by facilitating an educational relationship between treatment centers, university health clinics, and undergraduate student populations; and (3) referrals of people with bleeding disorders to federally sponsored hemophilia treatment centers as critical to comprehensive treatment of such disorders. Urges: (1) physicians to screen all women presenting with menorrhagia for von Willebrand's disease; (2) patient advocate organizations and medical specialty societies to continue to collaborate on public education campaigns about bleeding disorders; and (3) physicians to screen all adolescents attending institutions of higher education for von Willebrand's disease."
