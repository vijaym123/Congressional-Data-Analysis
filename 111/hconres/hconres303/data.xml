Recognizes the growing threat that al Qaeda and its affiliates in Africa, particularly al Shabaab and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, pose to the United States and its allies. Acknowledges the cooperation of a number of governments and regional organizations in Africa to deny safehaven to al Qaeda and its affiliates and calls upon all governments to intensify their efforts toward that end. Calls upon the Administration to formulate a comprehensive strategy, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders in the U.S. government and its African partners, to confront the threat posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates in Africa and prevent the spread of violent Islamist extremism.</summary>
