Hoerig is deserving of justice; (2) the United States seeks the extradition of Claudia C. Hoerig and the full cooperation of Brazil; and (3) justice in the case of State of Ohio v. Claudia C. Hoerig is important to maintain the traditionally close cooperation and trust between the United States and Brazil, as evidenced by the fact that the United States is Brazil's number one trading partner and a major contributor of foreign aid."
