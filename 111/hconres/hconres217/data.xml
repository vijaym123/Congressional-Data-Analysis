  <summary>12/3/2009--Introduced.
Calls on the President to: (1) not enter into or extend any arms control agreement with the Russian Federation that may jeopardize the ability of the United States to ensure a credible strategic deterrent with regard to the People's Republic of China (PRC) or other countries that are deemed capable of deploying a strategic nuclear arsenal; (2) report to Congress on any plans or steps taken to enter into any bilateral arms control agreement with the Russian Federation; (3) report to Congress on the PRC's capabilities and intentions regarding the future deployment of a major strategic nuclear arsenal; and (4) refuse to enter into any strategic nuclear arms agreement with the Russian Federation or any other country that would require the United States to limit or suspend its efforts to create missile defense systems for itself and its allies. Urges the President to refrain from negotiating any follow-on agreement to START I until the Nuclear Posture Review is completed and the President, Congress, and all relevant U.S. government departments and agencies have had an opportunity to evaluate the Nuclear Posture Review.</summary>
