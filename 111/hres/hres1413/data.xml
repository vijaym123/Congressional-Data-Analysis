Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the public safety exception to the holding in Miranda v. Arizona may be interpreted to allow the admission into evidence in a criminal proceeding of responses of a person interrogated in connection with an act of terrorism who has not been administered Miranda warnings, to the extent that the interrogation of such person is carried out because of a reasonable concern that such person has information about other threats to public safety.</summary>
