Expresses sorrow at the death of Mr. Augustin Roberto "Bobby" Salcedo, an American citizen murdered while vacationing in Durango, Mexico. Supports continued cooperation between the governments of the United States and Mexico to help identify and convict Mr. Salcedo's killers. Calls upon such governments to increase cooperation to prosecute those responsible for drug-related killings of innocents in Mexico, whether they be U.S. or Mexican citizens. Reaffirms continued support for bilateral cooperation with Mexico to break the power of the Mexican drug cartels and turn the tide of violence.</summary>
