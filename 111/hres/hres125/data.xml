  <summary>3/11/2009--Passed House amended.
Calls on Brazil to discharge its duties under the Hague Convention to bring about Sean Goldman's return to his father David Goldman in the United States. Urges countries determined by the Department of State to have issues of non-compliance with the Convention to fulfill their obligations. Calls on all other nations to join the Convention and to establish procedures to address the tragedy of child abductions. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should: (1) review its diplomatic procedures and the operations available under the Convention to ensure that effective assistance is provided to Mr. Goldman and other U.S. citizens in obtaining the return of their children from Brazil and other countries; (2) take other appropriate measures to ensure that Convention partners return abducted children to the United States; (3) urge other nations to become parties to the Convention; and (4) continue to work for the return of children abducted from the United States and for parental visitation rights when return is not yet achieved.</summary>
