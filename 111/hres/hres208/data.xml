  <summary>3/4/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the "surge strategy" for Iraq has succeeded in providing security and stability to the Iraqi people, addressing the threat posed to the government of Iraq and the continued existence of a unified and independent Iraq by terrorist organizations and sectarian militias, and facilitating the opportunity by the Iraqi government to make decisions necessary for national reconciliation and governance. Recognizes the sacrifices made by the men and women of the United States and Coalition forces to secure the successes gained in Iraq. Extends gratitude to all those within U.S. military and civilian departments responsible for directing the implementation of the surge strategy, including General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker. Recognizes the importance and significance of victory in the Iraqi theater in the larger, global struggle against radical, Islamic Jihadist terrorists. Commits to working with President Obama and his administration to continue the progress made since the surge strategy was implemented.</summary>
