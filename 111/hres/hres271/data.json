Recognizes that: (1) preventative health and the management of chronic disease are essential components in decreasing the future dependence on long-term care; and (2) Medicaid and out-of-pocket financing of long-term care excludes countless persons from receiving health care service, which can lead to more costly and invasive medical interventions, and alternative payment options should be widely available and more accessible. Recognizes the need to: (1) collaborate with local, state, and federal health care entities to improve working conditions and training for home health aides; and (2) adequately fund and support existing technologies, entities, and initiatives that assist informal caregivers and help maintain and improve long-term health services for the disabled and elderly."
