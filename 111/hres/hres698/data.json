Brow or the late Major Brooks S. Gruber; (2) the fatal factor in such crash was the aircraft's lack of a Vortex Ring State (VRS) warning system; and (3) had adequate High Rate of Descent (HROD) and Vortex Ring State (VRS) developmental testing been conducted before the Operational Evaluation of April 8, 2000, and a VRS warning system had been installed, such pilots would have been able to avoid or recover from VRS."
