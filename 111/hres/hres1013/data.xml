Expresses concern about the further deterioration of security and rule of law in Guinea. Calls on China to cease its material support for the CNDD. Urges all member states of the United Nations to join the United States, the European Union (EU), the African Union (AU), and the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) to impose sanctions against the regime until constitutional order and rule of law has been restored in Guinea. Supports ECOWAS and AU efforts to resolve the political crisis in Guinea. Expresses solidarity with the people of Guinea and regret for the victims of the September 28, 2009, crackdown.</summary>
