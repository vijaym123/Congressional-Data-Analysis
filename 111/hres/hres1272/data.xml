  <summary>5/5/2010--Passed House without amendment.
Commemorates the 40th anniversary of the Kent State University shootings that occurred on May 4, 1970, by: (1) recognizing the tragedy of the shootings and the implications that the shootings have had not only on Kent State and the local community, but also on the nation and the world; and (2) applauding the development of the May 4 visitors' center as an additional primary resource to preserve and communicate the history of the shootings, its larger ethical and societal context and impact, and its enduring meaning for our democratic nation.</summary>
