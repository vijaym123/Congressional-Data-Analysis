  <summary>7/9/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that any health care bill considered by the 111th Congress should incorporate: (1) the ability to receive point-of-service health care in preventative, emergency, and rehabilitative settings in rural and urban areas, including programs to retain health care professionals and find a long-term solution for the sustainable growth rate formula that will accurately reimburse physicians for the care they provide to Medicare beneficiaries; (2) refundable tax credits for the purchase of health insurance by low-income recipients, together with tax credits for small businesses; (3) medical liability reform; (4) safe and effective health service with measurable results through health information technology; (5) incentives to encourage wellness, prevention, and smart choices involving health, care, treatment, and health insurance coverage; and (6) the ability to choose the best health care plan and options to meet individual and family needs through portable health insurance and Health Savings Accounts.</summary>
