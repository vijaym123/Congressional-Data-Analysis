Congratulates Israel for its accession to membership in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Commends the 31 nations of the OECD, as well as OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria, for recognizing Israel's economic success as well as its commitment to the principles of democratic government and market economy by unanimously electing Israel to OECD membership. Recognizes the importance of the strong role played by the United States in Israel's successful bid for accession to membership in the OECD. Calls on responsible nations to support efforts by Israel to accede to membership or enhance its participation, as the case may be, in international forums.</summary>
