  <summary>5/19/2010--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is incompatible with the U.S. Constitution, laws, and traditions; (2) the Convention would undermine presumptions of freedom and independence for U.S. families; (3) the Convention would interfere with the principles of U.S. sovereignty, independence, and self-government that preclude the propriety of adopting international law to govern domestic matters; and (4) the President should not transmit the Convention to the Senate for its advice and consent.</summary>
