  <summary>2/10/2009--Passed House without amendment.
Encourages all Americans to: (1) pause and remember the 50th Anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s visit to India; (2) commemorate Dr. King's legacy of nonviolence, a principle that he encountered during his study of India's Mahatma Gandhi, and successfully used in the struggle for civil rights and voting rights; (3) commemorate the impact that Dr. King's trip to India and his study of the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi had in shaping the Civil Rights Movement and creating the political climate necessary to pass legislation to expand civil rights and voting rights for all Americans; and (4) rededicate themselves to Dr. King's belief that "nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time" and to his goal of a free and just United States.</summary>
