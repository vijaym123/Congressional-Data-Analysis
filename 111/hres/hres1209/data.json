Calls upon the Administration to comply with the bipartisan commitment passed by Congress, and to cease and desist: (1) withdrawing the Yucca Mountain license application from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with or without prejudice; and (2) any action to move forward with terminating activities required to complete the Yucca Mountain license application, including the termination of employees supporting the project and termination of any leases housing employees. Calls upon the Administration to: (1) halt reprogramming of FY2010 funds appropriated by Congress for the Yucca Mountain license application; and (2) preserve all scientific and site-specific files and data related to Yucca Mountain in accordance with NRC document controls and quality assurance procedures."
