Requires the Member also to display on the homepage of such website a hypertext link that contains the words \"Appropriations Requests,\" \"Limited Tax Benefits,\" or \"Limited Tariff Benefits.\" Requires the Member to maintain the link for at least 90 calendar days after the last request is made during a Congress. Amends Rule XI (Procedures of Committees and Unfinished Business) to require any committee that accepts a Member's request for a congressional earmark or a limited tax or tariff benefit to maintain a public website with an earmark disclosure webpage that contains, in a downloadable and searchable format, the list of earmarks included in the Committee Report of the bill. Requires a committee to: (1) post the list on its earmark disclosure webpage; and (2) maintain such information on it for the remainder of a Congress. Amends Rule XXI (Restrictions on Certain Bills) to make it out of order to consider any legislation that carries a congressional earmark or limited tax or tariff benefit requested by a Member who does not comply with clause 18 of Rule XXIII."
