  <summary>3/17/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should take full responsibility for financing the health-care benefits earned by veterans with service-connected disabilities; (2) the purchase of supplemental health insurance by a veteran should not be grounds for reducing the federal government's obligation to such veteran; and (3) the VA should not implement policies that discourage disabled veterans from purchasing supplemental health insurance coverage for themselves and their families.</summary>
