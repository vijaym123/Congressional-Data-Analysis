  <summary>3/10/2010--Passed House amended.
Condemns the murder and mutilation of adults and children with albinism for their body parts. Supports people with albinism in East Africa who have been the victims of such attacks. Recognizes that such murder and mutilation is a gross violation of human rights. Urges governments in East Africa, particularly the governments of Tanzania and Burundi, to prevent further violence against such persons and to bring to justice those who have engaged in such reprehensible practices. Calls upon governments in East Africa, along with international organizations and other donors, including the United States, to support the education of people with albinism about the prevention of skin cancer and provide assistance toward that end. Calls upon governments in East Africa, along with international organizations, to educate East African populations about the realities of albinism in order to eliminate such discrimination and abuses. Calls upon the United States to work with the governments of East Africa, and international organizations and other donors, to eliminate violence against people with albinism.</summary>
