  <summary>3/31/2009--Passed House amended.
Recognizes the 30th anniversary of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and commends the extraordinary diplomatic achievement that the treaty exemplifies. Urges the governments of Egypt and Israel to strengthen the spirit of cooperation that emerged in 1979 as the Middle East faces new challenges. Encourages continued U.S. efforts to mitigate threats to a lasting Middle East peace. Calls for: (1) strengthening Egypt-Israel economic, diplomatic, and cultural relations; and (2) recognition of the Egypt-Israel peace treaty as a model mechanism upon which partner nations may build to overcome barriers to peace.</summary>
