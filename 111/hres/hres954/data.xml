  <summary>12/8/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the establishment of scientific protocols and a robust oversight mechanism governing an infrastructure of observing, monitoring, measuring, and verification technologies, data collection methods, and peer review standards is necessary to preclude future infringements of public trust by scientific falsification and fraud; and (2) climate change research information provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change should meet federal standards for scientific research as defined by the National Science and Technology Council and the National Academy of Sciences before being used as the basis for action by the U.S. government.</summary>
