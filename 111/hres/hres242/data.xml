Commends the Australian government for acknowledging the past injustices to its indigenous community. Regards the Australian Parliament's historic recognition of its past wrongs as an inspiration for other multiethnic nations. Remains committed to addressing the economic, educational, and health-related disparities that continue to affect some Black, indigenous, and other communities of color because of discriminatory laws that were authorized and enforced by U.S. local, state, and national governments.</summary>
