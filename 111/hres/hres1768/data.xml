  <summary>12/15/2010--Introduced.
Welcomes the release of Burmese democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Honors Aung San Suu Kyi for her work in pursuit of human rights and democracy in Burma. Calls on the United Nations and governments around the world to strengthen sanction regimes against Burma. Calls for the Administration to fully implement the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act to include financial sanctions as well as the appointment of a United States Special Coordinator for Burma. Calls for the release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Burma. Recognizes that Aung San Suu Kyi's release alone does not ensure democratic progress for the country unless accompanied by an end to crimes against humanity and genuine national reconciliation.</summary>
