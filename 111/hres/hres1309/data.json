Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) funding should be increased for basic and clinical biomedical research into IBS and other FGIDs through NIH; (2) the Director of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should take a leadership role in ensuring that new IBS treatments are developed and appropriately monitored; and (3) the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should bolster their efforts to study IBS and FGIDs and their association with war trauma."
