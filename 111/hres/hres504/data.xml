  <summary>6/4/2009--Introduced.
Congratulates the Republic of Poland on the 20th anniversary of the Polish parliamentary elections, the first free and democratic election in a Communist-bloc country. Recognizes that the June 4, 1989, election enabled Solidarity to form the first non-Communist and democratic government in eastern Europe since 1948. Commends the Polish people for the courage and commitment to freedom, human dignity, and justice which it showed in freeing itself from Communism, which greatly contributed to other peoples doing the same.</summary>
