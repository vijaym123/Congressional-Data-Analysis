States that such federal and state regulatory agencies should: (1) ensure that field examiners are not inappropriately classifying loans based on judgment about currently stressed sectors apart from the ability of the loans to show likelihood of repayment based on positive cash flows, ample amounts of collateral, and other mitigating factors; and (2) include additional temporary accommodations to assist well-managed community-based depository institutions in remaining vital sources of financial strength for their communities, while maintaining needed standards to assure the continued financial integrity of those institutions and communities."
