  <summary>7/1/2010--Passed House amended.
Congratulates the people of the 17 African nations that in 2010 are marking the 50th year of their national independence. Honors the lives of the thousands of patriots, including innocent civilians, who died, were imprisoned, or otherwise dedicated their lives to achieving African independence. Commends the socioeconomic and political progress being made by these nations while acknowledging the associated challenges that many still face. Recognizes Africa's strategic, political, economic, and humanitarian importance to the United States. Renews the commitment of the United States to help the people of sub-Saharan Africa to foster democratic rule and promote market-based economic growth and to alleviate the burden of poverty and disease that many in the region continue to face.</summary>
