Urges the government of the Republic of Malawi to address the violation of human rights in Malawi and the criminalization of conduct by consenting adults. Encourages the Secretary of State to monitor human rights abuses in Malawi that occur based on sexual orientation and encourages the release of those individuals detained solely on the basis of sexual orientation.</summary>
