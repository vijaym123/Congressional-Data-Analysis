  <summary>6/23/2010--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) state and local governments should only execute the power of eminent domain for the public good; (2) state and local governments must always justly compensate affected individuals in accordance with the Fifth Amendment; (3) eminent domain should never be used to advantage one private party over another; (4) no state or local government should construe Kelo v. City of New London (Kelo) as justification to abuse the power of eminent domain; and (5) Congress reserves the right to address, through legislation, any abuses of eminent domain by state and local governments in light of Kelo.</summary>
