  <summary>2/12/2009--Introduced.
Condemns the release from house arrest of Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, who established and operated an illicit international nuclear proliferation network. Declares that Dr. Khan should be required to give a full accounting of such network to the U.S. government, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and other responsible parties. States that Pakistan's willingness to carry out its nonproliferation commitments should be a guiding element in determining U.S. policy and assistance toward that country. Regards a failure by Pakistan to carry out such commitments as being incompatible with Pakistan's status as a major non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally of the United States.</summary>
