  <summary>6/26/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev are prisoners who have been denied basic due process rights under international law for political reasons and that new criminal charges brought against them should be withdrawn; and (2) the Russian Federation is encouraged to take these actions to support democratic principles and human rights in furtherance of a more positive U.S.-Russian relationship.</summary>
