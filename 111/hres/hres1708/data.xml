  <summary>9/29/2010--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) given the growing security threat from al Shabaab, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, every effort should be made to tackle its outside sources of support; (2) Eritrea's well-documented support for armed insurgents in Somalia, including al Shabaab, poses a significant threat to the national security interests of the United States and East African nations; and (3) the Secretary of State should designate Eritrea as a state sponsor of terrorism.</summary>
