Encourages all Americans to pay tribute to the life and works of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. through participation in community service projects on Martin Luther King Day (January 19, 2009). Recognizes the inherent value of community service and volunteerism in the creation of civil society and as a means of non-violent community progress consistent with the works of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Recognizes the benefits of the collaborative work by the many organizations that promote, facilitate, and carry out needed service projects nationwide. Encourages Members of the House of Representatives and colleagues to urge their constituents, both in congressional districts and those visiting the District of Columbia on Inauguration Day, to participate in community service projects. Acknowledges that by serving one's country, one's community, and one's neighbor our nation makes progress in civility, equality, and unity consistent with the values and life's work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</summary>
