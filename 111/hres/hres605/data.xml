  <summary>3/16/2010--Passed House amended.
Expresses sympathy to Falun Gong practitioners and their family members who have suffered persecution and even death because of adherence to their personal beliefs. Calls upon the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to: (1) cease its campaign against Falun Gong practitioners; (2) abolish the 6-10 office, an extrajudicial security apparatus given the mandate to "eradicate" Falun Gong; and (3) release Falun Gong practitioners from prisons and reeducation through labor camps, including those practitioners who are relatives of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Calls upon the President and Members of Congress to mark the 11th anniversary of Chinese official repression of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, including by meeting with Falun Gong practitioners.</summary>
