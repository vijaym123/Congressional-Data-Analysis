  <summary>9/22/2009--Passed House without amendment.
Supports the goals of a National Wild Horse and Burro Adoption Day to be held annually in coordination with the Secretary of Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture. Recognizes that creating a successful adoption model for wild horses and burros is consistent with federal law commonly known as "Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act" and beneficial to the long-term interests of the people of the United States in protecting wild horses and burros. Encourages citizens of the United States to adopt a wild horse or burro so as to own a living symbol of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West.</summary>
