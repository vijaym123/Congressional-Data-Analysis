Amends Rule XXIII (Code of Official Conduct) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner (Member), within 24 hours after requesting a congressional earmark or a limited tax or tariff benefit, to: (1) post on his or her website for the remainder of a Congress the name and address of the intended recipient, the requested congressional earmarks amount, and an explanation of the request, including the purpose, and why it is a valuable use of taxpayer funds; (2) submit electronically to the committee of subject-matter jurisdiction the webpage address where such information is posted; (3) identify each request as having been submitted to the committee of subject-matter jurisdiction; and (4) display on the homepage of such website a hypertext link that contains the words "Earmarks," "Appropriations Requests," "Limited Tax Benefits," or "Limited Tariff Benefits." Requires the Member to maintain the link for at least 30 calendar days after the last request is made during a Congress. Amends Rule XI (Procedures of Committees and Unfinished Business) to require any committee that accepts a Member's request for a congressional earmark or a limited tax or tariff benefit to maintain a public website with an earmark disclosure webpage that contains for each request certain identifying information in a downloadable, searchable, and sortable format. Requires: (1) a committee to post on its earmark disclosure webpage all requesting Members' written statements and other related information; and (2) such webpage to list the Members and link directly to their webpage addresses. Amends Rule XXI (Restrictions on Certain Bills) to make it out of order to consider any legislation that carries a congressional earmark or limited tax or tariff benefit requested by a Member who does not comply with clause 18 of Rule XXIII.</summary>
