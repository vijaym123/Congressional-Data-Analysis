  <summary>12/17/2010--Introduced.
States that the House of Representatives: (1) promotes a heightened awareness by educators and the public about the spectrum of policies and practices that lead to school pushout (students being effectively pushed out of school); (2) commits to working with states, local educational agencies, and schools to reduce or eliminate school suspensions, expulsions, arrests, corporal punishment, and placements in disciplinary alternative schools; (3) understands that proper behavior is not implicit but should be taught from an early age; (4) acknowledges that continuous teacher training and support enables teachers to give students the social skills and behaviors that improve the teaching and learning environment; (5) recognizes the need to improve the collection and use of school climate and disciplinary data; and (6) supports community collaborations and meaningful parental involvement to ensure that schools are safe, respectful, responsible, and effective teaching and learning environments.</summary>
