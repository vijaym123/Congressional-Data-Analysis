  <summary>4/20/2010--Introduced.
Disapproves of the majority Supreme Court opinion in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, because it allows the interests of corporations, both foreign and domestic, to supersede the voices of citizens in the democratic process. Encourages the House of Representatives and the Senate to work in a bipartisan manner to limit the influence of special interest groups in federal elections in light of the decision rendered by the Supreme Court in Citizens United.</summary>
