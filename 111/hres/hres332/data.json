Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) every federal agency should review its rules and policies regarding the agents of the U.S. economy and work with, rather than against, job creators to create a safe workplace in a way that will also allow the job creators to be successful; and (2) Congress should enact comprehensive legislation to remove job barriers."
