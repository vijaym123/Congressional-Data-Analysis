  <summary>4/2/2009--Introduced.
Recognizes that: (1) there are existing barriers to keeping and creating jobs in the United States; and (2) improving the strength of the U.S. economy depends upon congressional actions to remove such barriers. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) every federal agency should review its rules and policies regarding the agents of the U.S. economy and work with, rather than against, job creators to create a safe workplace in a way that will also allow the job creators to be successful; and (2) Congress should enact comprehensive legislation to remove job barriers.</summary>
