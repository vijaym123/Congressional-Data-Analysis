Expresses support for: (1) the domestic development and commercialization of biotechnology research by firms meeting small business size standards and collaborations with university-based biotechnology research facilities; and (2) the advancement of U.S.-based commercialization of point of care therapeutics and diagnostics by emerging and small business biotechnology firms for domestic and global use. Encourages: (1) the development of a national strategic framework to facilitate technological advancements in improving the commercialization processes for small business biotechnology firms; (2) the creation of incentives for small business biotechnology companies that perform basic and applied research through the development and commercialization of biotechnology products and processes and their diffusion into national and local economies; (3) the development of a comprehensive approach to describing disease populations and the production of comprehensive research programs that are current with evolving biotechnology and the unmet needs of diverse patient populations; and (4) the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a Federal Biotechnology Coordinating Council representative of small business biotechnology companies, research facilities, and federal agencies with a strategic initiative to facilitate development and preserve these small business biotechnology firms and coordinate resources and funding mechanisms."
