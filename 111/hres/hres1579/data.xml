  <summary>7/29/2010--Introduced.
Makes it out of order in the House to consider legislation reported or not reported by any committee, or any amendment or conference report, that includes a congressional earmark or limited tax benefit. Applies such prohibition only to legislation providing or authorizing discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority, or providing a federal tax deduction, credit, or exclusion in FY2011. Excludes from such prohibition any authorization of appropriations to a federal entity which is not specifically targeted to a state, locality, or congressional district. Prohibits the House Committee on Rules from reporting a rule or order that would waive such point of order.</summary>
