  <summary>5/19/2010--Passed House amended.
Recognizes: (1) National Missing Children's Day; (2) that one of the most important tools for law enforcement to use in the case of a missing child is an up-to-date, good quality photograph (and urges all parents and guardians to maintain such a photograph); and (3) the vital role of law enforcement and the criminal justice system in preventing kidnappings and the abduction of children and in locating missing children. Acknowledges that National Missing Children's Day should remind Americans not to forget the children who are still missing and not to waver in the efforts to reunite them with their families.</summary>
