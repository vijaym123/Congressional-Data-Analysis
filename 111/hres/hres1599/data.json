Condemns the violent, premeditated actions of the Insani Yardim Vakfi (IHH) (sponsors of the May 2010 Gaza-bound flotilla). Calls upon other nations to express their support for Israel's right to defend itself and condemn the IHH actions. Expresses hope that the recent flotilla incident neither derails the Israeli-Palestinian peace process nor stops efforts to confront ongoing attempts at the United Nations to delegitimize Israel. Encourages the Administration to consider whether the IHH should be placed on the list of foreign terrorist organizations and placed under a visa ban."
