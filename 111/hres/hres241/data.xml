  <summary>3/12/2009--Introduced.
Commends the International Criminal Court (ICC) for issuing an arrest warrant for President of the Republic of the Sudan Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir for crimes against humanity and war crimes. Condemns: (1) the expulsion of international aid agencies; and (2) the Sudanese government for continuing an active campaign of repression against its own people. Calls upon the international community to persist in its efforts to bring President al-Bashir to justice. Expresses the belief of the House of Representatives that a multifaceted approach is needed to end genocide and the repression of human rights in Darfur. Applauds the U.S. government's commitment to vigorous diplomacy and encourages President Barack Obama to appoint a full-time envoy to the region.</summary>
