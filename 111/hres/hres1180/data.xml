  <summary>3/12/2010--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the U.S. delegation to the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora should: (1) continue to support its proposal to move the polar bear from Appendix II of the Convention (species not necessarily threatened with extinction but may become so unless trade is closely controlled) to Appendix I (species are threatened with extinction); (2) withdraw its proposal to remove the bobcat from Appendix II; (3) continue to support its proposals to include the scalloped hammerhead, great hammerhead, smooth hammerhead, sandbar, dusky, and whitetip sharks in Appendix II; (4) support Palau and Sweden's proposals to include the spiny dogfishes and porbeagle sharks in Appendix II; (5) support Monaco's proposal to include the bluefin tuna in Appendix I; and (6) support protection of African elephants by opposing proposals to downlist them from Appendix I to Appendix II as well as one-time ivory sale proposals.</summary>
