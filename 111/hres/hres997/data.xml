  <summary>1/5/2010--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the President shall direct the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to: (1) initiate discussions with Japan immediately to identify and remedy violations of Japan's World Trade Organization (WTO) trade obligations for its discriminatory practices in not applying incentives for U.S. automotive imports under Japan's Eco-Friendly Vehicle Purchase Program (scrappage program); and (2) if no remedy is forthcoming, file complaints to initiate dispute resolution actions under the WTO. Expresses the sense of the House that: (1) any such action should include the impacts on the U.S. economy incurred by implementation of the U.S. Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save (CARS) incentives program in regards to Japanese manufactured automobiles that received subsidies; and (2) the Secretary of State should immediately take diplomatic and other measures to ensure that any extension of Japan's Eco-Friendly Vehicle Program is not discriminatory to U.S. manufactured automobile imports to Japan.</summary>
