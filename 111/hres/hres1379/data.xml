  <summary>5/19/2010--Introduced.
Urges states to enact laws that address the crime of domestic sex trafficking of minors. Encourages the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the pilot shelter for juvenile trafficking victims authorized by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005. Recognizes: (1) that the demand for commercial sex with minors is central to the problem of domestic sex trafficking and urges the Attorney General to make the arrest and prosecution of buyers a federal priority; (2) the need for standardized practices of identification and response to domestic sex trafficking of minors among law enforcement and service providers; and (3) the need for an adequate number of specialized residential facilities and services that are gender specific and trauma informed for the protection and restoration of trafficking victims.</summary>
