  <summary>3/19/2009--Introduced.
Amends Rule XXVIII (Statutory Limit on Public Debt) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to make it out of order to consider legislation changing the statutory limit on the public debt unless it is entitled "Increasing the statutory limit on the public debt." Prohibits such legislation from: (1) containing any provisions other than that changing the statutory limit on the public debt; and (2) being considered as passed unless so determined by a recorded vote. (Repeals the "Gephardt Rule" providing for mandatory adjustment of the statutory limit on the public debt to conform to a budget resolution.)</summary>
