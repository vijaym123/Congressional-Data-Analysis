  <summary>12/8/2010--Passed House amended.
Congratulates Liu Xiaobo on the award of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize and honors his courage and promotion of democratic reform in China. States that in honoring Liu Xiaobo the House of Representatives also honors those who have promoted democratic reform in China, including those who participated in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstration. Asserts that Liu Xiaobo is a political prisoner and that Liu Xia, Liu Xiaobo's supporters, and all signers of Charter 08 who have been detained or harassed are the victims of political persecution, and urges President Obama to work for their release. Calls on Chinese officials to: (1) release Liu Xiaobo from prison and to release Liu Xia, Liu Xiaobo's supporters, and all signers of Charter 08 from detention; and (2) cease censoring media and Internet reporting of the Nobel Peace Prize award to Liu Xiaobo and to cease its campaign of defamation against Liu Xiaobo. Emphasizes that violations of human rights in general, and the persecution of Liu Xiaobo, Liu Xia, Liu Xiaobo's supporters, and all signers of Charter 08 are matters of legitimate concern to other governments.</summary>
