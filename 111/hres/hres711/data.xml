  <summary>11/4/2009--Passed House amended.
Urges the government of Sri Lanka to allow freedom of movement for civilian internally displaced persons (IDPs) to leave their camps and return in safety to their homes or to live with host families or move to open transit sites. Calls on the Sri Lankan government to turn the operation of the camps over to civilian authorities and allow international agencies and independent nongovernmental organizations to assist in the care of the IDPs. Urges the government of Sri Lanka to promote justice and political reconciliation for all parties and engage in dialogue with all parties, including Tamils inside and outside Sri Lanka, on new mechanisms for devolving power, improving human rights, and increasing accountability.</summary>
