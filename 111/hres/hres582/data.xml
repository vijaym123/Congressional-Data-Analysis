  <summary>6/25/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) children and youth have a right to adequate housing; (2) there are an unacceptably large number of children and youth in the United States who experience homelessness every year, often because of the lack of affordable housing for their families; (3) projects that provide services to parents and other caretakers to prevent possible homelessness of youth in crisis should be created; and (4) programs that address the housing needs of low-income families should be implemented.</summary>
