  <summary>3/18/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the President should not formally propose a change in policy as significant as the proposal to authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to charge a veteran's private health insurance provider for hospital care and medical services provided by the VA for a service-connected disability; and (2) the VA should acknowledge its responsibility for financing the health care of veterans with service-connected disabilities and combat wounds.</summary>
