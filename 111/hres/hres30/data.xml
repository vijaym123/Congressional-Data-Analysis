  <summary>1/7/2009--Introduced.
Declares that it is the sense of the House of Representatives that, in order to continue aggressive growth in our nation's telecommunications and technology industries, the U.S. government should "Get Out of the Way and Stay Out of the Way" by: (1) promoting investment through deregulation and free-market competition; (2) reforming the Universal Service Fund and encouraging broadband deployment in rural unserved and underserved areas through public-private partnerships; (3) making additional spectrum available for commercial use through unencumbered auctions; (4) establishing a national goal of transmitting high-quality, real-time voice, data, graphics, and video at increasingly higher speeds to all people in the United States; (5) reforming our patent and trademark system to protect leading innovators' intellectual property; and (6) ensuring individual privacy without compromising market efficiencies.</summary>
