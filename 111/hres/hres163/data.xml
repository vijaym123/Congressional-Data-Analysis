  <summary>2/12/2009--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the Administrator of General Services should not proceed with any public building or facility project for which a prospectus has been submitted pursuant to provisions requiring congressional approval of an appropriation to construct, alter, or acquire any public building in excess of $1,500,000, to lease any space at an average annual rental in excess of $1,500,000 for public purposes, or to alter any building under lease by the federal government for a public purpose if the cost will exceed $ 750,000, unless the project has been approved and the project cost does not exceed the estimated maximum cost approved by more than 10%; and (2) in the case of a project that may not be subject to those requirements but that otherwise meets those funding thresholds and criteria, the Administrator should submit to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure a detailed plan of the project, including an estimate of the number of jobs the project will create, prior to taking actions in furtherance of the project.</summary>
