  <summary>3/9/2010--Passed House without amendment.
Supports the designation of National Robotics Week (NRW) as an annual event. Encourages institutions of higher education and companies which utilize robotics technology to hold open houses during NRW. Encourages science museums to organize events and demonstrations during NRW that help to educate and engage the public on the importance of robotics technology. Encourages schools, clubs, and organizations to hold open houses, organize local competitions, and demonstrate student activities related to the field of robotics technology. Encourages activities that advance the use of robotics to revolutionize the way fundamental science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts are taught in the classroom and that highlight the success that robotics competitions organized by groups such as For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) are having in inspiring students to pursue STEM-related careers. Affirms the growing importance of robotics technology and supports all other efforts to increase national awareness of it and its impact on the future of the nation.</summary>
