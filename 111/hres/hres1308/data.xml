  <summary>4/29/2010--Introduced.
Expresses support for the goals and ideals of the International Year of Biodiversity. Recognizes: (1) the importance of biodiversity to human well-being, the environment, and the ecosystems; and (2) the persistent threats that undermine biodiversity and require U.S. diligence in its participation under conservation strategies, plans, and agreements. Encourages complementary actions at the state and local levels. Reaffirms the U.S. commitment to the preservation of global biodiversity, especially through its leadership and participation under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</summary>
