  <summary>9/16/2010--Passed House amended.
Mourns the loss of life, as well as the physical damage, caused by the flooding in Pakistan and expresses condolences to the flood victims' families. Recognizes that: (1) Pakistan is a close U.S. ally and friend; and (2) an effective and accountable government in Pakistan is essential for the country's long-term recovery and stability. Supports the use of funds authorized by the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 to provide long-term recovery and rehabilitation for flood-affected areas and populations and urges a reexamination of priorities for spending such funds with a view toward ensuring that the needs of the Pakistani people are appropriately addressed in the aftermath of the disaster. Commends the relief and recovery actions by the U.S. military, the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Pakistani-American and U.S. business communities, and international and nongovernmental organizations.</summary>
