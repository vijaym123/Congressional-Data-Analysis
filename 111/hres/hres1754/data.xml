  <summary>12/7/2010--Introduced.
Amends Rule XXI (Restrictions on Certain Bills) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to make it out of order to consider any bill or joint resolution, conference report, or amendment unless it contains a statement appropriately citing the specific powers granted to Congress in the Constitution as a basis for enacting the law proposed by such measure. Allows a statement of constitutionality to cite the 9th or 10th Amendment to the Constitution to the extent that any measure limits or abolishes any federal activity, spending, or power overall. States that invoking the common defense clause, the general welfare clause, or the necessary and proper clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this Rule. Makes it out of order to consider a rule or order waiving the application of this resolution.</summary>
