Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) states and state law enforcement personnel in the course of carrying out routine duties have the inherent authority to investigate, identify, arrest, detain, or transfer to federal custody aliens in the United States for purposes of U.S. immigration law enforcement; (2) state and local governments should be supported and reimbursed by the federal government for taking actions to discourage illegal immigration; (4) state and local governments that knowingly harbor illegal immigrants should be penalized; (5) current laws governing the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws should be enforced; (6) attrition through enforcement should be U.S. policy; and (7) legislation to enhance border security and enforcement of immigration laws should be passed quickly to ease state and local government burdens and increase national security.</summary>
