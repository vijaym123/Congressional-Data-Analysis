  <summary>9/22/2009--Introduced.
Underscores the value of respectful speech while affirming that the freedoms of speech and religious exercise are integral to free societies and human dignity. Urges the Secretary of State to make every effort to defeat the passage of resolutions on the "defamation of religions" at the United Nations and other resolutions or international instruments that threaten the free and peaceful exchange of ideas, beliefs, and truth claims. Calls on the United Nations (U.N.) to abandon efforts to adopt the flawed concept of "defamation of religions." Urges U.N. member states to focus on protecting the fundamental freedom of individuals to peacefully express their religious beliefs and to avoid supporting resolutions that threaten freedom of expression.</summary>
