  <summary>9/9/2009--Passed House without amendment.
Recognizes September 11 as both a day to mourn and remember those taken from their loved ones and fellow citizens, and a day for the people of the United States to recommit to the nation and to each other. Extends once again deepest sympathies to friends, families, and loved ones of the innocent victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Honors the heroic service and sacrifices of first responders, law enforcement personnel, state and local officials, volunteers and others who aided the victims and, in doing so, risked and often sacrificed their own lives and health. Expresses gratitude to foreign leaders and citizens who have assisted and continue to assist the United States against the international scourge of terrorism. Asserts that the fight against terrorism is not a war on any nation, people, or faith. Recognizes the heroic service, actions, and sacrifices of U.S. Armed Forces and civilian personnel to defend their country against terrorists. Vows to continue to identify, intercept, and defeat terrorists. Calls on all Americans to renew their devotion to the universal ideals that make the nation great: freedom, pluralism, equality, and the rule of law.</summary>
