Reaffirms the centrality of freedom of the press to U.S. efforts to support democracy, mitigate conflict, and promote good governance. Calls on the President and the Secretary of State to: (1) improve the means by which the United States identifies and responds to threats against freedom of the press, and (2) highlight the issue of threats against freedom of the press."
