Deplores the undemocratic denial of the legitimate rights of opposition parliamentarians in Venezuela, the violence perpetrated against opposition legislators inside chambers of the National Assembly, and the growing efforts to use politically-motivated criminal charges to intimidate the country's political opposition. Commends legislators from other countries in the Americas who have declared their opposition to alleged electoral irregularities and condemned the use of violence against opposition parliamentarians in Venezuela. Urges the Department of State to work with other countries in the Americas to ensure the rule of law in Venezuela in accordance with the Inter-American Democratic Charter and to strengthen the ability of the Organization of American States (OAS) to respond to the erosion of democratic norms and institutions in member states. Calls for the United States to work with other countries in the hemisphere to actively encourage a process of dialogue between the government of Venezuela and the political opposition through the OAS so that the voices of all Venezuelans can be taken into account through their country's constitutional institutions and free and fair elections."
