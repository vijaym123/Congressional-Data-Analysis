Recognizes NATO ACT's leading role in transforming alliance forces and capabilities. Remembers the 64 years the North American Treaty Organization (NATO) has served to ensure peace and stability in Europe, and urges the United States to continue to expand its relationships with NATO. Recognizes: (1) the men and women who have served to safeguard the freedom and security of the United States and the whole of the transatlantic alliance; and (2) the outstanding partnership between the local community in Norfolk, Virginia, and NATO personnel assigned to ACT. Honors the sacrifices of U.S. personnel, NATO allies, and partners in Afghanistan. Urges all NATO members to implement the Strategic Concept and to utilize the taskings from the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago, Illinois, to address current NATO operations, future capabilities and burden-sharing issues. Calls upon the President to: (1) engage member states in a dialogue about NATO's long-term health, and encourage them to make serious efforts to protect defense budgets from further reductions; and (2) report to Congress on recommendations for a stronger NATO, with particular focus on the smaller member states. Expresses appreciation for the U.S.-NATO partnership."
