  <summary>10/4/2013--Passed Senate without amendment.
Recognizes the bravery of those Danes who participated in the 1943 rescue operations that saved the lives of 7,300 Jews who would otherwise have perished in Nazi concentration camps. Declares that the world owes a great debt to these Danes who did not turn a blind eye to the dangers that faced Jews under Nazi occupation and who continue to serve as an inspiration to others.</summary>
