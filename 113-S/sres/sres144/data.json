    "text": "Commends United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's commitment and leadership to resolving the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) and his appointment of Mary Robinson as United Nations Special Envoy to the Great Lakes. Supports the commitments agreed to by the signatories of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework and encourages them to work closely with the United Nations (U.N.), the African Union (AU), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, the Southern African Development Community, and relevant international bodies and governments to implement a comprehensive regional peace process. Urges the Framework signatories and the international community to engage with representatives of the government of DR Congo and civil society representatives engaged in the ongoing effort to convene an inclusive national forum. Welcomes: (1) the announcement by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim of funding to help DR Congo and other countries in the Great Lakes region provide better health and education services, generate more cross-border trade, and fund hydroelectricity projects; and (2) the appointment of Russ Feingold as the United States Special Envoy for the African Great Lakes region and DR Congo. Urges specific efforts to be taken, including: (1) supporting justice for victims of gender and human rights abuses, (2) ending the threat posed by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and other armed groups in the Great Lakes region, (3) expanding efforts to develop conflict-free and responsible mining, and (4) mobilizing support for electoral reforms. Calls on: (1) the President to work with DR Congo to improve accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses, (2) governments of the Great Lakes region to halt and prevent support to non-state armed groups, (3) relevant nations to increase cooperation on ending the illicit trade in conflict minerals and wildlife, (4) Framework signatories to cooperate in the prosecution of those responsible for violating international humanitarian law and for serious human rights violations, and (5) DR Congo to engage in electoral reforms and undertake security sector reform. Urges DR Congo to improve efforts to protect civilians from armed groups."
