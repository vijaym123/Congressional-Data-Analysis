  <summary>5/22/2013--Introduced.
Expresses support for the designation of November 28, 2013, as National Holoprosencephaly Awareness Day. Urges federal agencies to: (1) continue supporting research to better understand the causes of holoprosencephaly (HPE); (2) provide better counseling to families with the genetic forms of HPE; and (3) develop new ways to treat, and potentially prevent, HPE. Calls on the people of the United States, interested groups, and affected persons to promote awareness of HPE and to take an active role in the fight to end its devastating effects.</summary>
