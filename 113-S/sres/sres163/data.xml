  <summary>6/7/2013--Introduced.
States that in order to be considered credible the July 2013 parliamentary elections in Cambodia must: (1) implement the recommendations contained in the July 16, 2012, Report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Cambodia; and (2) include the full participation of all political parties leaders, specifically Sam Rainsy. Urges that any election in Cambodia that the Secretary of State determines is not credible should be deemed an illegitimate expression of the will of the Cambodian people and an impediment to Cambodia's democratic development. States that a Cambodian government formed as a result of such illegitimate elections should not be eligible for direct U.S. assistance.</summary>
