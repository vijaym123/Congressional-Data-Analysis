Declares that if cloture is invoked on a measure or matter before all first-degree amendments are disposed of: (1) any such amendment in order but not actually pending upon the expiration of post-cloture time may be offered and may be debated for up to one hour, equally divided in the usual form; and (2) any such amendment ruled non-germane on a point of order shall not fall upon that ruling, but instead remain pending and require 60 affirmative votes to be adopted. Limits post-cloture consideration to: (1) eight hours for any nomination except one to a position at level I of the Executive Schedule or to serve as a federal judge or justice appointed to hold office during good behavior, and (2) two hours for any U.S. district court nominations. Requires consideration of legislation and of nominations to be equally divided in the usual form."
