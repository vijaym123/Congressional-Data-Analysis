Recalls Senate Resolution 386, 112th Congress, which called for free and fair elections in Iran. Reaffirms the U.S. commitment to democracy, human rights, civil liberties, and the rule of law, including the universal rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association. Supports: (1) freedom, human rights, civil liberties, free elections, and rule of law in Iran; and (2) the people of Iran in their peaceful calls for a democratic government. Condemns the widespread human rights violations of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Calls on the Islamic Republic of Iran to: (1) hold free and fair elections; (2) end arbitrary detention, torture, and other forms of harassment against media professionals, human rights defenders, and opposition figures; (3) lift legislative restrictions on freedom of assembly, association, and expression; (4) allow the Internet to remain free and open; and (5) allow international election monitors to be present for the June 14, 2013, election. Urges the President, the Secretary of State, and other world leaders to: (1) support the rights and freedoms of the people of Iran, including the right to democratic self-government; (2) support policies that preserve open access to the Internet in Iran; and (3) condemn elections that are not free and fair and do not meet international standards.</summary>
