Amends the Internal Revenue Code to classify general aviation aircraft as seven-year property for purposes of the depreciation tax deduction (currently, expenses for aircraft can be deducted or expensed in the current taxable year). Defines \"general aviation aircraft\" as any aircraft (except those used primarily for emergency or emergency relief operations) not used in commercial or contract carrying of passengers or freight, but which primarily engages in the carrying of passengers."
