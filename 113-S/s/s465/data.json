Requires the budget sequester for an account in the security and non-security categories under the Balanced Budget Act for FY2013 to be implemented within each account as determined by the head of the agency with spending authority over such account. Requires: (1) the agency head to notify the Appropriations Committees of a proposed exercise of authority for implementing a sequester, and (2) the Appropriations Committees to approve any agency proposal. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to: (1) take appropriate actions in the management of current DOD multiyear contracts to minimize the effects of a sequester in carrying out such contracts; and (2) begin new programs, projects, and activities and enter into new contracts for multiyear procurements that are authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013. Allocates funding for prior year shipbuilding cost increases for the Navy."
