Makes any transferred amount available immediately for obligation and expenditure as directly appropriated budget authority. Specifies the amount to be transferred as the amount the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) determines necessary to: (1) prevent furloughs of FAA employees during FY2013; and (2) continue air traffic control towers that were operational as of January 1, 2013, under the FAA's contract tower program."
