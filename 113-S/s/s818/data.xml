  <summary>4/25/2013--Introduced.
Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (DOT), notwithstanding the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), any other provision of law, or sequestration order, to transfer for FY2013 to any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) appropriations account (such as the one for air traffic control operations) a certain amount from funds otherwise made available for discretionary grants-in-aid under the airport improvement program or any other FAA program. Makes any transferred amount available immediately for obligation and expenditure as directly appropriated budget authority. Specifies the amount to be transferred as the amount the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) determines necessary to: (1) prevent furloughs of FAA employees during FY2013; and (2) continue air traffic control towers that were operational as of January 1, 2013, under the FAA's contract tower program.</summary>
