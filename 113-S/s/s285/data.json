Authorizes coordination of the management and operations of the Preserve with the Bandelier National Monument. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to prepare a management plan for the Preserve.

Requires the Secretary to permit hunting, fishing, and trapping on land and water within the Preserve. Allows designation of zones and limited periods when hunting, fishing, or trapping shall not be permitted. Declares that nothing in this Act affects any jurisdiction or responsibility of the state of New Mexico respecting fish and wildlife in the Preserve. Directs the Secretary to undertake activities to improve the health of forest, grassland, and riparian areas within the Preserve. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with adjacent pueblos to coordinate such activities on the Preserve and adjacent pueblo land.
