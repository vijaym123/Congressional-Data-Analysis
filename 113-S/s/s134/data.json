Requires such investigation to consider whether: (1) such exposure causes children to act aggressively or causes other measurable harm to children, has a harmful effect on children already prone to aggressive behavior or on other identifiable groups of children, and causes effects distinguishable from other types of media; (2) any identified harm has a direct and long-lasting impact on a child's well-being; and (3) current or emerging characteristics of video games have a unique impact on children, considering video games' interactive nature and the personal and vivid way violence might be portrayed in such video games. Requires such agencies, in entering into any such arrangements, to request the NAS to report the results to Congress, FTC, FCC, and HSS."
