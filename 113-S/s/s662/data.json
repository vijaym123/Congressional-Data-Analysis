Requires two separate budget requests for the CBP Agency, one for commercial operations and one for noncommercial operations. Establishes in the DHS Office of Policy a Director of Trade Policy. Renames the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), in DHS, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE Agency).

Amends the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 to direct the Commissioner of the CBP Agency and the ICE Director to develop jointly every two years, and report to Congress, a joint strategic plan for improving trade facilitation and trade enforcement. Directs the Commissioner to ensure that CBP Agency partnership programs, such as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, provide trade benefits to importers or exporters that meet program requirements. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to direct the Commissioner to establish a voluntary government-private sector trade facilitation partnership program, or modify an existing one, to enhance trade facilitation and trade enforcement and provide certain trade benefits to importers that meet certain minimum requirements. Directs the Commissioner to develop and implement CBP Agency-wide Centers of Excellence and Expertise. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury and the DHS Secretary jointly to establish a Customs Operations Advisory Committee (effectively replacing the Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of the U.S. Customs Service).

Directs the DHS Secretary to establish within the ICE Agency a National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center to coordinate U.S. activities to prevent the import and export of goods that infringe intellectual property rights. Requires the Commissioner of the CBP Agency, upon suspicion that merchandise is being imported into the United States in violation of U.S. trademark or copyright infringement laws, and belief that testing of the merchandise by the owner of a trademark or a copyright would assist in determining a violation, to provide the trademark or copyright owner any information appearing on the merchandise and its packaging and labels, including any unredacted images of them. Authorizes the DHS Secretary to establish in the ICE Agency priority trade enforcement coordination centers. Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion Act of 2013 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the Commissioner, upon the filing of an allegation or a referral from another federal agency, to investigate claims of evasion of antidumping or countervailing duties (including any cash deposits or other security) with respect to covered merchandise entered into the United States. Requires the Commissioner, in the case of an affirmative determination based on substantial evidence, to: (1) suspend liquidation of unliquidated entries of covered merchandise and extend the period for liquidation of covered merchandise entered before such determination, (2) request the administering authority (Secretary of Commerce or other responsible U.S. officer) to identify the applicable antidumping or countervailing duties or cash deposit rate for such entries, (3) require the posting of cash deposits and assess duties, and (4) take appropriate additional enforcement measures.

Increases from $200 to $800 the retail value of articles that may be imported duty-free into the United States by one person on one day. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations for the entry of merchandise valued between $250 and $2,500. Amends the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013 to repeal the authority of the Commissioner to enter into reimbursable fee agreements for up to five years for the provision of CBP services, including additional services at existing and new CBP-serviced facilities (including but not limited to payment of overtime) and land border facilities."
