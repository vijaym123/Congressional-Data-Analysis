Requires the Commissioner of the CBP Agency, upon suspicion that merchandise is being imported into the United States in violation of U.S. trademark or copyright infringement laws, and belief that testing of the merchandise by the owner of a trademark or a copyright would assist in determining a violation, to provide the trademark or copyright owner any information appearing on the merchandise and its packaging and labels, including any unredacted images of them.
