Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to make the CPIEC the applicable Consumer Price Index (CPI) for computation of cost-of-lving increases in OASDI benefits for such individuals. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prescribe special rules for the determination of wages and self-employment income above the contribution and benefit base after 2013. Amends SSA title II to include surplus average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) in the determination of primary OASDI amounts."
