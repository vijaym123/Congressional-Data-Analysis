Nullifies, 60 days after this Act's enactment, the portions of the rule entitled \"Regulation to Mitigate the Misfueling of Vehicles and Engines with Gasoline Containing Greater Than Ten Volume Percent Ethanol and Modifications to the Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline Programs\" (published on July 25, 2011) to mitigate misfueling."
