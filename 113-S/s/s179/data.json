    "text": "Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2013 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit: (1) transferring two or more firearms to, or receiving two or more firearms from, a person in interstate or foreign commerce knowing or with the reasonable belief that such transfer, possession, or receipt of a firearm would violate a federal, state, or local law punishable by a prison term of more than one year; (2) making false statements regarding an actual buyer to a licensed firearm importer, dealer, or manufacturer relating to the purchase, receipt, or acquisition of two or more firearms that have moved in or affected interstate or foreign commerce; (3) directing, promoting, or facilitating such conduct; or (4) conspiring to commit such conduct. Authorizes an enhanced penalty for someone who organizes or supervises such conduct. Makes exceptions for a firearm that is lawfully acquired: (1) to be given to another person not prohibited from possessing it under federal or state law as a gift; or (2) by a court-appointed trustee, receiver, or conservator on behalf of an estate or creditor, to carry out a bequest, or in an acquisition by intestate succession. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and, if appropriate, amend the federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons convicted of offenses under this Act."
