Repeals the ATRA treatment of sequester. Makes conforming amendments to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. Title II: Agricultural Programs - Amends the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 to provide that payment acres for direct and counter-cyclical assistance shall be 0% of the base acres for crop year 2013 covered commodities and peanuts. Extends the existing conservation stewardship program acreage enrollment requirement for FY2013. Makes Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds available for FY2013 for: (1) the voluntary public access and habitat incentive program, and (2) the desert terminal lakes program. Amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to increase FY2013 amounts available for supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP, formerly the food stamp program) employment and training. Makes CCC funds available for FY2013 for: (1) the organic agriculture research and extension initiative; (2) the specialty crop research initiative; (3) the beginning farmer and rancher development program; (4) the biobased markets program; (5) biorefinery assistance; (6) the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels; (7) the biodiesel fuel education program; (8) the Rural Energy for America Program; (9) biomass research and development; (10) the biomass crop assistance program; (11) the farmers' market promotion program; (12) the national clean plant network; (13) the national organic certification cost-share program, (14) organic production and market data initiatives; (15) outreach and assistance for socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers; (16) the rural microentrepreneur assistance program; (17) livestock indemnity payments; (18) the livestock forage disaster program; (19) emergency assistance for livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish; and (20) the tree assistance program. Authorizes FY2013 appropriations for: (1) the rural microentrepreneur assistance program, and (2) value-added agricultural product market development grants. Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to reduce supplemental agricultural disaster assistance payment amounts. Amends the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 to authorize the Secretary to provide coverages based on individual yields (other than for value-loss crops) under the noninsured crop disaster assistance program equivalent to: (1) catastrophic risk protection, or (2) specified additional coverage. Makes ferns and tropical fish ineligible for program participation. Increases program service fees. Makes additional program coverage available at 50% to 65% of established yield and 100% of average market price. Reduces the premium for additional coverage by 50% for limited resource, beginning, and socially disadvantaged farmers.

Title III: Revenue Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require an individual taxpayer whose adjusted gross income exceeds $1 million to pay a minimum income tax rate of 30% of the excess of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income over the taxpayer's modified charitable contribution deduction for the taxable year (tentative fair share tax). Establishes the amount of such tax as the excess (if any) of the tentative fair share tax over the excess of: (1) the sum of the taxpayer's regular tax liability, the alternative minimum tax (AMT) amount, and the payroll tax for the taxable year; over (2) certain tax credits.
