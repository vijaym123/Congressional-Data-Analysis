  <summary>3/13/2013--Introduced.
Medication Therapy Management Empowerment Act of 2013 - Amends part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and to Congress on whether or not the expansion of the definition of targeted beneficiary, with respect to medication therapy management, would, if implemented, reduce spending under Medicare. Requires the report to include a certification of any determination by the Chief Actuary that such expansion would reduce such spending. Specifies such an expansion as targeted beneficiaries with a single chronic disease that accounts for high Medicare spending, including diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, dyslipidemia, respiratory disease (such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic lung disorders), bone disease-arthritis (such as osteoporosis or osteoarthritis), rheumatoid arthritis, and mental health (such as depression, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder). (Currently a targeted beneficiary must have multiple chronic diseases.) Requires such an expansion to take place if the report contains the certification indicated.</summary>
