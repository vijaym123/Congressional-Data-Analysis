  <summary>1/31/2013--Introduced.
Alaska Adjacent Zone Safe Oil Transport and Revenue Sharing Act - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) require oil produced from federal leases in certain Arctic waters, except in preproduction phases (including explorations), to be transported by pipeline to onshore facilities; and (2) provide for, and issue appropriate permits for, the transportation of oil from such leases in preproduction phases (including exploration) by means other than pipeline. Requires that the state of Alaska receive 37.5% of all revenues derived from all rentals, royalties, bonus bids and other sums payable to the United States from energy development in any area of the Alaska Adjacent Zone, including from all sources of renewable energy leased, developed, or produced in such Zone. Sets forth an allocation scheme under which the Secretary of the Interior is directed to pay: (1) 25% of any allocable state share directly to coastal political subdivisions, (2) 25% of any allocable state share to certain Regional Corporations, and (3) 10% of any allocable state share directly to Indian tribes. Instructs the Secretary to distribute: (1) 15% of certain federal royalty revenues into a specified land and water conservation fund to provide financial assistance to states, and (2) 7.5% of certain federal royalty revenues into direct federal deficit reduction. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax on bitumen transported into the United States.</summary>
