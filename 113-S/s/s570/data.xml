  <summary>3/14/2013--Introduced.
Clean Energy Race to the Top Act of 2013 - Establishes in the Department of Energy (DOE) a program to provide grants to eligible entities, on a competitive basis, to develop and carry out clean energy and carbon reduction measures, such as renewable electricity standards, regional or statewide climate action plans, and participation in a regional greenhouse gas reduction program. Directs the Secretary of Energy, in establishing criteria for grants, to take into account: (1) regional disparities in the ways in which energy is produced and used, and (2) the clean energy resource potential of the measures. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to decrease the tax deduction for oil related qualified production activities income of major integrated oil companies.</summary>
