    "text": "State Energy Race to the Top Initiative Act of 2013 - Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to establish a voluntary electric and thermal energy productivity challenge grant program to provide support to no more than 25 states for: (1) expanding industrial energy efficiency, combined heat and power, and waste heat-to-power utilization; (2) expanding policies and programs that will advance energy efficiency retrofits for commercial buildings, schools, hospitals, and residential buildings through expanded energy service performance contracts, zero net-energy buildings, or improved building energy efficiency codes; (3) establishing or expanding incentives in the electric utility sector to enhance demand response and energy efficiency; and (4) supporting state activities involving both facilities and vehicle fleets than can be a model for other action to promote energy efficiency. Requires a state to submit to the Secretary a revised state energy conservation plan under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act in order to receive a grant. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants to no more than six states to provide additional funds for activities to assist energy policy innovation in the states and to promote the goal of doubling electric and thermal energy productivity by January 1, 2030. Authorizes grants to be given to public power utilities, electric cooperatives, and Indian tribes. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to reduce the authorized amount of appropriations for FY2014-FY2017 for the Zero Net Energy Commercial Buildings Initiative."
