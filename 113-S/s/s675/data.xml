  <summary>4/9/2013--Introduced.
Never Contract With the Enemy Act - States that it shall be the policy of the United States that executive agencies shall not contract with the enemy or with any person or entity that provides funds received under a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement to an enemy of the United States or that otherwise supports those actively opposing the United States or coalition forces in a contingency operation. Authorizes the termination or nullification of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements valued in excess of $20,000 (currently, $100,000) with persons or entities identified as enemies of the United States. Requires the Secretary of Defense (DOD) and each senior procurement executive to use available intelligence to identify persons and entities who receive U.S. funds through contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements and who are: (1) providing such funds to an enemy or to a person or entity who is actively supporting an enemy of the United States, or (2) otherwise supporting those who are actively opposing U.S. or coalition forces in a contingency operation. Requires the Secretary and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to jointly carry out a program for providing information to senior procurement executives and commanders of the geographic combatant commands relating to persons or entities who may be providing funding under contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to enemies of the United States.</summary>
