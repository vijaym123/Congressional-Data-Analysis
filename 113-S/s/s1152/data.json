Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to assist medical schools in developing and strengthening primary care mentorship programs and cultivating leaders in primary care among its students. Requires the Secretary to award grants to medical and other health professions schools to promote priority competencies that are selected annually by the Secretary, acting through the Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care and Dentistry, in order to foster curricular innovations to improve the education and training of health care providers. Directs the Institute of Medicine to study the documentation requirements for cognitive services (evaluation and management services) required under Medicare and Medicaid and through private health insurers."
