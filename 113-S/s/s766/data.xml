  <summary>4/18/2013--Introduced.
Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to extend certain requirements for consideration as a rural area with respect to assistance for farm housing. Declares that any area classified as "rural" or a "rural area" before October 1, 1990, and determined not to be one as a result of data received from or after the 2010 decennial census, and any area deemed to be a "rural area" for purposes of the Act under any other provision of law at any time between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010, shall continue to be so classified until the receipt of data from the decennial census in the year 2020, if that area has a population of between 10,000 and 35,000 (currently, between 10,000 and 25,000), is rural in character, and has a serious lack of mortgage credit for lower and moderate-income families.</summary>
