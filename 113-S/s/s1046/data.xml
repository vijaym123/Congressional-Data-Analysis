Authorizes the Museum to participate in the selection of the Memorial's design, on more than a consultative basis, with the National Congress of American Indians. Makes the Museum and the National Congress of American Indians responsible for accepting contributions for, and paying the expenses of, establishing the Memorial. (Currently, the National Congress of American Indians is solely responsible for those duties.)</summary>
