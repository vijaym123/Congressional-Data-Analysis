    "text": "New Mexico Native American Water Settlements Technical Corrections Act - Amends the Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act to include among the uses of the Taos Pueblo Water Development Fund the reconstruction, replacement, rehabilitation, or repair of water or wastewater infrastructure. Eliminates fiscal year limits on the mandatory appropriation of funds for: (1) the Taos Pueblo Water Development Fund, and (2) grants to eligible non-Pueblo entities for mutual-benefit projects. Amends the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act to eliminate fiscal year limits on the mandatory appropriation of funds for: (1) the planning, design, and construction of a regional water system and the conduct of environmental compliance activities; and (2) the Aamodt Settlement Pueblos' Fund. Amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to authorize appropriations for the planning and design of conjunctive use wells in the San Juan River Basin, Little Colorado River Basin, and Rio Grande Basin in New Mexico. (Currently, funds are authorized for the construction or rehabilitation and operation and maintenance of those wells.) Alters the percentages of funds authorized for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project, conjunctive use wells, and San Juan River Irrigation Projects that may be made available for: (1) the survey, recovery, protection, preservation, and display of archaeological resources in the area of a Project facility or conjunctive use well; and (2) purchasing land and constructing and maintaining facilities to mitigate the loss of, and improve conditions for the propagation of, fish and wildlife."
