Captioning and Image Narration to Enhance Movie Accessibility Act or the CINEMA Act - Amends the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to declare it a discriminatory practice for any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates certain movie complexes to fail to ensure that the motion pictures are accessible to individuals with disabilities, including by making open captioning (openly displaying text on the movie screen), closed captioning (displaying text through an individual device), and video description (narrated descriptions) available for individuals who are blind, visually impaired, deaf, hard of hearing, or have other disabilities. Applies this Act to entities operating a complex of at least two movie theaters, screening rooms, or similar venues, at a single location, that are used for the exhibition of copyrighted motion pictures, if such exhibition is open to the public.</summary>
