  <summary>7/18/2013--Introduced.
Requires the President's budget submission to Congress to: (1) list each program, and its proposed funding level, that will be a one-time expense for the fiscal year for which the budget is submitted; and, in addition to the performance standards required, (2) a proposal, by budget function and agency, for reductions in spending for each of the four ensuing fiscal years. Requires the President, for each budget item being conducted in the current fiscal year, to provide: (1) the amount appropriated or otherwise made available for the item in that year, and (2) the amount of any proposed adjustment in the funding level for the item and its justification. Requires the President, if he proposes an adjustment resulting in a funding increase for a budget item, to include with the proposal the amount of the adjustment that is a result of inflation and the amount that is a result of an increase in employees' salaries or benefits. Requires the President to provide for each major program in a budget function specified in the required estimated budget outlays and proposed budget authority: (1) the amount appropriated or otherwise made available for it in the current fiscal year; and (2) a separate amount (if any) of its expected increase in the following fiscal year owing to inflation, pay increases, or benefit increases.</summary>
