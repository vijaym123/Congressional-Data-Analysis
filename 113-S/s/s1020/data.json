    "date": "2013-05-22", 
    "text": "All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013 - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to extend energy performance requirements for federal buildings for each of FY2016-FY2020 (from a 33% reduction from 2003 energy consumption level for FY2015 to a 45% reduction for FY2020). Requires agencies to report to the Secretary of Energy (DOE) on buildings that carry out energy intensive activities and that are designated by the agency for exclusion from such requirements. Requires the Secretary to review the results of the implementation of such requirements by December 31, 2016, (currently, December 31, 2013). Authorizes the Secretary to amend or set such performance requirements for each of FY2018-FY2025 by a rule that: (1) requires a cost-benefit analysis and an opportunity for public comment, (2) establishes performance levels that are technically feasible and economically justifiable, and (3) considers any energy- and water-saving measures identified in energy and water evaluations. Requires designated facility energy managers to consider using a system to manage energy use at their facilities in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization standard numbered 50001 and entitled \"Energy Management Systems.\" Establishes exemptions from energy and water evaluation requirements. Requires energy managers, as part of the web-based certification, to explain the reasons why any life-cycle cost effective measures identified in such evaluation were not implemented. Requires the Secretary to make available a report that summarizes information tracked under such certification. Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to revise the definition of \"federal building\" to include buildings altered by federal agencies, and to define \"major renovation,\" for purposes of such Act. Requires the Secretary to establish revised federal building energy efficiency performance standards after the approval of revisions of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 or the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) to meet or exceed such revisions, including requiring, unless new or renovated federal buildings are demonstrated not to be life-cycle cost effective: (1) such buildings to be designed to achieve energy consumption levels that are at least 30% below the levels established in the ASHRAE Standard or the IECC, and (2) no less than 30% of the hot water demand for each new building or building undergoing a major renovation to be met through the installation and use of solar hot water heaters. Repeals: (1) a standard on fossil fuel-generated energy use in federal buildings, and (2) a requirement for the Secretary to review federal building energy standards every five years."
