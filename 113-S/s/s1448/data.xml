  <summary>8/1/2013--Introduced.
Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation Equitable Compensation Act - Establishes the Spokane Tribe of Indians Recovery Trust Fund (Fund). Requires payments from the Fund to the Spokane Business Council in compensation for the use of tribal lands for the generation of hydropower from the Grand Coulee Dam. Requires the Council to prepare a plan for the use of those payments to promote: (1) economic development; (2) infrastructure development; (3) educational, health, recreational, and social welfare objectives of the Tribe and its members; or (4) any combination of those activities. Directs the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration to make specified settlement payments to the Tribe. Allows payments made to the Council or Tribe to be used or invested by the Council in the same manner and for the same purposes as other Spokane Tribal governmental funds. Provides that the deposit of amounts in the Fund extinguishes all monetary claims that the Tribe may have against the United States to a fair share of the annual hydropower revenues generated by the Grand Coulee Dam project for the past and continued use of the Tribe's land to produce hydropower at Grand Coulee Dam.</summary>
