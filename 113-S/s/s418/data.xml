  <summary>2/28/2013--Introduced.
Do-Not-Track Online Act of 2013 - Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to promulgate: (1) regulations that establish standards for the implementation of a mechanism by which an individual can indicate whether he or she prefers to have personal information collected by providers of online services, including by providers of mobile applications and services; and (2) rules that prohibit such providers from collecting personal information on individuals who have expressed a preference not to have such information collected. Requires such rules to allow for the collection and use of personal information, notwithstanding the expressed preference of the individual, if: (1) the information is necessary to provide a service requested by the individual so long as identifying particulars are removed or the information is deleted upon the provision of such service; or (2) the individual receives clear, conspicuous, and accurate notice on, and consents to, such collection and use. Provides for FTC and state enforcement of such rules and regulations.</summary>
