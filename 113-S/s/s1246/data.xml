  <summary>6/27/2013--Introduced.
American Jobs Matter Act of 2013 - Requires an executive agency to include the effects on employment within the United State (a jobs impact statement) in the evaluation factors that must be considered in each solicitation for competitive proposals for covered contracts. Defines a "covered contract" as a contract in excess of $1 million for the procurement of manufactured goods, goods or services listed in a required report of industrial base capabilities, or any item procured as part of a major defense acquisition program. Allows an offeror's jobs impact statement to include a guarantee that jobs created or retained in the United States will not be moved outside the United States after award of the contract unless doing so is required to provide the goods or services stipulated in the contract or is in the best interest of the federal government. Requires each agency to: (1) assess, annually, the accuracy of such a statement submitted by an offeror awarded a contract; and (2) track the number of jobs created or retained during the performance of such contract. Allows the agency, if the number of jobs created or retained falls short of agency estimates, to consider this as a factor that affects a contractor's past performance in the award of future contracts. Requires: (1) the Secretary of Defense to report annually on the frequency of use within the Department of Defense (DOD) of jobs impact statements in the evaluation of competitive proposals, and (2) revision of the Department of Defense Supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement this Act.</summary>
