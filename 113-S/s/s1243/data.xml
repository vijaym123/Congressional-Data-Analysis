States that this prohibition does not apply to: (1) any federal-aid system highway segment that will have the same number of nontoll lanes as existed before a toll is imposed, or (2) any high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane converted to a toll lane if an HOV may use the toll lane without paying a toll or the HOV lane was constructed as a temporary lane to be replaced by a toll lane.

Authorizes the president of Amtrak to waive such cap in cases where it poses a risk to the safety and operational efficiency of the Amtrak system.

(Sec. 163) Prohibits the Secretary from enforcing federal charter bus service regulations against any transit agency that during FY2008 was both initially granted a 60-day period to comply with such regulations, and then was subsequently granted an exception from them. (Sec. 164) Authorizes the Secretary, when applying project justification and local commitment criteria to a New Starts project, to consider the costs and ridership of any connected project where private parties are making significant financial contributions to the construction of the connected project.

(Sec. 201) Requires rescission of 50% of the amounts of budget authority (or, in the alternative, remittance to the Treasury of 50% of the associated cash amounts) that are recaptured from certain state-, local government-, or local housing agency-financed projects under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988. Requires such recaptured budget authority or funds, as well as any budget authority or cash recaptured and not rescinded or remitted to the Treasury, to be used by state housing finance agencies or local governments or local housing agencies with HUD-approved projects for which settlement occurred after January 1, 1992. Authorizes the Secretary of HUD (Secretary in this title), all the same, to award up to 15% of the budget authority or cash recaptured and not rescinded or remitted to the Treasury to provide project owners with incentives to refinance their projects at a lower interest rate. (Sec. 202) Prohibits the use of funds during FY2014 to investigate or prosecute under the Fair Housing Act any otherwise lawful activity engaged in by one or more persons, including the filing or maintaining of a non-frivolous legal action, that is engaged in solely to achieve or prevent action by a government official or entity, or a court of competent jurisdiction. (Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to make a grant under certain authority of the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act for any state that received an allocation in a prior fiscal year, but is not otherwise eligible for an FY2014 allocation because the areas in the state outside of qualifying metropolitan statistical areas in FY2014 do not have the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) otherwise required. Prescribes a formula for the allocation of such grants to Jersey City and Paterson, New Jersey.

Directs PHAs to comply by June 1, 2014, with such requirement, except that if a new flat rate amount for a dwelling unit will increase a family's existing rental payment by more than 35%, the new flat rental amount shall be phased in to ensure that the family's existing rental payment does not increase by more than 35% annually. States that this requirement shall not be construed to require establishment of rental amounts equal to 80% of the fair market rental in years when it falls from the prior year. (Sec. 210) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to treat as a PHA, for purposes of rental payments under the program of assisted low-income housing, a consortium of states, counties, municipalities, or other governmental entities or public bodies (or their agencies or instrumentalities) authorized to engage in or assist in the development or operation of public housing.

Authorizes the Secretary, however, to the extent that such a multifamily property is not feasible for continued payments, based on specified cost, operation, or environmental considerations, to: (1) contract, in consultation with the property's tenants, for project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties; or (2) provide other rental assistance. (Sec. 218) Revises requirements for PHA inspections of each dwelling unit for which a housing assistance payment contract is established.

(Sec. 232) Amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to revise requirements with respect to termination of tenancy by an owner of affordable housing assisted under such Act for rental. States that the mandatory 30-day notice is not required if the grounds for the termination or refusal to renew a lease involve a direct threat to the safety of the tenants or employees of the housing, or an imminent and serious threat to the property (and the termination or refusal to renew is in accordance with requirements of state or local law). Revises requirements regarding the recapture and reuse of funds set-aside for investment only in housing to be developed, sponsored, or owned by community housing development organizations.

(Sec. 236) Amends the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 to repeal the mandatory transfer to the Flexible Subsidy Fund of all uncommitted balances in the Rental Housing Assistance Fund of certain excess rental charges as of September 30, 2007, as well as any collections made during FY2008 and all subsequent fiscal years. (Sec. 237) Defines "extremely low-income families," under the program of assisted low-income housing, as very low-income families whose incomes do not exceed the higher of: (1) specified poverty guidelines updated periodically by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); or (2) 30% of the median family income for the area, with adjustments for smaller and larger families. Authorizes the Secretary to establish income ceilings higher or lower than 30% if necessary because of unusually high or low family incomes. Revises income eligibility requirements for public housing, for tenant-based section 8 assistance, and for project-based section 8 assistance to substitute "extremely low-income families" for the respective eligibility formula. (Sec. 238) Modifies funding requirements for Rental Assistance Demonstration provided in the Department of Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, 2012. (Sec. 239) Bars the use of funds in this Act provided to HUD to make a grant award unless the Secretary notifies congressional appropriations committees at least three full business days before any project, state, locality, housing authority, tribe, nonprofit organization, or other entity selected to receive a grant award is announced by HUD or its offices. (Sec. 240) Amends the Housing Act of 1959 to revise requirements for HUD assistance to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly. Requires the Secretary to establish procedures to delegate the award, review and processing of projects, selected by the Secretary in a national competition, to specified state or local housing agencies for issuance of capital advances to applicants. (Currently, the Secretary, within 30 days of award of the capital advance, is required to delegate such review and processing to such agencies.) Repeals the agencies' authority to: (1) assess a reasonable fee to be included in the capital advance amounts, and (2) recommend project rental assistance amounts in excess of those initially awarded by the Secretary. Authorizes project rental assistance for projects which identify in their applications a defined health and other supportive services program, including sources of financing and memoranda of understanding with service provision agencies and organizations. (Sec. 241) Amends the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1996 to allow national and regional organizations and consortia experienced in providing or facilitating self-help housing homeownership opportunities to use certain grants for rehabilitation of existing dwelling units.

(Sec. 242) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to prohibit, in determining the monthly tenant-based assistance payment for a family under the section 8 (voucher program), the amount allowed for tenant-paid utilities from exceeding the appropriate utility allowance for the family unit size regardless of the size of the dwelling unit leased by the family. Requires a PHA to approve a higher utility allowance, upon request, for a family including a person with disabilities if one is needed as a reasonable accommodation to make the program accessible to and usable by that family member. (Sec. 243) Revises procedures under the section 8 rental assistance program for publishing fair market rentals for an area with respect to the amount and scope of monthly assistance payments.
