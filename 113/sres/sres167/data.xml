Condemns the use of threats or force by naval, maritime security, or fishing vessels and military or civilian aircraft in the South China Sea and the East China Sea to assert disputed maritime or territorial claims. Urges that all parties in the region exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would undermine stability or complicate or escalate disputes, including refraining from inhabiting presently uninhabited islands and other features. Reaffirms U.S. support for the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China (PRC) as they seek to develop a code of conduct in the South China Sea, and urges all countries to support ASEAN in these efforts. Supports collaborative diplomatic processes by all claimants in the South China Sea for resolving outstanding maritime or territorial disputes. Encourages the deepening of U.S. efforts to develop partnerships with other countries in the region for maritime domain awareness and capacity building. Supports the continuation U.S. Armed Forces operations in the Western Pacific in support of freedom of navigation, maintenance of peace and stability, and respect for universally recognized principles of international law.</summary>
