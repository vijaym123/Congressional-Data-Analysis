  <summary>6/27/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) an action plan for addressing the needs of children living in adversity should be sanctioned by the highest level of U.S. government; and (2) federal funding that currently goes toward projects and research benefitting children in low- and middle-income countries should be coordinated among recipient federal agencies to promote permanent family care for the most vulnerable children, reduce the number of children who experience violence or exploitation, and eliminate duplication and contradictory approaches within the U.S. government.</summary>
