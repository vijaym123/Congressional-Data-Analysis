  <summary>5/23/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) all telephone service providers must appropriately complete calls to all areas of the United States regardless of the technology used by such providers; (2) no entity may unreasonably discriminate against telephone users in rural areas; and (3) the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should pursue violators of FCC rules, impose enforcement actions to discourage such uncompleted calls and unreasonable discrimination, and establish a definitive solution to discrimination against telephone users in rural areas.</summary>
