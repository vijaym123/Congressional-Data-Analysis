  <summary>4/24/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) it supports the U.S. Soldier's Creed and the Warrior Ethos, which state that "I will never leave a fallen comrade"; (2) it believes it is unacceptable to abandon the search efforts for members of the Armed Forces who are missing or captured in the line of duty; and (3) the United States, while continuing to transition leadership roles in combat operations in Afghanistan, has a responsibility to continue fulfilling the promises made to members in a missing status or captured as a result of service in Afghanistan now or in the future.</summary>
