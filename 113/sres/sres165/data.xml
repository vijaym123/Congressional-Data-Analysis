  <summary>6/25/2013--Reported to Senate amended.
Calls on: (1) the government of Ukraine to release former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko from imprisonment based on politicized charges and in light of the April 2013 European Court of Human Rights verdict, and (2) European Union (EU) members to include Ms. Tymoshenko's release as a criterion for signing an association agreement with Ukraine at the upcoming Eastern Partnership Summit in Lithuania. Expresses the Senate's concern that the politically motivated imprisonment of Ms. Tymoshenko detracts from Ukraine's otherwise strong relationship with Europe, the United States, and the community of democracies.</summary>
