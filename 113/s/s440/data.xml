  <summary>3/4/2013--Introduced.
Preparing and Reinvesting in Early Education Act of 2013 or the PRE ED Act of 2013 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to include early childhood educators in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) and Direct Loan (DL) forgiveness programs for teachers. Makes early childhood educators eligible for FFEL or DL forgiveness if they are not in default on the loan being forgiven and have: (1) been employed as a full-time early childhood educator for five consecutive complete school years or a comparable period, as determined by the Secretary of Education; and (2) obtained an associate or baccalaureate degree in early childhood education prior to that period of service. Caps at $25,000 the amount of an early childhood educator's FFEL or DL that may be forgiven. Includes early childhood educators with associate degrees in early childhood development, early child education, or a related field in the program providing FFEL forgiveness for service in areas of national need. (Currently, early childhood educators are required to have completed a baccalaureate or advanced degree in such a field to qualify for participation in that program.)</summary>
