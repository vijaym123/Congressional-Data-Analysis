Makes early childhood educators eligible for FFEL or DL forgiveness if they are not in default on the loan being forgiven and have: (1) been employed as a full-time early childhood educator for five consecutive complete school years or a comparable period, as determined by the Secretary of Education; and (2) obtained an associate or baccalaureate degree in early childhood education prior to that period of service. Caps at $25,000 the amount of an early childhood educator's FFEL or DL that may be forgiven. Includes early childhood educators with associate degrees in early childhood development, early child education, or a related field in the program providing FFEL forgiveness for service in areas of national need. (Currently, early childhood educators are required to have completed a baccalaureate or advanced degree in such a field to qualify for participation in that program.)"
