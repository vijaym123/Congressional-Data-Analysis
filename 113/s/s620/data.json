Prohibits funds from being appropriated or otherwise made available from the U.S. Treasury for the pay of the Director of OMB, Deputy Director of OMB, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB during any noncompliant period determined by the IG. Bars such individuals from receiving any retroactive pay for any such period."
