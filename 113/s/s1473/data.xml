Long-Term Care Insurance Consumer Right-to-Know Act of 2013 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to issue a white paper with its results from the following activities: (1) review and describe disclosure requirements for long-term care insurance policies under the long-term care insurance model regulation and model act promulgated by NAIC (as adopted as of October 2000 and December 2006), (2) review and describe disclosure requirements for long-term care insurance policies under state laws, (3) review and describe differences in long-term care services among states and develop a standardized definition of long-term care services, and (4) identify and describe key issues to consider in the development of a proposed model form for marketing long-term care insurance policies. Directs the Secretary to request NAIC to: (1) establish a Working Group to develop and issue a model disclosure form for marketing long-term care insurance policies, and (2) amend the model regulation and model act to require the use of such form. Requires the Secretaries of the Treasury and HHS to promulgate regulations requiring issuers of a qualified long-term care insurance contract under certain tax-qualified or Medicaid Partnership policies to use the model form for marketing such contracts. Directs each state to require any issuer of a long-term care insurance policy to use the model form for marketing a policy.</summary>
