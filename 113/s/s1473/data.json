Directs the Secretary to request NAIC to: (1) establish a Working Group to develop and issue a model disclosure form for marketing long-term care insurance policies, and (2) amend the model regulation and model act to require the use of such form. Requires the Secretaries of the Treasury and HHS to promulgate regulations requiring issuers of a qualified long-term care insurance contract under certain tax-qualified or Medicaid Partnership policies to use the model form for marketing such contracts. Directs each state to require any issuer of a long-term care insurance policy to use the model form for marketing a policy."
