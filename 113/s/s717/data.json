Directs the Secretary, in determining whether to award a grant, to apply performance-based criteria, which shall give priority to applications based on: (1) the cost-effectiveness of the energy-efficiency improvement; and (2) an effective plan for evaluation, measurement, and verification of energy savings. Limits each grant award to: (1) an amount equal to 50% of the energy-efficiency improvement, and (2) $200,000. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY2014-FY2017. Requires the Secretary to use amounts otherwise made available for the Building Technologies Program to carry out such pilot program."
