Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to make recommendations regarding the appropriate roles and responsibilities of federal entities with respect to programs and activities related to FASD. Requires the Secretary of Education to direct the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services to conduct training on FASD surveillance and disseminate best practices in the education and support of children with FASD.
