  <summary>1/22/2013--Introduced.
Rebuild America Act - Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should: create jobs and support businesses while improving the nation's global competitiveness by modernizing and strengthening our national infrastructure; invest resources in transportation corridors that promote commerce and reduce congestion; update and enhance the U.S. network of rail, dams, and ports; develop innovative financing mechanisms for infrastructure to leverage federal funds with private sector partners; invest in critical infrastructure to reduce energy waste and bolster investment in clean energy jobs and industries; invest in clean energy technologies that help free the United States from its dependence on oil; eliminate wasteful tax subsidies that promote pollution and fail to reduce our reliance on foreign oil; spur innovation by facilitating the development of new cutting-edge broadband internet technology and improving internet access for all Americans; modernize, renovate, and repair elementary and secondary school buildings in order to support improved educational outcomes; invest in the nation's crumbling water infrastructure to protect public health and reduce pollution; upgrade and repair the nation's system of flood protection infrastructure to protect public safety; and invest in U.S. infrastructure to address vulnerabilities to natural disasters and the impacts of extreme weather.</summary>
