  <summary>2/28/2013--Introduced.
Arctic Deep Water Ports Enhancement Act of 2013 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to enter into partnership agreements with certain developers to: (1) plan, survey, design, construct, maintain, or operate Arctic deepwater ports; (2) provide technical assistance for such activities; and (3) receive funds from federal, nonfederal, and private entities, including developers of Arctic deepwater ports that have an agreement with the Secretary for such activity. Defines "Arctic deepwater port" as any port facility, in a water depth of at least 30 feet, located in waters: (1) north of 60 degrees latitude north and west of 162 degrees longitude west, or (2) north of 63 degrees latitude north. Defines "developer" as any private entity, state, municipal, or borough government, Alaska Native corporation created by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, or the western Alaska community development quota program created by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act that is seeking to develop an Arctic deepwater port. Establishes the Arctic Port Infrastructure Development Fund within the U.S. Treasury. Permits the Secretary, within a 30-year period and subject to specified limitations, to issue federal guarantee instruments with respect to loans and other debt obligations for such ports. Requires the loan or debt obligation guaranteed by such instruments to be issued by an eligible nonfederal qualified institutional buyer. Designates the Secretary as the lead for purposes of complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for the development of an Arctic deepwater port, regardless of the U.S. agency taking the action that requires compliance with such Act. Establishes the Office of the Federal Arctic Deepwater Port Coordinator as an independent office in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works of the Department of the Army. Makes infrastructure finance funding available to assist developers of Arctic deepwater ports. Authorizes the Commandant of the Coast Guard to: (1) enter into long-term leases for moorage, warehousing, hangar space, and logistical support with Arctic deep water port developers; and (2) convey any property deemed surplus to the Coast Guard's needs in Alaska to any Alaskan borough, municipality, or native corporation seeking to develop such ports. Expands the definition of "deepwater port" under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 to include the use of such structures for general handling of cargo, ship service or repair, logistical support for government and private sector activities at sea, or service as a harbor of refuge.</summary>
