  <summary>4/9/2013--Introduced.
Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act - Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) submit to Congress, within 90 days after enactment of this Act, a list of all commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies that the Secretary believes are too big to fail ("Too Big To Fail List"), including, but not limited to, any U.S. bank holding companies identified by the Financial Stability Board as systemically important banks; and (2) break up entities on the list so that their failure would no longer cause a catastrophic effect on the U.S. or global economy without a taxpayer bailout.</summary>
