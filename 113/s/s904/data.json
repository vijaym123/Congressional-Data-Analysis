Requires the Plan to include the establishment of an online, publicly available information portal to be used by federal agencies and other stakeholders that directs users to key data and tools to inform resilience-enhancing efforts and to build off and complement existing federal efforts. Provides for a coordinating entity to establish and maintain such portal. Requires such coordinating entity to coordinate the implementation of the Plan and to track its progress. Requires the submission of specified reports."
