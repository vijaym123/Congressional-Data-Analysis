Strengthening Health Disparities Data Collection Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to expand the categories of data the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) is required to ensure is collected and reported regarding federally conducted or supported health care or public health programs to include the sexual orientation and gender identity of applicants, recipients, or participants. (Current law requires the collection of data on race, ethnicity, sex, primary language, and disability status.) Eliminates the prerequisite of direct appropriations for the collection of such health data.</summary>
