    "text": "Upper Missisquoi and Trout Wild and Scenic Rivers Act - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate specified segments of the Missisquoi River and Trout River in Vermont as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Requires the river segments designated by this Act to be managed in accordance with the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers Management Plan and any amendments meeting certain criteria. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to coordinate the management responsibilities with the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers Wild and Scenic Committee. Denies that the designation of such segments: (1) precludes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from licensing, relicensing, or authorizing the operation or continued operation of the Troy Hydroelectric, North Troy, or Enosburg Falls hydroelectric projects; or (2) limits the modernization, upgrade, or other changes to such projects. Prohibits consideration as project works under this Act any resource protection, mitigation, or enhancement measures required by FERC hydropower proceedings. Permits the location of such measures within such segments. Limits the authority of the Secretary to acquire lands under this Act to acquisition by donation or with the owner's consent, and subject to additional management plan criteria. Bars the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers from being administered as part of the National Park System or being subject to System regulations."
