Freedom to Fish Act - Prohibits the Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers from taking any action (after August 1, 2012) to establish a restricted area prohibiting public access to waters downstream of a dam owned by the Corps. Requires the Chief to cease implementing any restricted area resulting from such action taken between August 12, 2012, and the date of enactment of this Act and to remove any barriers constructed in connection with that area. Provides that installing and maintaining sirens, strobe lights, and signage for alerting the public of hazardous water conditions shall not be considered to be an action to establish a restricted area.</summary>
