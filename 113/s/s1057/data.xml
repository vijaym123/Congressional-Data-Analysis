Safeguarding Privacy and Fostering Aerospace Innovation Act of 2013 - Amends the federal criminal code to make it unlawful for any person to use a civil unmanned aircraft system (drone) to willfully conduct surveillance of another person (targeted person), unless: (1) the person conducting the surveillance obtains prior express written consent of the targeted person, (2) there is an emergency situation in which the life of an individual is threatened, or (3) the targeted person is in a public place where surveillance would not be highly offensive to a reasonable person. Prescribes penalties for violations of these requirements. Requires the owner of a drone to clearly mark it with the owner's name, address, and telephone number.</summary>
