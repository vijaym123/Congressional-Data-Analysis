Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee on actions necessary to achieve the goal of offering pre-prepared tax returns to taxpayers by tax year 2018, with an analysis of the budgetary, administrative, and legislative barriers to achieving such goal, including the amount of appropriations that would be required.</summary>
