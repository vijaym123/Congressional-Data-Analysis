    "text": "Climate Protection Act of 2013 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to impose: (1) a carbon pollution fee on any manufacturer, producer, or importer of a carbon polluting substance; and (2) a carbon equivalency fee on imports of carbon pollution-intensive goods. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer 50% of the amounts received each fiscal year as a result of the carbon equivalency fee to the Administrator and to the Secretary of Transportation (DOT). Requires the Administrator to use such amounts to: (1) provide amounts to state and local programs that assist communities in adapting to climate change, improving the resiliency of critical infrastructure, and protecting environmental quality and wildlife; and (2) meet international commitments made by the United States to assist with climate change adaptation. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to use such amounts to provide financial support: (1) to state and local programs that assist communities in improving the resiliency of critical infrastructure, and (2) for projects that provide preferential parking for carpools. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator in an amount equal to a specified portion of the amounts received as a result of the carbon pollution fee to provide a monthly residential environmental rebate to legal U.S. residents. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations to establish an Office of Environmental Rebate Advocate to assist households with accessing and using the residential environmental rebate program. Establishes the Pollution Reduction Trust Fund to be used to facilitate the implementation of the carbon pollution reduction program. Directs the Administrator to establish the Sustainable Technologies Finance Program to provide financial assistance for projects that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption from restrictions on underground injection of fluids or propping agents granted to hydraulic fracturing operations relating to oil and gas production activities under such Act. Requires state underground injection programs to direct a person conducting hydraulic fracturing operations to disclose: (1) before the commencement of such operations, the chemicals intended for use in underground injections; and (2) after the end of such operations, the chemicals actually used. Requires the applicable person using hydraulic fracturing, when a medical emergency exists and the proprietary chemical formula of a chemical used in such hydraulic fracturing is necessary for medical treatment, to disclose such formula or the specific chemical identity of a trade secret chemical to the state, the Administrator, or the treating physician or nurse upon request, regardless of the existence of a written statement of need or a confidentiality agreement. Authorizes such person to require the execution of such statement and agreement as soon as practicable. Directs the Administrator to prescribe an underground injection control program for a state, if the Administrator disapproves a state's program. Repeals provisions concerning optional demonstrations to the Administrator by states that show the effectiveness of such state programs relating to oil or natural gas. Authorizes civil penalties for violations of underground injection requirements. Requires the Administrator to: (1) report on the quantity of fugitive methane emissions resulting from any leak in natural gas infrastructure, and (2) enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to report on the quantity of U.S. GHG emissions not covered by a program under this Act and recommendations for programs to reduce such emissions. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should carry out activities to ensure that, by January 1, 2050, the total quantity of GHG emissions released in the United States is reduced by not less than 80% of the emissions released during 2005."
