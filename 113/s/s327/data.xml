  <summary>9/10/2013--Reported to Senate amended.
Good Neighbor Forestry Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), with respect to National Forest System land, and the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land, to enter into a good neighbor agreement (a cooperative agreement or contract, including a sole source contract) with a governor of a state to coordinate the procurement and implementation of authorized restoration services. Defines "authorized restoration services" as similar and complementary forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration services carried out on federal land and non-federal land by either the Secretary concerned or a governor pursuant to a good neighbor agreement. Requires the Secretaries to make good neighbor agreements available to the public. Makes certain National Forest System timber sales requirements of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 inapplicable to services performed under a cooperative agreement or contract entered into under this Act. Requires the Secretaries to provide or approve all silviculture prescriptions and marking guides to be applied on federal land in all timber sale projects conducted under this Act. Prohibits delegation to a governor of any decision required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) with respect to any authorized restoration services to be provided on federal land.</summary>
