  <summary>5/14/2013--Introduced.
Provides that if a person adversely affected by a final decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals who has not filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims within the required 120-day period files a document with the Board or the agency of original jurisdiction within 120 days after the Board's decision expressing disagreement with the decision, such document shall be treated as a motion for reconsideration by the Board. Provides that such a document shall not be considered a motion for reconsideration if the Board or agency of original jurisdiction receives the document, determines that it expresses an intent to appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and forwards the document to such Court within the 120-day period.</summary>
