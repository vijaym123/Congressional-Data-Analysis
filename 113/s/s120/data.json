Encourages the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to continue to support Pakistani education initiatives, especially those for women. Directs the USAID Administrator to increase the number of scholarships available under the Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program (Program) during each fiscal year from FY2013-FY2016 by 30% compared to the number of scholarships awarded during FY2012. Requires all the additional scholarships to be awarded to Pakistani women. Directs the USAID Administrator to make every effort to award 50% of the other scholarships available under the Program to Pakistani women."
