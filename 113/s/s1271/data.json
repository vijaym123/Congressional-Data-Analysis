Requires: (1) each appropriate federal department or agency to begin using such guidelines within one year after their establishment, and (2) the President to submit a related report to Congress within 18 months. Directs the President to require the Secretary of State to revise the Department of State's Internet website, ForeignAssistance.gov, to make publicly available comprehensive and accessible information on U.S. foreign assistance programs on a country-by-country and program-by program basis. Expresses the sense of Congress that Congress shall take into account certain Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports required by this Act when making decisions regarding the appropriation of funds for each department or agency that administers U.S. foreign assistance. Authorizes a department or agency to use up to 5% of its foreign development assistance funds for activities under this Act."
