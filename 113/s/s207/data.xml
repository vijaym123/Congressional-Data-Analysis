Prohibits the U.S. government from allowing the sale, lease, transfer, retransfer, or delivery of F-16 aircraft, M1 tanks, or certain other defense articles or services to Egypt until the President certifies to Congress that Egypt has agreed to: (1) continue to uphold its Camp David Peace Accords commitments, (2) provide proper security at U.S. embassies and consulates, and (3) end its systematic exclusion and silencing of all official minority political opposition parties and engage in dialogue for a power-sharing government with such parties.</summary>
