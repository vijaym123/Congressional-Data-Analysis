  <summary>3/6/2013--Introduced.
Wireless Consumer Choice Act - Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to direct providers of commercial mobile services and commercial mobile data services to permit their subscribers to unlock any type of wireless device used to access such services. (The "unlocking" of a mobile device enables the device to connect to different networks for the purpose of switching service providers.) Prohibits this Act from being construed to alter the terms of any valid contract between a provider and a subscriber.</summary>
