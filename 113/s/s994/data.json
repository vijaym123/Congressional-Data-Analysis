Requires the Board to establish a pilot program relating to reporting by recipients of federal funds to increase financial transparency to: (1) display the full cycle of federal funds, (2) improve the accuracy of federal financial data, and (3) develop recommendations for reducing reporting requirements by consolidating and automating financial reporting requirements across the federal government. Amends the Social Security Act to revise the purposes for information in the National Directory of New Hires to include assisting the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the prevention, identification, and recovery of improper payments to persons under review to determine their eligibility to receive payments or to participate in a federal, state, or local government program. Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to terminate on September 30, 2013, reporting requirements relating to the use of funds under such Act, oversight functions of the Board, and the requirement that the Board maintain a public website. Extends the termination date for the Board until September 30, 2017. Amends the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 to eliminate the Board's responsibility for monitoring the expenditure of funds related to Hurricane Sandy. Requires the Director of OMB to make required financial management status reports and government-wide five-year financial management plans available on the OMB website."
