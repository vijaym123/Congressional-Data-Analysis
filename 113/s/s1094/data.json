    "text": "Strengthening America's Schools Act of 2013 - Revises and reauthorizes programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Title I: College and Career Readiness for All Students - Amends title I of the ESEA to revise the school improvement program under part A. Eliminates the requirement that local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools make adequate yearly progress toward state academic performance standards or be subject to specified improvements, corrective action, or restructuring. Requires states to adopt college and career ready academic content and achievement standards and assessments in reading, mathematics, science, and English language proficiency. Requires states to adopt and implement assessments of student achievement and academic growth toward those standards that: (1) measure the overall performance of students in each public school; and (2) allow for the disaggregation of the results by gender, each major racial and ethnic group, English proficiency status, migrant status, status as a student with a disability, and economically disadvantaged status. Allows states to adopt alternate academic achievement standards and assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Allows states to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments that measure student growth above or below grade level. Directs states that use school improvement funds to support early childhood education to establish, or certify the existence of, early learning guidelines for preschool-aged children and early grade standards for children in kindergarten through grade three. Requires states to establish annual performance targets for LEAs and elementary and secondary schools that include targets for student proficiency, academic growth, English language proficiency for English learners, and high school graduation rates. Requires LEAs to ensure that each school that, after two consecutive years, has not met state performance targets for the same student subgroup develops and implements a locally designed intervention to improve student achievement in that subgroup. Subjects schools to improvement strategies if they are identified as: (1) focus schools due to their having among the largest achievement or graduation gaps among student subgroups in the state; or (2) priority schools due to their status as the lowest achieving schools in the state, high schools with graduation rates below 60%, or focus schools for the six preceding consecutive years. Requires each LEA that serves a focus school to develop and implement a measurable and data-driven correction plan to improve the performance of the school's low-achieving subgroups. Requires LEAs to conduct a data-driven needs analysis of each of their priority schools and use it to select and implement, as appropriate for each school: (1) a transformation strategy, (2) a turnaround strategy, (3) a whole school reform strategy, (4) a restart strategy, or (5) a school closure strategy. Requires LEAs to allow students at priority schools to transfer to another of its public schools that has not been identified as a priority school, unless that option is prohibited by state law. Repeals the School Support and Recognition program. Requires teachers teaching a core academic subject in a program supported with school improvement funds to be highly qualified and certified to teach that subject area, but makes this requirement applicable only to new teachers if the state has fully implemented a professional growth and improvement system. Requires LEAs to show that: (1) combined state and local per-pupil expenditures in each of their schools served under part A are not less than the average combined state and local per-pupil expenditures for their schools not served under part A; or (2) the average combined state and local per-pupil expenditures at its high-poverty schools are no less than those expenditures at its low-poverty schools, if LEAs serve all of their schools under part A. Establishes the Blue Ribbon Schools program that allows states to award their highest performing schools with increased autonomy, flexibility in using ESEA funds, and monetary rewards. Directs the Secretary of Education, acting jointly with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), to designate exemplary early childhood education programs as centers of excellence in early childhood and award each of them a bonus grant to improve the quality of their program and others in their region. Authorizes the Secretary to identify and recognize exemplary schools, programs, and individuals. Directs the Secretary to award grants to states to develop, improve, or administer their college and career ready academic standards and assessments. Replaces part B (Student Reading Skills Improvement Grants) of title I with new Pathways to College grant programs that: (1) assist schools in implementing innovative and effective secondary school reform strategies, and (2) cover part or all of the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) examination fee low-income students incur. Amends the program, under part C (Education of Migratory Children), providing grants to states for the education of migratory children. Requires migratory children to be given the opportunity to meet the same college and career readiness standards as other children. Amends part D (Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth Who are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk). Requires states to ensure that students who have been placed in the juvenile justice system are promptly re-enrolled in secondary school or placed in re-entry programs that best meet their educational and social needs. Includes at-risk Indian children and youth in the program. Replaces part E (National Assessment of Subchapter I) with a new part E (Educational Stability of Children in Foster Care) program to facilitate the educational transition of children that move to a new school attendance area as the result of being placed in foster care, changing their foster care placement, or leaving foster care. Eliminates parts F (Comprehensive School Reform), G (Advanced Placement Programs), and H (School Dropout Prevention). Title II: Supporting Teacher and Principal Excellence - Replaces title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) with a new title II (Supporting Teacher and Principal Excellence).

Title III: Language and Academic Content Instruction for English Learners and Immigrant Students - Revises and renames title III (Language and Academic content Instruction for English Learners and Immigrant Students). Changes the current references to \"limited English proficient students\" to \"English learners.\" Amends part A (English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act), which provides funding to states to improve the education of English learners.

Authorizes Indian tribes or educational entities that receive grants under the part A program to use them for Native American immersion and restoration programs. Revises the professional development grant program for English language instructors. Directs the Secretary to establish an independent commission on the assessment and advancement of English learners to provide the Secretary with advice regarding the education of English learners and their inclusion in state assessment and accountability systems. Requires the Secretary to distribute English language acquisition technology innovation grants for the pursuit of breakthrough research and development in educational technology that benefits English learners.

Establishes a new part D (Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students), which provides funding to states to foster comprehensive improvements to school-level conditions for learning. Establishes a new part E (under provisions entitled the \"Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2013\"), which prohibits public school students from being excluded from participating in, or subject to discrimination under, any federally-assisted educational program on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity or that of their associates. Revises the program under part B (21st Century Community Learning Centers) and places it in a new part F. Includes summer learning and expanded learning time activities in the program.
