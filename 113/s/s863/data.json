(Under current law, there are several more stringent time limits on the use of such assistance.) Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA), under specified conditions, to fund offices of veterans affairs at eligible institutions of higher learning (institutions with at least 50 veteran-enrollees) for veterans' certification, outreach, recruitment, and special education programs. Limits payments to $15,000 per institution per fiscal year. Directs the Secretary to annually collect information about exemplary veterans educational outreach programs, and to disseminate such information to other institutions offering such programs."
