  <summary>4/25/2013--Introduced.
CDBG Public Services Flexibility Act of 2013 - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to revise requirements for activities eligible for community development block grant (CDBG) assistance. Increases from 15% to 25% the limitation on the amount of CDBG assistance that may be used to provide public services (e.g., those concerned with employment, crime prevention, child care, health, drug abuse, education, energy conservation, welfare or recreation needs). (Currently, only the city and county of Los Angeles, California, and the city of Miami, Florida, are favored with the 25% limit on the amount of CDBG assistance that may be used to provide public services.)</summary>
