Dredging for Restoration and Economic Development for Global Exports Act of 2013 or the DREDGE Act of 2013 - Modifies the project for navigation, Mississippi River Ship Channel, Gulf of Mexico to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to direct the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to: (1) achieve, operate, and maintain a navigation channel of 50 feet with respect to the portion of the project from Baton Rouge to the Southwest Pass sea buoy; (2) complete such work not later than the last day of the third fiscal year beginning after the enactment of this Act; (3) conduct a pilot disposal and sediment project in the Southwest Pass area to determine the cost-effectiveness of pump-out disposal operations for hopper dredges for environmental enhancement and dredged material disposal; and (4) consult with appropriate federal, state, and local agencies and stakeholders to determine the safe placement and timing of such pump-out disposal operations that protect, create, restore, and nourish coastal wetlands and aquatic habitat. Requires: (1) all costs of such work to be treated as operation and maintenance costs, including the first costs of achieving a navigation channel of 50 feet; (2) the federal cost share of such work to be 100%; and (3) the Secretary to pay 100% of the costs of such work out of amounts made available from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for operation and maintenance expenses. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to report to Congress on: (1) the cost and the environmental, storm damage reduction, and social benefits of the pump-out disposal operation; and (2) the total quantity of dredge material produced during operation and maintenance activities in the New Orleans District and the quantity that is beneficially used.</summary>
