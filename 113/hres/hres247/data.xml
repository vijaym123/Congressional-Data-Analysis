  <summary>6/4/2013--Introduced.
Calls on the government of Sri Lanka to build on its establishment of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC). Recognizes that the LLRC report did not adequately address issues of accountability for both the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Calls for the establishment of an independent international mechanism to look into allegations of war crimes and other human rights violations committed by all sides during and after the war in Sri Lanka. Encourages Sri Lanka to allow for greater media freedoms. Urges Sri Lanka to allow humanitarian organizations and international human rights groups greater access to the war-affected. Acknowledges the end of the war and the importance of reaching a power-sharing political settlement.</summary>
