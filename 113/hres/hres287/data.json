Requires a committee to adopt a rule to count any member who participates remotely in a hearing as one of the number of members constituting a quorum at the hearing. Amends Rule XV (Business in Order on Special Days) to require the Clerk, Chief Administrative Officer, and Sergeant at Arms to work together to develop and implement a secure remote voting system under which any member absent from the floor shall be permitted to cast a vote remotely on a motion to suspend the rules if the vote is taken by electronic device. Requires the member to be treated as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum for considering the motion."
