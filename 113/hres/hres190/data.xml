  <summary>4/26/2013--Introduced.
Condemns the use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and calls for the full prosecution of those responsible for the IED terrorist attack in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 15, 2013. Expresses condolences to the families of those who were killed in the Boston terrorist attack, and support for those who were injured and their families. Supports U.S. service members, first responders, and explosive ordnance disposal personnel who face the IED threat. Calls on all relevant U.S. agencies to: (1) coordinate with international partners and other responsible entities to reduce the use of IEDs and curb their proliferation; and (2) support the care of active duty service members, veterans, and first responders who are victims of IEDs by facilitating the exchange of blast trauma research data among law enforcement agencies, the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and veterans service organizations. Urges the governments of all nations, as well as the United Nations (U.N.) and other international organizations, to formally renounce the use of IEDs. Calls on the U.S. government to support international action against IEDs and those who traffic in IED components and techniques, and to support IED victims by sharing related event data and information.</summary>
