  <summary>2/5/2013--Introduced.
Condemns unfounded reliance on Stand Your Ground laws to protect actions that extend far beyond historical use of self-defense. Urges state legislatures to reject or repeal Stand Your Ground legislation. Commits to developing incentives for states to find alternatives to such legislation, such as grants for community policing. Encourages states to create penalties for individuals found to have caused substantive harm through racial profiling. Urges the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to seek to elevate the social status of black males by undertaking studies to understand and correct the underlying causes of higher rates of school expulsions and suspensions, homicides, incarceration, poverty, violence, and drug abuse, as well as income, health, and educational disparities.</summary>
