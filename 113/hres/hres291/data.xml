  <summary>7/9/2013--Introduced.
Finds that Argentina has failed to meet G20 membership responsibilities. Calls upon the President and the Secretary of the Treasury to work the G20 members to terminate Argentina's participation until Argentina has: (1) reversed efforts to expropriate foreign investment, (2) satisfied U.S. court judgements against it, (3) honored awards of international arbitral panels against it, and (4) complied with Financial Action Task Force recommendations. Conditions Argentina's G20 membership on its adherence to international norms of economic relations and commitment to the rule of law.</summary>
