  <summary>4/9/2013--Introduced.
Recognizes the importance of the school breakfast program and its overall positive effect on the lives of low-income children and families, as well as its effect on helping to improve a child's overall classroom performance. Expresses support for states that have successfully implemented school breakfast programs in order to improve the test scores and grades of their participating students. Encourages states to: (1) strengthen their school breakfast programs by improving student access and making them part of the school day, (2) work towards the goal of having 70 low-income children eating breakfast for every 100 low-income children eating lunch, (3) promote improvements in the nutritional quality of breakfasts served, and (4) inform students and parents of healthy nutritional and lifestyle choices. Recognizes: (1) that the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 provides low-income children with greater access to nutritious breakfasts; (2) all the partners that help to make successful school breakfast programs; and (3) that National School Breakfast Week helps draw attention to the need for, and success of, the school breakfast program.</summary>
