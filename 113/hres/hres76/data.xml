  <summary>2/15/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the United States and the European Union (EU) would: (1) create significant good-paying jobs for American workers, ranchers, and farmers; (2) open new opportunity for U.S. companies to sell their goods and services in the EU; and (3) further bond the economies of Europe and the United States and give rise to a dominant economic alliance that would strongly influence other nations toward market-based economies. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the President should promptly notify Congress of his intention to enter into negotiations with the EU for a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and, as soon as possible after giving such notice, to initiate such negotiations.</summary>
