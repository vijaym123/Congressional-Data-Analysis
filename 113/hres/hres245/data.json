Honors the advocates who continue to struggle for democracy and human rights in China. Condemns China's: (1) oppression of peaceful religious minorities, such as Buddhists, the Uyghur people, Falun Gong practitioners, and other spiritual movements; and (2) human rights abuses in seeking to quell political dissent and oppress religious minorities. Calls on China to: (1) end the harassment, torture, and imprisonment of Chinese citizens expressing their legitimate freedom of religion, expression, and association; (2) release the remaining 1989 pro-democracy prisoners of conscience; (3) end the oppression of the Uyghur community and the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners; and (4) release U.S. permanent resident Dr. Wang Bingzhang."
