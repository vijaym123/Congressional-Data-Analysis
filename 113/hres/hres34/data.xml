  <summary>1/15/2013--Introduced.
Appeals to the Russian government to allow the adoptions initiated before January 1, 2013, to proceed to conclusion, and invites Russia to continue participation in the bilateral adoption agreement that went into force November 1, 2012. Expresses deep sadness over the deaths in the United States of 19 adopted Russian children and over the other cases of abuse. Celebrates the tens of thousands of U.S. families who have opened their homes and hearts to Russian children. Affirms the extensive work of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Department of State to create safeguards against future abuse through such bilateral adoption agreement. Urges federal, state, and local governments and adoptive families to accommodate official inquiries into the well-being of adopted Russian children and to comply with all adoption requirements delineated by the bilateral agreement.</summary>
