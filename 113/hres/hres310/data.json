Urges the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) not to support national or local elections in Cambodia if such United Nations (U.N.) recommendations are ignored, and if political parties and opposition leaders are excluded or hampered from freely participating in electoral processes. States that: (1) any election in Cambodia that the Secretary of State determines is not credible should be deemed as an illegitimate expression of the Cambodian peoples' will; and (2) a resulting Cambodian government should not be eligible for direct U.S. government assistance, and the Department of State and USAID should reduce assistance for Cambodia and urge international financial institutions to do the same."
