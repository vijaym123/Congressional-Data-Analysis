Expresses solidarity with the people of North Korea who suffer material deprivation and denial of their basic human rights and political liberties. Reaffirms the commitment of the United States to its alliances with Japan and South Korea. Calls upon China to: (1) pressure North Korean leaders to curtail their provocative behavior, abandon their nuclear and missile programs, and comply with all relevant international agreements and resolutions; and (2) prevent the transshipment of illicit technology, military equipment, and dual-use items through its territory, waters, and airspace that could be used in North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Calls on the U.S. government to: (1) apply all available, and seek additional, sanctions on North Korea; (2) utilize legal authorities and resources to defend U.S. interests against North Korean illicit activities; and (3) support the President's commitment to strengthen the U.S. ballistic missile defense system."
