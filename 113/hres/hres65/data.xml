Calls upon China to: (1) pressure North Korean leaders to curtail their provocative behavior, abandon their nuclear and missile programs, and comply with all relevant international agreements and resolutions; and (2) prevent the transshipment of illicit technology, military equipment, and dual-use items through its territory, waters, and airspace that could be used in North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Calls on the U.S. government to: (1) apply all available, and seek additional, sanctions on North Korea; (2) utilize legal authorities and resources to defend U.S. interests against North Korean illicit activities; and (3) support the President's commitment to strengthen the U.S. ballistic missile defense system.</summary>
