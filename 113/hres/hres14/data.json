Amends Rule XVIII (The Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union) also to permit such individuals the right to vote in, and preside over, that Committee. Requires the Committee of the Whole to rise, however, and the Speaker to put the same question to a vote de novo without intervening motion whenever a recorded vote on any question has been decided within the Committee by a margin within which the votes cast by the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner have been decisive. Requires the Committee then to resume its sitting without intervening motion upon the announcement of the vote on that question."
