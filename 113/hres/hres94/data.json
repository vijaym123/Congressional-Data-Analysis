Expresses support for efforts to: (1) work to end gender discrimination and improve women's health by implementing the Affordable Care Act, end health disparities for women, and end gender-based violence; and (2) eliminate discrimination and promote women's health and economic security by ensuring reasonable workplace accommodations for workers whose ability to perform job functions are limited by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition."
