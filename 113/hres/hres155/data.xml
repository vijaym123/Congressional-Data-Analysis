  <summary>4/12/2013--Introduced.
States that: (1) members of the House of Representatives should no longer use the term "illegal immigrant" because no human being is illegal; (2) human beings need to be central in immigration discussions; and (3) foreign national, undocumented immigrant, unauthorized immigrant, immigrant without papers and immigrant seeking status are examples of terms we can use that do not dehumanize people.</summary>
