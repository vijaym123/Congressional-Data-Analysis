  <summary>9/18/2013--Introduced.
Establishes in the House of Representatives a select Committee to investigate and report to the House on: whether the National Security Agency (NSA) violated the rights of American citizens in its surveillance operations; any improper conduct by officials while conducting them or in reporting to Congress about NSA activities; recommendations on what steps can be taken to better guard American citizens' rights from unconstitutional surveillance operations and what further minimization procedures, if any, should be employed by intelligence agencies to ensure American citizens' constitutional rights are protected; whether the large scope of NSA surveillance operations is best suited to protect national security; and any other relevant issues relating to such operations.</summary>
