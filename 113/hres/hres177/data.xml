  <summary>4/23/2013--Introduced.
Urges President Abbas to preempt a succession crisis in the Palestinian Authority (PA) by addressing the current succession plan and by identifying figures committed to the peace process with Israel. Urges the PA and President Abbas to enact reforms to open the political process: (1) through fair and responsible elections; (2) by ensuring freedom of speech, the press, and political assembly; and (3) by allowing a new generation of leadership to freely express their views. Urges the PA to ensure that officials participating in any present or future Palestinian government are committed to the quartet principles, recognition of Israel, renunciation of violence, and adherence to previous diplomatic agreements.</summary>
