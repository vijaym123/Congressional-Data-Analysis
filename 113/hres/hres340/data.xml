  <summary>9/10/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the U.S. national interest is served by further outreach, education, and participation in the Lifeline program (provides a discount on basic telephone service to eligible low-income consumers); (2) the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should be commended for efforts to improve the Lifeline program's efficiency and addressing waste, fraud, and abuse to ensure that federal resources are only going to those who are eligible; (3) the program should be modernized to allow eligible low-income consumers to access affordable telephone or broadband services; and (4) the FCC, National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates (NASUCA) are to be commended for creating "National Telephone Discount Lifeline Awareness Week" to promote subscribership.</summary>
