  <summary>3/6/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the federal government and state governments should make the transition of a member of the Armed Forces and the member's spouse from military to civilian life as seamless as possible by creating opportunities for them to earn civilian occupational credentials and licenses, with an emphasis on well-paying industries and occupations that have a high demand for skilled workers; (2) the federal government should assist state governments in translating military training and experience into credit towards professional licensure; and (3) state governments should streamline approaches for assessing the equivalency of military training and experience and accelerate occupational licensing processes for members, veterans, and their spouses.</summary>
