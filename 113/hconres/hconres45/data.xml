  <summary>7/10/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President has violated Section 3 of Article II of the Constitution by refusing to enforce the employer mandate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA); (2) republican government depends upon the rule of law; (3) the executive branch, which has no constitutional authority to write or rewrite law at whim, has invaded upon the exclusive legislative power of Congress; and (4) PPACA has proven to be unworkable and should be repealed by Congress immediately.</summary>
