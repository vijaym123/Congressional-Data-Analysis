  <summary>10/10/2013--Passed Senate amended.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the provision and availability of religious services and clergy is important to the morale and wellbeing of many members of the Armed Forces and their families. Expresses hope that the Secretary of Defense (DOD) is able to determine that contractor clergy provide necessary support to military personnel, and would therefore be covered under the appropriations made available under the Pay Our Military Act (P.L. 113-39).</summary>
