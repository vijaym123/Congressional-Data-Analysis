  <summary>1/3/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that, except in response to an actual or imminent attack against the United States, the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress violates the exclusive power of Congress to declare war under article I of the Constitution, and therefore constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II.</summary>
