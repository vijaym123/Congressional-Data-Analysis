Prohibits: (1) any unit or individual of the U.S. Armed Forces from being deployed in support of a U.N. or a mutual security treaty military operation absent prior statutory authorization from Congress; and (2) funds from being appropriated or otherwise made available to any U.S. executive agency in order to carry out any U.N. or mutual security treaty military operation unless the President obtains prior authorization by Congress, as required under article I, section 8 of the Constitution."
