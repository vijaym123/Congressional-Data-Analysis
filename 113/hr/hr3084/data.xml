  <summary>9/12/2013--Introduced.
Qualifying Renewable Chemical Production Tax Credit Act of 2013 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should encourage the domestic production of renewable chemicals. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit for the production of renewable chemicals.&#160; Defines "renewable chemical" as any chemical that is: (1) produced in the United States from renewable biomass; (2) sold or used by the taxpayer for the production of chemical products, polymers, plastics, or as chemicals, polymers, plastics, or formulated products; and (3) not sold or used for the production of any food, feed, or fuel.&#160; Exempts certain chemicals, including those with a biobased content of less than 25%. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a five-year program to allocate credit amounts. Limits the total amount of allocable credits under such program to $500 million, with a limit of $25 million to any taxpayer in any taxable year.</summary>
