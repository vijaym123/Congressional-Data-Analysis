Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit for the production of renewable chemicals.\u00a0 Defines \"renewable chemical\" as any chemical that is: (1) produced in the United States from renewable biomass; (2) sold or used by the taxpayer for the production of chemical products, polymers, plastics, or as chemicals, polymers, plastics, or formulated products; and (3) not sold or used for the production of any food, feed, or fuel.\u00a0 Exempts certain chemicals, including those with a biobased content of less than 25%. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a five-year program to allocate credit amounts. Limits the total amount of allocable credits under such program to $500 million, with a limit of $25 million to any taxpayer in any taxable year."
