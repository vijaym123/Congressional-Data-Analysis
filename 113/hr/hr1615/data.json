Requires the study to include consideration of: (1) gaps in mental health treatment services for adults and children with severe and persistent mental illness; (2) barriers to receiving mental health services that result in high rates of untreated mental illness, and (3) the availability of interventions such as assisted outpatient treatment designed to reach individuals with untreated severe mental illness."
