  <summary>4/18/2013--Introduced.
Examining America's Mental Health Services Act of 2013 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine (or, if the Institute declines to enter into such an arrangement, another appropriate entity) to conduct a comprehensive study on gaps in mental health services and how these gaps can increase the risk of violent acts. Requires the study to include consideration of: (1) gaps in mental health treatment services for adults and children with severe and persistent mental illness; (2) barriers to receiving mental health services that result in high rates of untreated mental illness, and (3) the availability of interventions such as assisted outpatient treatment designed to reach individuals with untreated severe mental illness.</summary>
