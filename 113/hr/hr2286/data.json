Requires the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to make publicly available and update an online bibliographic database identifying systematic reviews, including an explanation of the level and quality of evidence, for the care of childbearing women and newborns. Requires the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration to: (1) designate maternity care health professional shortage areas under the National Health Service Corps program, and (2) award planning and implementation grants to address workforce disparities for such professionals. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support the establishment of two additional Centers for Excellence on Optimal Maternity Outcomes to conduct research to improve maternity outcomes. Requires the Secretary to convene an Interprofessional Maternity Provider Education Commission to discuss and make recommendations for: (1) a consensus standard physiologic maternity care curriculum that takes into account the core competencies for basic midwifery practice and the educational objectives for physicians practicing in obstetrics and gynecology, (2) suggestions for multidisciplinary use of the consensus physiologic curriculum, (3) strategies to integrate and coordinate education across maternity care disciplines, and (4) pilot demonstrations of interprofessional educational models. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to cover services provided by a supervised student midwife or an intern or resident-in-training under a teaching program under certain circumstances."
