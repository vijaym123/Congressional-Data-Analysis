Requires each agency that awards design and construction contracts to submit to the Comptroller General (GAO) and publish in the Federal Register an annual report on: (1) all contracts for which more than five finalists were selected for phase-two requests for competitive proposals, and (2) contracts having a value of $750,000 or greater for which the two-phase selection process was not used. Requires the Comptroller General to publish a report that analyzes the compliance of federal agencies with the requirements of this Act."
