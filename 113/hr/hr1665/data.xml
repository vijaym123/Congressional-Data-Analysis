  <summary>4/23/2013--Introduced.
Drunk Driving Repeat Offender Prevention Act of 2013 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to withhold specified graduated percentages of a state's apportionment of certain federal-aid highway funds for FY2016-FY2018 if the state has not enacted and is not enforcing a law requiring the installation of an ignition interlock device for a minimum of 180 days on each motor vehicle operated by an individual convicted of driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence (having a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or greater). Authorizes reduction of the 180-day period to 90 days if: (1) the driver's license is suspended for a minimum of 180 days as a result of the conviction, and (2) the period for installation of an ignition interlock device begins after the last day of the suspension.</summary>
