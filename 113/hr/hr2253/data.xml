Reduces the allowable amount of such credit to the extent that household income exceeds 400% of the federal poverty line. Repeals the tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses. Expresses the sense of Congress that any revenue saved by the enactment of this Act shall be applied to the currently projected Pell Grant funding shortfall in 2015 and to deficit reduction</summary>
