  <summary>4/11/2013--Introduced.
Veterans' Privacy Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to prescribe regulations to ensure that any visual recording made of a patient during the course of furnishing care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is carried out only with the full and informed consent of that patient or, in appropriate cases, a representative thereof. Allows the Secretary to waive such requirement if the recording is made: (1) upon a determination by a physician or psychologist that the recording is medically necessary, (2) pursuant to a warrant or order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (3) in a public setting where a person would not have a reasonable expectation to privacy (such as a waiting room or hallway) and the recording is for general security purposes not particularized to the patient.</summary>
