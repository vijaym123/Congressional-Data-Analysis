Makes an exception for funds obligated for non-lethal humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people provided directly by the U.S. government through nongovernmental organizations and contractors or foreign governments. Nullifies such prohibition only if a joint resolution approving assistance for military or paramilitary operations in Syria is enacted. Directs the Secretary of State to report every 90 days on assistance provided to groups, organizations, movements, and individuals in Syria."
