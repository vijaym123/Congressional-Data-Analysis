  <summary>6/25/2013--Introduced.
Protecting Americans from the Proliferation of Weapons to Terrorists Act of 2013 - Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds made available to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Department of Defense (DOD), or any other U.S. agency or entity involved in intelligence activities for the purpose of, or in a manner which would have the effect of, supporting military or paramilitary operations in Syria. Makes an exception for funds obligated for non-lethal humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people provided directly by the U.S. government through nongovernmental organizations and contractors or foreign governments. Nullifies such prohibition only if a joint resolution approving assistance for military or paramilitary operations in Syria is enacted. Directs the Secretary of State to report every 90 days on assistance provided to groups, organizations, movements, and individuals in Syria.</summary>
