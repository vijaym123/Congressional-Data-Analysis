  <summary>2/6/2013--Introduced.
Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to declare that a qualified preretirement survivor annuity with respect to a participant under a multiemployer plan which becomes insolvent or is terminated shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the participant has not died as of the date on which the plan became so insolvent or the termination date. (Thus guarantees, in the absence of other disqualifying factors, the payment by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC] of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity to a participant of a multiemployer pension plan which becomes insolvent or is terminated.)</summary>
