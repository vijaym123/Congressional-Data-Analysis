  <summary>10/4/2013--Introduced.
Support Our Department of Defense Civilian Employees Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that all civilian employees and contractors of the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Coast Guard serve to provide support to members of the Armed Forces. Amends the Pay Our Military Act (P.L. 113-39) to make FY2014 continuing appropriations for any period during which interim or full-year appropriations for FY2014 are not in effect to provide for: (1) pay and allowances to all civilian personnel of DOD (and the Department of Homeland Security [DHS] in the case of the Coast Guard) (under such Act only personnel whom the Secretary concerned determines are providing support to members of the Armed Forces performing active service); and (2) compensation to all employees of contractors of DOD, and DHS in the case of the Coast Guard (under such Act only contractors whom the Secretary concerned determines are providing support to members of the Armed Forces performing active service). Requires the Secretary of Defense (and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard) to ensure that all civilian personnel of DOD and the Coast Guard who were not in "retained" or "excepted" status at any time during the period beginning on October 1, 2013, are treated as retained or excepted during the period for which such continuing appropriations are made available, effective as of the enactment of this Act.</summary>
