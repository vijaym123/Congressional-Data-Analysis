  <summary>7/30/2013--Introduced.
Growing Responsible Energy Efficient Neighborhoods Jobs Act of 2013 or the GREEN Jobs Act of 2013 - Amends the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 to allow financial and technical assistance provided under such Act to be used by community development financial institutions to develop or support small businesses that provide green jobs to low-income individuals in low-income communities. Limits such assistance to $2 million in financial assistance and $100,000 in technical assistance. Defines "green jobs" as jobs that: (1) aim to protect or restore ecosystems and biodiversity; (2) reduce energy, materials, and water consumption through high efficiency strategies; (3) reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants; (4) minimize or altogether avoid generation of all forms of waste and pollution; or (5) increase the use of energy generation systems such as solar, fuel cells, natural gas, and micro turbines.</summary>
