  <summary>5/23/2013--Introduced.
Small Business Credit Availability Act - Amends the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to exclude from the meaning of financial entity any small bank, savings association, farm credit system institution, non-profit cooperative lender controlled by electric cooperatives, or credit union if the aggregate uncollateralized outward exposure plus aggregate potential outward exposure of the entity with respect to its swaps does not exceed $1 billion. (Thus exempts such entities from the clearing requirement.)</summary>
