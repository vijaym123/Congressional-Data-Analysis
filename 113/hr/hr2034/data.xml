  <summary>5/16/2013--Introduced.
Advanced Composites Development Act of 2013 - Directs the Secretaries of Transportation (DOT), Energy (DOE), Defense (DOD), and Homeland Security (DHS), to carry out a program to improve the nation's transportation infrastructure, advance the technologies used to produce alternative energy, enhance our military security, and develop new disaster mitigation systems by making grants to consortia for the establishment and operation of Advanced Composites Development Centers. Instructs the Secretaries to work with stakeholders to identify problems that can be solved over a period of five years through the development of an advanced composite material. Requires such Centers, by working with the private sector, to strive to produce new composite materials, including related manufacturing processes or applications, that: (1) are lighter, stronger, and more durable than existing materials; (2) have lower life-cycle costs or lower overall environmental impacts; and (3) have an immediate practical application.</summary>
