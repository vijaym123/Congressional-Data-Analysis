Allows the charging of a fee for admission to an exhibit, however, if: (1) charging a fee is necessary and unavoidable, (2) the Secretary submits a statement explaining the determination to Congress, and (3) the charging of such fee does not become effective until after the expiration of a 45-day period beginning on the date the statement is submitted. Makes such prohibition non-applicable to the exhibit \"Butterfly Pavilion\" at the National Museum of Natural History. Requires the Secretary to submit a plan for eliminating the admission fee for such exhibit, including steps to cover the expenses incurred in carrying out the exhibit."
