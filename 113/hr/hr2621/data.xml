  <summary>7/8/2013--Introduced.
Prohibits the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from charging a fee for admission to an exhibit that is part of the permanent collection of any museum or facility that is part of any bureau established in or under the Smithsonian Institution, including the National Gallery of Art. Allows the charging of a fee for admission to an exhibit, however, if: (1) charging a fee is necessary and unavoidable, (2) the Secretary submits a statement explaining the determination to Congress, and (3) the charging of such fee does not become effective until after the expiration of a 45-day period beginning on the date the statement is submitted. Makes such prohibition non-applicable to the exhibit "Butterfly Pavilion" at the National Museum of Natural History. Requires the Secretary to submit a plan for eliminating the admission fee for such exhibit, including steps to cover the expenses incurred in carrying out the exhibit.</summary>
