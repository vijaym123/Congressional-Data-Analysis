Limits funding amounts to 75% of the total cost of eligible activities to be carried out using those amounts. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator to carry out this Act for each of FY2013-FY20. Prohibits such amounts from being used by a management conference under the National Estuary Program.</summary>
