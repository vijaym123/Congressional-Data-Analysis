Prohibits a multiyear stewardship contract from exceeding a 20-year period (under current law, a 10-year period). Bars the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretaries) from being required to obligate funds to cover the costs of cancelling or terminating multiyear stewardship contracts or agreements until they are cancelled or terminated. Specifies the funding sources from which the costs of cancelling or terminating a multiyear stewardship contract may be paid. Requires 25% of timber sale receipts from a multiyear stewardship contract or agreement to be paid to the county within whose boundaries the receipts are derived. Authorizes the Secretaries to enter into cooperative agreements and contracts with state foresters to provide forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration and protection services. Permits state foresters to enter into subcontracts to provide such restoration and protection services. Prohibits the extension of such an agreement or contract beyond a 20-year period."
