  <summary>1/25/2013--Introduced.
Protect Our Military Trainees Act - Amends the Uniform Code of Military Justice to establish sexual assault and abusive sexual contact offenses that prohibit covered military instructors from committing sexual acts upon, or causing sexual contact upon or by, members of the armed forces undergoing basic training if the military instructor exercised supervisory authority over the member. Requires violators to be punished as a court-martial may direct. Defines "covered military instructors" as drill sergeants in the Army, drill instructors in the Marine Corps, recruit division commanders in the Navy, military training instructors in the Air Force, company commanders in the Coast Guard, and such other members as the Secretary concerned may designate as having supervisory authority over new recruits undergoing basic training or its equivalent. Prohibits consent from being a defense in any such prosecution.</summary>
