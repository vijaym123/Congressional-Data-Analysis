  <summary>5/21/2013--Introduced.
Amends the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Assistance Act of 1978 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to waive, for up to seven years, Tribally Controlled Colleges or Universities Grant program eligibility requirements for tribally controlled colleges or universities that: (1) have received assistance under that program for ten consecutive years, (2) are located on Indian land in a county whose Indian population did not decrease by more than 1% between the two most recent decennial censuses, and (3) the Secretary determines will use the waiver to support higher education opportunities appropriate to Indian needs. (The requirements that may be waived deal with school governance, adherence to Indian needs, student body composition, and accreditation.) Deems an application for such a waiver to be approved if the Secretary does not act upon it within 30 days of its receipt.</summary>
