Permits a recipient to use grant funds to train military and civilian personnel in the new technologies and to conduct a study regarding the economic feasibility of a full-scale bio-based aviation fuel production facility. Directs the Secretary to give preference to a center that: (1) has the capacity and expertise necessary to quickly and efficiently conduct such research, development, and testing; and (2) is located in close proximity to specified raw materials, a military installation with responsibility for military air transportation, and a private or commercial airport with capacity to host a research and pilot production facility."
