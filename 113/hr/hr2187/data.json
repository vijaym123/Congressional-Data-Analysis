Authorizes the Attorney General to award such grants to states, state courts, local courts, local governments, and Indian tribal governments for court programs that involve: (1) continuing judicial supervision over offenders who are veterans with substance abuse or mental health problems, (2) coordination with appropriate federal, state, or local prosecutors; (3) coordination with the Veterans Health Administration; and (4) the integrated administration of other sanctions and services, including substance abuse and mental health treatment, supervised release involving the possibility of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration based on non-compliance with program requirements or failure to show satisfactory progress, and offender management. Prohibits the use of grant funds to provide judicial supervision over, treatment of, or other services to violent offenders. Sets forth application and reporting requirements. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study to assess the effectiveness and impact of such grant program."
