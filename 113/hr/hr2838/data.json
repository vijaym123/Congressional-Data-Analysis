Repeals authority to issue a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement for a vessel to transport liquified natural gas or liquified petroleum gas to Puerto Rico from other ports in the United States, if the vessel: (1) is a foreign built vessel that was built before October 19, 1996; or (2) was documented before that date, even if it is placed under a foreign registry and subsequently redocumented for operation. Exempts from coastwise endorsement requirements self-propelled vessels that transport bulk cargo, including liquified natural gas or liquified petroleum bulk cargo, to Puerto Rico from another U.S. port or from Puerto Rico to another U.S. port."
