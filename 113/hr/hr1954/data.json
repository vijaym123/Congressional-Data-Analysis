Abolishes by December 31 of each year, beginning with 2015, the three executive departments reviewed by the Comptroller General during the preceding year. Requires the President to direct procedures for the winding down of the operations of each abolished department. Allows Congress to authorize the continued existence of an executive department scheduled for abolishment. Sets forth the process for congressional consideration of the Comptroller General's report, including an expedited procedure for consideration of resulting legislation to be known as a wasteful expenditures bill."
