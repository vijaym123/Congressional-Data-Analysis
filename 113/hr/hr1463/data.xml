  <summary>4/10/2013--Introduced.
Military Suicide Reduction Act - Requires the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to provide a one-on-one mental health assessment for each member of the Armed Forces deployed in support of a contingency operation once during each 180-day period of such deployment. Requires that, if the Secretary determines that such assessment cannot be performed by personnel trained and certified to do so, the Secretary shall ensure that the assessment is conducted using an Internet-based questionnaire. Requires, in such case, that the commanding officer (CO) of such member also complete a separate questionnaire containing the CO's observations with respect to the mental health of that member. Requires such questionnaires to: (1) be reviewed and acted upon by trained and certified mental health personnel, and (2) be accorded appropriate privacy under requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.</summary>
