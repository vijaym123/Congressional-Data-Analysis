  <summary>9/18/2013--Introduced.
Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students Act of 2013 - Amends title IV (21st Century Schools) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to award grants to states to: (1) develop, improve, and implement state reporting and information systems that measure conditions for learning, based on surveys of school students and staff; and (2) award competitive subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) or nonprofit organizations that use such measurement systems to make comprehensive improvements to school-level conditions for learning. Identifies conditions conducive to learning as those that: (1) promote physical activity, education, fitness, and nutrition; (2) promote mental health; (3) prevent violence, harassment, and substance abuse among students; and (4) promote safe and supportive schools and communities. Conditions a state's grant eligibility on the state: (1) having a statewide physical education requirement that is consistent with widely recognized standards; and (2) requiring its LEAs to establish policies that prevent and prohibit harassment in schools, to notify students, parents, and educational professionals of prohibited conduct each year, and to provide students and parents with grievance procedures that target such conduct. Directs the Secretary to evaluate the programs this Act funds and provide technical assistance to program applicants, grantees, and subgrantees.</summary>
