  <summary>6/20/2013--Introduced.
Ports as Small Business Incubators Act of 2013 - Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish the Ports as Small Business Incubators Program. Requires the Administrator to award grants of at least $300,000 and up to $500,000 to port authorities selected by the Administrator. Allows grant funds to be used only for the costs of providing selected small businesses with access to commercial real property. Requires each Program participant, in providing such access, to give a priority to small businesses owned and controlled by women, veterans, or socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, as well as those that the participant determines would create "green" jobs (jobs involving the development of clean energy and the improvement of air and water quality).</summary>
