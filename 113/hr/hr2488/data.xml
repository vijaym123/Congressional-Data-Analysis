Rogue Wilderness Area Expansion Act - Adds specified federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Wild Rogue Wilderness as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Requires the part of the Rogue River, which lies within the Wild Rogue Wilderness, including the Wilderness additions, and was designated under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act as a component of the System in 1968, to be managed as a wild river. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to add specified segments of creeks to the designation of the Rogue River in Oregon as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers system. Prohibits: (1) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from licensing the construction of any dam, water conduit, reservoir, powerhouse, transmission line, or other project works affecting specified stream segments; and (2) any federal department or agency from assisting in the construction of any water resources project affecting any such segment, except for maintaining or repairing existing projects.</summary>
