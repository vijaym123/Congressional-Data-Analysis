Limits the administration of the oath: (1) by a Senator to individuals who reside in the Senator's state; and (2) by a Member of the House of Representatives, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner to individuals who reside in the respective congressional district. Limits the Member's authority solely to the administration of such oath. Prohibits a Member from administering the oath during the 90-day period before any election for federal, state, or local office in which the Member is a candidate. Requires a Member to administer the oath only at times and places designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS). Prohibits a Member from administering the oath during any period in which exclusive authority to administer it may be exercised by an eligible court for the person concerned, unless the court has waived such exclusive authority."
