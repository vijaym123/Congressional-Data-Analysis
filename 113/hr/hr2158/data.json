Defines a \"qualified stop\": (1) as any intermediate stop in an airport of a covered snake in a secure container in the course of transport of such snake that begins in an airport located at a designated port (as defined in regulations by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on importing, exporting, and transporting wildlife) and ends at a place outside of the United States no later than 48 hours after such transport begins; and (2) to exclude any stop in Hawaii. Authorizes such stop to include: (1) a stop to refuel or take on additional cargo or passengers at an airport that is not a designated airport; or (2) a transfer of the secure container in an airport between aircraft used for such transport outside of the United States."
