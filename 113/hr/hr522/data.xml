  <summary>2/6/2013--Introduced.
Balanced Budget Accountability Act - Requires each house of Congress to adopt a concurrent budget resolution for a fiscal year which provides that, for each fiscal year for which a budget is provided under the resolution (beginning by FY2023), total outlays do not exceed total receipts. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), upon the adoption by a chamber of a concurrent budget resolution for a fiscal year, to transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President pro Tempore of the Senate (as the case may be) a certification as to whether or not that chamber has met the requirements of this Act with respect to the resolution. Requires the appropriate payroll administrator of each chamber to deposit in an escrow account all mandatory payments for compensation of Members of Congress serving in that chamber if CBO does not certify that it has adopted a concurrent budget resolution for FY2015 before April 16, 2014. Requires deposits to begin on such date and to be released to appropriate Members on the earlier of: the day on which CBO certifies that the house of Congress has met the requirements of this Act with respect to FY2015, or the last day of the 113th Congress.</summary>
