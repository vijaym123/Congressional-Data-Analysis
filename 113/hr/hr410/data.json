Nullifies any such executive action and prohibits the use of appropriated funds to promulgate or enforce any such action. Authorizes the following persons to bring an action in an appropriate U.S. court to challenge the validity of any such executive action: (1) any member or either or both chambers of Congress, (2) the highest governmental official of any state or political subdivision if the challenged action infringes on a power of such state under any congressional enactment or relevant treaty, and (3) any person aggrieved in a liberty or property interest adversely affected by the challenged action."
