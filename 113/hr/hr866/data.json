Requires those programs to: (1) permit parents, regardless of income, to enroll their four-year old children at a school in which their children may be enrolled for kindergarten; (2) run for the length of the regular school year; and (3) be taught by teachers who possess qualifications similar to the qualifications of other teachers at the applicable school. Prohibits the federal share of a prekindergarten program grant from exceeding 80% of the prekindergarten program's costs."
