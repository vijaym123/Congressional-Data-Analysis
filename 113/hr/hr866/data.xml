  <summary>2/27/2013--Introduced.
Universal Prekindergarten and Early Childhood Education Act of 2013 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to states to establish full-day prekindergarten programs at public schools. Requires those programs to: (1) permit parents, regardless of income, to enroll their four-year old children at a school in which their children may be enrolled for kindergarten; (2) run for the length of the regular school year; and (3) be taught by teachers who possess qualifications similar to the qualifications of other teachers at the applicable school. Prohibits the federal share of a prekindergarten program grant from exceeding 80% of the prekindergarten program's costs.</summary>
