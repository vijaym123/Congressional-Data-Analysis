  <summary>8/2/2013--Introduced.
Gun Violence Prevention and Safe Communities Act of 2013 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the excise tax on the sale of firearms by manufacturers, producers, or importers, to: (1) increase the rate of such tax to 20% on pistols, revolvers, and other firearms and on any lower frame or receiver for a firearm; and (2) impose a 50% tax on shells and cartridges. Exempts any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States from such tax. Allocates revenues from the increased excise tax under this Act for law enforcement and public safety grant programs, including programs for research on gun violence and its prevention. Increases the occupational tax on importers, manufacturers, and dealers in firearms and the transfer tax on firearms. Modifies the definition of "firearm" for excise tax purposes to include a semiautomatic pistol chambered for cartridges and configured with receivers commonly associated with rifles and capable of accepting detachable magazines.</summary>
