Exempts any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States from such tax. Allocates revenues from the increased excise tax under this Act for law enforcement and public safety grant programs, including programs for research on gun violence and its prevention. Increases the occupational tax on importers, manufacturers, and dealers in firearms and the transfer tax on firearms. Modifies the definition of \"firearm\" for excise tax purposes to include a semiautomatic pistol chambered for cartridges and configured with receivers commonly associated with rifles and capable of accepting detachable magazines."
