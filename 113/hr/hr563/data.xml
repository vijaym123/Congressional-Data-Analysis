  <summary>2/6/2013--Introduced.
School Social Workers Improving Student Success Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award renewable grants to high-need local educational agencies (LEAs) to retain or hire additional school social workers. Permits grantees to use the funds to reimburse school social workers for expenses they incur in rendering services. Requires grant-funded social workers to target their services to the highest-need students. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance to high-need LEAs in applying for such grants. Prohibits the grant funds from being used to supplant other federal, state, or local funds used for hiring and retaining school social workers.</summary>
