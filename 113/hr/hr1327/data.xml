Free Syria Act of 2013 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: the United States should increase its humanitarian support for those affected by the conflict in Syria; Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon should be commended for keeping its borders open to Syrian refugees; the President should urge other countries in the area to keep their borders open for such purpose, and should urge the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to expedite the protection and resettlement of the most vulnerable refugees; the President should provide temporary immigration relief measures for and grant humanitarian parole to Syrian nationals with approved immigrant petitions; the United States should coordinate its assistance efforts with the Syrian Opposition Coalition's Assistance Coordination Unit; individuals within the Bashar al Assad (Assad) regime who have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity must be brought to justice; U.S. military assistance should be provided only to groups demonstrating a commitment to securing, safeguarding, and ultimately eliminating Syrian chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons-related materials; the United States should provide non-lethal military equipment to friendly Syrian opposition military forces; all countries should deny the use of their airspace to Syrian-bound Iranian aircraft containing weapons; and the United States and its partners should take steps to ensure that women are full and equal participants in negotiations regarding the future of Syria and in all transitional and future Syrian government institutions. Outlines governing principles for the provision of U.S. humanitarian assistance to address the Syrian conflict. Authorizes assistance for the protection of women, children, and other vulnerable populations affected.

Authorizes the President to direct the drawdown of Department of Defense (DOD) defense articles and services, and to provide military education and training, for such forces.
