Reducing Barriers to Learning Act of 2013 - Amends the Department of Education Organization Act to create an Office of Specialized Instructional Support within the Department of Education to improve specialized instructional support services in schools. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award competitive matching grants to states to: (1) establish or expand specialized instructional support services and programs at the state level that are designed to provide technical assistance, coordination, and support to specialized instructional support services and programs addressing barriers to learning within local educational agencies and individual schools; and (2) hire and support specialized instructional support services coordinators to provide such assistance, coordination, and support. Replaces references to pupil services and pupil services personnel with references to specialized instructional support services and specialized instructional support personnel. Defines "specialized instructional support services" as services provided by school counselors, social workers, psychologists, nurses, and other qualified professionals that provide assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs.</summary>
