Accessing Military Education Benefits Act - Provides that when a member of the Armed Forces is assigned to duty in an area for which hostile fire, imminent danger, or hazardous duty pay is authorized, the Secretary of Defense (DOD) shall ensure that, if such member has any direct student loans, the member shall automatically obtain the benefits of the Higher Education Act of 1965 which prohibit the accrual of student loan interest for active-duty military personnel. Requires the Secretary to submit to the congressional defense committees a plan for the implementation of such requirement.</summary>
