Defines: (1) "emergency training" as training of new employees in positions designated as "emergency"; and (2) "critical training" as training of state and local officers, training for international law enforcement officers occurring in the United States, and training of international law enforcement officers abroad (such as the training of officers who will be working in a combat zone) that is deemed necessary to protect human life or property.</summary>
