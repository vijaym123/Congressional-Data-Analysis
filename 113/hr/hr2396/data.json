Allows expenditures from the Coal Mitigation\u00a0Trust Fund to assist states\u00a0in mitigating noise, vibration, traffic delays, pollution and other threats to public health, and emergencies in connection with the transportation of coal by rail, and\u00a0to provide worker adjustment assistance. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to issue regulations to require all rail cars transporting coal to be covered or to incorporate a suitable alternative technology to ensure that coal and coal dust do not escape during transportation."
