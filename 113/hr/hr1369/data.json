Exempts the purchase or sale of a firearm for use by a federal, state, or local agency. Defines \"qualified liability insurance policy\" to mean a policy that: (1) provides liability insurance covering the purchaser specifically for losses resulting from use of the firearm while it is owned by the purchaser, and (2) is issued by an insurer licensed or authorized to provide the coverage by the state in which the purchaser resides."
