Reduces each outlay cap for FY2015-FY2018 by 1% of the previous fiscal year's outlay cap (as estimated by CBO before March of such fiscal year). Requires the outlay cap for FY2019 and each subsequent fiscal year to be 18% of the CBO-estimated gross domestic product (GDP) for that calendar year. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order in both chambers to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, or conference report that includes any provision that would cause the most recently reported, current outlay cap to be exceeded. Prescribes procedures for waiver or suspension of this rule."
