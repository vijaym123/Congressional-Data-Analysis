    "text": "Prioritizing Debt Reduction in U.S. Foreign Assistance Act of 2013 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the growing federal debt jeopardizes U.S. national security and economic stability, and (2) paying money owed to America's major foreign debt holders is a better use of American taxpayer dollars than providing such debt holders with foreign assistance. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit, with specified exceptions, assistance to any country whose government holds more than $500 billion in U.S. Treasury securities. Directs the Secretary of State to report to Congress on the provision of U.S. foreign assistance to countries whose governments hold U.S. Treasury securities."
