Requires domestic violence tribal liaisons to: encourage and assist in arrests and federal prosecutions for domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in Indian country; train law enforcement officers and others responsible for responding to crimes in Indian country; develop multidisciplinary teams to combat domestic and sexual violence against Indians; work with tribal justice officials and victims' advocates to address any backlog in the prosecution of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in Indian country; and develop working relationships and maintain communication with tribal leaders, tribal community and victims' advocates, and tribal justice officials to exchange information with tribal justice officials. Directs the Attorney General to appoint qualified tribal prosecutors and other qualified attorneys to assist in prosecuting federal offenses committed in the Indian country of at least ten federally recognized tribes. Gives a preference to those tribes that have the highest rates of domestic violence and sexual assault. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on: (1) the prevalence of domestic violence and sexual assault in Indian country, (2) the efforts of federal law enforcement agencies to investigate those crimes, and (3) federal initiatives to help address and prevent such violence."
