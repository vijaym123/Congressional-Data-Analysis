Establishes eligibility requirements for a consortium (a partnership of two or more universities, health care organizations, or government agencies, or any combination of such entities), including that: (1) it has the capability to enroll a minimum of 25 individuals with a diagnosis of NMO as research participants from the designated catchment area (geographical area), and (2) that the catchment area does not overlap with any other consortium receiving a grant under this Act."
