Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to require all retail establishments that sell video games to display information about the ESRB content rating system. Prohibits any person from selling or renting video games containing the ESRB content rating of: (1) \"adults only\" to any person under the age of 18, or (2) \"mature\" to any person under the age of 17.
