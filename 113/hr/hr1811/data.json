Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System to remove from Florida System Unit P-16 the areas of Collier County, Florida, known as Royal Marco Point on Marco Island and La Peninsula of the Isles of Capri in Naples. Exempts such removed areas from provisions denying new insurance coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program to properties in violation of state or local laws restricting land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas, thereby making new flood insurance available to the removed areas. Prohibits the removed areas from being denied flood insurance pursuant to such restrictions unless: (1) the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) determines that such property would have been declared by a state or local zoning authority to be in violation of state or local laws without regard to whether this Act had been in effect at the time of such declaration; or (2) after the enactment of this Act, a state or local zoning authority finds such property to be in violation of such state or local laws."
