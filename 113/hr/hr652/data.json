    "text": "Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit assistance (other than humanitarian assistance) to a country that follows any of the following activities: (1) engages in state-sanctioned religious persecution of minority religious groups as evidenced by anti-blasphemy laws or penalties applied to minority religious groups for sharing their faith; (2) prevents equal access to education on the basis of gender, race, or ethnicity; or (3) does not accept the return of its nationals who have been removed from another country following a removal proceeding. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition on a case-by-case basis if in U.S. national security interests to do so."
