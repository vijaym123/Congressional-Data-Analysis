    "text": "Military Family Home Protection Act - Amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (the Act) to allow a court, in an action to enforce an obligation on real or personal property secured by a mortgage against a servicemember who is, or was, eligible for hostile fire or imminent danger pay during a period of military service, a servicemember placed on convalescent status, a veteran who was medically discharged and retired, or the surviving spouse of a member who died during military service, to stay such proceedings, upon request of a covered individual, for a specified period (generally, one year after the event occurred for which the individual became covered). Prohibits the sale, foreclosure, or seizure of the subject property during such period, except upon a court order or pursuant to an agreement authorized under the Act. Requires the individual so covered to notify the mortgagee, trustee, or other creditor of such coverage. Provides a criminal penalty for violations of the sale or foreclosure prohibitions, and increases current civil penalties for mortgage violations under the Act. Prohibits an individual from being denied or refused credit solely by reason of eligibility for relief under this Act. Requires a servicemember-mortgagor who does not reside in the mortgage-secured residence due to military relocation and who inquires about, or applies for, a refinancing to be considered to occupy such residence during the period of the relocation. Requires each lending institution acting as a creditor to such servicemember, veteran, or surviving spouse to designate an employee responsible for ensuring the institution's compliance with the requirements of this Act. Requires any such institution that had prior annual assets of $10 billion or more to maintain on its primary website a toll-free number for information concerning such requirements."
