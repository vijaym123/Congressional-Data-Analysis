Allows such an extension until the earlier of the end of the course or 12 weeks, in the case of an educational institution not regularly operated on a quarter or semester basis. Repeals the delimiting period for the use of assistance under the post-Vietnam era veterans' educational assistance program (generally 10 years after the veteran's last discharge or release from active duty). Applies the assistance extension provided under the all-volunteer force educational assistance program to the post-9/11 veterans' educational assistance program."
