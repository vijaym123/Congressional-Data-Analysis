  <summary>5/16/2013--Introduced.
End Anonymous Patents Act - Requires entities issued a patent to file with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) a disclosure of the identity of the patent owner and any real parties in interest. Directs patent owners to also make such disclosures to the USPTO upon the payment of maintenance fees. Requires an entity to which a patent, patent application, or interest is sold, granted, or conveyed to file with the USPTO a disclosure of the sale, grant, or conveyance, and any real party in interest in the patent, application, or interest. Specifies that "real parties in interest" include: (1) any entity that has the legal right to enforce the patent through an infringement action, (2) any ultimate parent entity (not controlled by any other entity) of such an entity, and (3) any entity that has a controlling interest in the enforcement of the patent. Limits the damages available in a patent infringement action by an entity that fails to comply with the requirements of this Act to only those damages occurring from the date on which the requirements are met.</summary>
