Replaces entitlement to a matching grant with entitlement to a supplemental grant for such territories of: (1) 10% of the payable family assistance grant to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam; and (2) $100,000 to American Samoa. Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of SSA title XI to make such territories: (1) eligible for the TANF Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs, (2) Needy States if they satisfy alternative eligibility criteria established by the Secretary, and (3) eligible for child care entitlement funds. Prescribes a formula for allotment of child care entitlement funds to such territories. Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of SSA title XI to increase the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for foster care and adoption assistance in such territories."
