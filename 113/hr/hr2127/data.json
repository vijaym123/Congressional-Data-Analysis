Prohibits the Administrator, in proposing or finalizing any such rule, from combining in the same category of stationary sources: (1) an electric utility steam generating unit that is constructed for supplying more than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 25 megawatt net-electrical output to any utility power distribution system for sale, and (2) a combined cycle electric generating unit that is subject to standards of performance for stationary combustion turbines."
