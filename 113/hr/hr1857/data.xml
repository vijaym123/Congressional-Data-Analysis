  <summary>5/7/2013--Introduced.
Student-to-School Nurse Ratio Improvement Act of 2013 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make matching demonstration grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) in which the student-to-school nurse ratio in each of their public elementary and secondary schools is 750 or more students to every school nurse to reduce such ratio. Gives grant priority to LEAs: (1) for which not fewer than 10,000 or not less than 20% of the children served are from families with incomes below the poverty line, and (2) that demonstrate the greatest need for new or additional nursing services for their students.</summary>
