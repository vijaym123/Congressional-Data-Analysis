Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act of 2013 - Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from making grants to a state for specified child abuse or neglect prevention and treatment programs until the state's laws provide for a criminal punishment, including a prison term of at least 3,800 days, for any individual who: (1) is a parent or any other individual providing care to or supervision of a child under age 16; and (2) intentionally inflicts on that child any serious bodily injury, or commits an assault upon that child which results in any serious bodily injury or permanent or protracted loss or impairment of any of the child's mental or emotional function. Amends the federal criminal code to subject to penalties for domestic assault by an habital offender any person who commits three or more assaults, acts of sexual abuse, or serious violent felonies against a child of the person or in the person's care.</summary>
