Confidential Informant Accountability Act of 2013 - Directs the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of the Treasury to report biannually to Congress on all serious crimes, authorized and unauthorized, committed by informants maintained by the respective law enforcement agencies of such Departments (the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], the Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA], the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives [ATF]). Defines a "serious crime" as any serious violent felony or drug offense (as such terms are defined in the federal criminal code) or any offense of racketeering, bribery, child pornography, obstruction of justice, or perjury that an agent or employee of the relevant law enforcement agency has reasonable grounds to believe an informant has committed.</summary>
