  <summary>10/15/2013--Introduced.
United States-Iran Nuclear Negotiations Act - States that it is the policy of Congress that it is in the national security interest of the United States and its allies and partners to ensure that Iran: (1) halts all uranium enrichment and identifies all enrichment sites, (2) removes and transfers to a third party under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) all uranium enriched to a 20% and higher threshold, (3) closes the Fordow uranium enrichment facility, and (4) ceases developing reactors capable of producing plutonium and the importation and domestic manufacturing of all centrifuges for enriching uranium. Expresses the sense of Congress that if these objectives are met it shall be U.S. policy to enter into a negotiated settlement regarding nuclear activities in Iran. Declares that the United States is capable, willing, and ready to use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining or developing a nuclear weapons capability. Acknowledges that this Act constitutes current consultation with the President on Iran in order to provide for application of all options to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapons capability and provides consent to the appropriate use of force against legitimate targets in Iran to: (1) uphold and implement all relevant United Nations (U.N.) Security Council resolutions regarding Iran's nuclear program, (2) deter Iran's development of nuclear weapons in order to protect the national security interests of the United States and its allies and partners, and (3) degrade Iran's capacity to develop such weapons in the future. States that, if any business, firm, or entity has not terminated the provision of goods, services, or technology in Iran or with any Iranian-controlled entity, the President may: (1) prohibit that business, firm, or entity from receiving any U.S. government contract or accessing U.S. capital markets; and (2) in the case of a business, firm, or entity that is a foreign financial institution, prohibit or impose strict conditions on the opening or maintaining in the United States of a correspondent account or payable-through account.</summary>
