  <summary>3/21/2013--Introduced.
New Alternative Transportation to Give Americans Solutions Act of 2013 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow an excise tax credit through 2018 for alternative fuels and fuel mixtures involving compressed or liquefied natural gas, (2) allow an income tax credit through 2018 for alternative fuel motor vehicles powered by compressed or liquefied natural gas and make Indian tribal governments eligible for such credit, (3) modify the tax credit percentage for alternative fuel vehicles fueled by natural gas or liquefied natural gas, (4) allow a new tax credit for the production of vehicles fueled by natural gas or liquefied natural gas, and (5) extend through 2018 the tax credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property expenditures for refueling property relating to compressed or liquefied natural gas and allow an increased credit for such property. Requires the Secretary of Energy to provide funding to improve the performance, efficiency, and integration of natural gas powered motor vehicles and heavy-duty on-road vehicles. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to manufacturers of light and heavy duty natural gas vehicles for the development of engines that reduce emissions, improve performance and efficiency, and lower cost. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should streamline the process for certification of natural gas vehicle retrofit kits to promote energy security and provide incentives to encourage and reward manufacturers who produce natural gas powered vehicles. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to allocate funds for vehicles that are repowered or converted to operate on an alternative fuel.</summary>
