  <summary>5/23/2013--Introduced.
Ending VA Claims Disability Backlog and Accountability Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement the Strategic Plan to Eliminate the Compensation Claims Backlog (Plan) to ensure that, by Memorial Day (May 25) 2015, each VA disability claim is approved or denied within 125 days after its submission, with an accuracy rate of 98%. Requires a supplemental report from the Secretary to Congress on specific measures to assess implementation of the Plan and a detailed timeline to implement each initiative contained in the Plan. Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration and the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to ensure that such Commissioner and DOD Secretary transfer to the VA disability or medical records the VA Secretary will use to evaluate a disability claim by not later than 30 days after the VA Secretary requests such records. Requires the two Secretaries to submit to Congress, and implement, a plan to reduce to 30 days the time needed to provide members of the National Guard and the VA Secretary with the medical records of such members. Requires the VA Secretary to establish a three-year training program for newly-hired VA claims processors. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress every 90 days on the Secretary's progress in implementing the Plan.</summary>
