(Sec. 1002) Default Prevention Act of 2013 - Allows the President, within three days after enactment of this Act, to certify to Congress that absent a suspension of the public debt limit, the Secretary of the Treasury would be unable to issue debt to meet existing commitments. Suspends the debt limit for the period beginning on the date on which the President submits to Congress such a certification and ending on February 7, 2014. Increases the debt limit, effective February 8, 2014, to the extent that: the face amount of public debt obligations and those whose principal and interest are guaranteed by the U.S. government (except guaranteed obligations held by the Secretary of the Treasury) outstanding on such date exceeds the face amount of such obligations outstanding on the date of enactment of this Act. Excludes an obligation under the first clause (above) from being taken into account unless its issuance was necessary to fund a commitment incurred that required payment before February 8, 2014. Establishes procedures for congressional disapproval, by enactment of a joint resolution within 22 days after receipt of a certification by the President, of the exercise of authority to suspend the debt limit under this Act. Includes in such a measure an alternate debt limit suspension period. Provides for expedited consideration of such a joint resolution in the House and Senate."
