  <summary>10/16/2013--Public Law.
Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 - Division A: Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 - Makes continuing appropriations for FY2014. (Sec. 101) Appropriates amounts for continuing operations, projects, or activities which were conducted in FY2013 and for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were made available in: the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013 (division A of P.L. 113-6), except for a provision of such Act concerning movement of plant pests under a temporary permit; the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013 (division B of P.L. 113-6); the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2013 (division C of P.L. 113-6); the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013 (division D of P.L. 113-6); the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013 (division E of P.L. 113-6); and the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (division F of P.L. 113-6). Requires the rate for operations for each account to be calculated to reflect the full amount of any reduction required in FY2013 pursuant to: any provision of division G of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6); and the presidential sequestration order dated March 1, 2013, except as attributable to budget authority made available by: (1) the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175); or (2) the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2). (Sec. 102) Bars the use of Department of Defense (DOD) appropriations or funds made available or authority granted in this joint resolution for: (1) the new production of items not funded for production in FY2013 or prior years; (2) the increase in production rates above those sustained with FY2013 funds; (3) the initiation, resumption, or continuation of specified projects, activities, or operations for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were not available during FY2013; or (4) the initiation of multi-year procurements utilizing advance procurement funding for economic order quantity procurement unless specifically appropriated later. (Sec. 106) Provides funding under this joint resolution until whichever of the following first occurs: (1) enactment of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in it, (2) enactment of the applicable appropriations Act for FY2014 without any provision for such project or activity, or (3) January 15, 2014. (Sec. 109) Prohibits high initial rates of operation or complete distribution of appropriations at the beginning of FY2014 for those programs that would otherwise have them because of distributions of funding to states, foreign countries, grantees, or others. Prohibits also the awarding of grants for any programs funded by this joint resolution that would impinge on final funding prerogatives. (Sec. 110) Declares that this joint resolution shall be implemented so that only the most limited funding action permitted shall be taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities. (Sec. 111) Continues funding through January 15, 2014, at the FY2013 level for entitlements and other mandatory payments whose budget authority was provided in FY2013 appropriations Acts, as well as for activities under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008. (Sec. 112) Authorizes amounts made available under this joint resolution for civilian personnel compensation and benefits in each department and agency to be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to avoid furloughs, consistent with the applicable FY2013 appropriations Act. Prohibits use of this authority until after the department or agency has taken all necessary actions to reduce or defer non-personnel-related administrative expenses. (Sec. 114) Continues designation of each amount incorporated by reference in this joint resolution that was previously designated by Congress for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism or for disaster relief, respectively.
