States that this Act shall not be construed to restrict legal use (grazing, hunting, mining, or public-use recreational and backcountry airstrips) on land under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture. States that: (1) this Act shall have no effect on state or private lands, and shall not provide authority on or access to state or private lands; and (2) nothing in this Act supersedes, replaces, negates, or diminishes treaties or other agreements between the United States and Indian tribes."
