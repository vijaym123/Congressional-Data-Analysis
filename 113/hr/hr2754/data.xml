Collectible Coin Protection Act - Amends the Hobby Protection Act to make it a violation of such Act for a person to provide substantial assistance or support to any manufacturer, importer, or seller if that person knows or should have known that such manufacturer, importer, or seller has engaged in any act or practice that violates requirements for plainly identifying imitation political items or imitation coins and other numismatic items. Provides that if such a violation also involves the unauthorized use of registered trademarks belonging to a collectibles certification service, the owner of such trademarks shall also have all rights provided under appropriate provisions of the Trademark Act of 1946.</summary>
