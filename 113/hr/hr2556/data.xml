Requires the Director to select for each Center: (1) a manager, (2) an appropriate location, and (3) a particular industry to be the focus of its work. Requires the Director and each manager to jointly select a group of experts to: (1) identify and analyze existing and future cybersecurity challenges faced by the industry selected for the Center; (2) create cost-effective, repeatable, and scalable solutions; (3) collaborate, convene discussions, and share knowledge with individuals in that industry; and (4) create educational programs to promote best practices for such individuals. Directs each Center to: (1) work within the Cybersecurity Framework created pursuant to Executive Order 13636, entitled "Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity"; (2) collaborate with each of the other Centers; (3) encourage relationships among individuals in the industry selected for the Center; and (4) share best practices and lessons learned from the work of the Center with those individuals.
