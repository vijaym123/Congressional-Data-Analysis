Clear Creek National Recreation Area and Conservation Act - Establishes the Clear Creek National Recreation Area in California to promote environmentally responsible high-quality motorized and non-motorized trail based recreation, including off-highway vehicle use, scenic touring, and access for hunting and gem collecting, while protecting landscape resources. Instructs the Secretary to use the 2005 Clear Creek Management Area Travel Management Plan as modified by this Act or by the Secretary to incorporate natural resource protection information unavailable in 2005 as the basis for an interim management plan to govern motorized recreation in the Recreation Area. Requires the Secretary to create a comprehensive management plan for the Recreation Area within two years of enactment of this Act. Requires landowners to be provided with adequate access to inholdings within the Recreation Area. Permits livestock grazing to be allowed to continue in areas in which it is allowed. Designates specified federal lands in Fresno and San Benito Counties, California, to be known as the Joaquin Rocks Wilderness, as wilderness and as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to add the Larious Canyon, San Carlos Creek, Cantua Creek, Picacho Creek, and White Creek and its tributaries as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.</summary>
