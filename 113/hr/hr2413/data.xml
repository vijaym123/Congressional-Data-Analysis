  <summary>6/18/2013--Introduced.
Weather Forecasting Improvement Act of 2013 - Requires the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere (and also the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration [NOAA]) to make certain weather-related activities concerning public safety and the national economy the top priority in the planning and management of programs within all relevant NOAA line offices. Directs the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) to: (1) undertake a program to develop an improved understanding of forecast capabilities for atmospheric events; (2) establish a tornado warning extension program; and (3) issue a plan for restoring U.S. leadership in weather modeling, prediction, and forecasting. Requires the Under Secretary to: (1) develop a prioritized list of observation data requirements necessary to ensure weather forecasting capabilities to protect life and property; (2) undertake ongoing systematic evaluations of observing systems, data, and information needed to meet the requirements developed under such priority list; (3) identify current and potential future data gaps in observing capabilities related to such requirements; and (4) determine a range of options to address the gaps identified. Directs the OAR Assistant Administrator to undertake Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to assess the relative value and benefits of observing capabilities and systems. Allows technical and scientific OSSE evaluations to include assessments of the impact of observing capabilities on: (1) global weather prediction, (2) hurricane track and intensity forecasting, (3) tornado warning times and accuracy, and (4) prediction of mid-latitude severe local storm outbreaks. Requires OSSEs to: (1) determine the potential impact of proposed space-based, sub-orbital, and in-situ observing systems on analyses and forecasts; (2) evaluate and compare observing system design options; and (3) assess the relative capabilities and costs of various and combinations of observing systems in providing data necessary for the protection of life and property. Requires OSSEs to be conducted: (1) before the acquisition of major government-owned or government-leased operational observing systems, (2) before the purchase of new commercially provided data critical to forecast accuracy, and (3) for any existing commercially provided observing system data contracts exceeding $15 million. Permits OSSEs to be conducted on existing observing systems where such data costs NOAA in excess of $20 million. Requires NOAA to issue a specified plan for high performance computing support of its advanced research and operational weather prediction models. Permits: (1) the purchase of weather data through contracts with commercial providers, and (2) the placement of weather satellite instruments on co-hosted government or private payloads. Requires a report to Congress assessing the range of commercial opportunities for obtaining space-based weather observations and providing a plan for procuring data from those nongovernmental sources.</summary>
