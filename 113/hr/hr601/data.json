    "text": "Permanent Repeal of Oil Subsidies Act - United States Exploration on Idle Tracts Act or USE IT Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) issue regulations establishing a graduated annual production incentive fee governing federal onshore and offshore lands subject to an oil or natural gas production lease but for which such production is not occurring, and (2) deposit the prescribed fee assessment into the general fund of the Treasury. Deficit Reduction Through Fair Oil Royalties Act - Prohibits the Secretary from issuing new oil or natural gas production leases in the Gulf of Mexico under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to a person that does not renegotiate its existing leases in order to require royalty payments if oil and natural gas prices are greater than or equal to specified price thresholds. Authorizes the Secretary, in the case of multiple lessees, to implement a separate agreement modifying payment responsibilities (including such price thresholds) with any lessee that owns a lease share. Prescribes analogous requirements for lease transfers. Requires rentals or royalties received by the United States to be deposited in the Treasury for federal budget deficit reduction or, if there is no federal budget deficit, for reducing the federal debt. Directs the Secretary to agree to a lessee's request to amend any lease issued for any Central and Western Gulf of Mexico tract in the period of January 1, 1996, through November 28, 2000, to incorporate price thresholds applicable to royalty suspension requirements that are equal to or less than the price thresholds specified under OCSLA. No Free Inspections for Oil Companies Act - Amends the OCSLA to direct the Secretary to establish and collect nonrefundable facility inspection fees from operators of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) facilities. Establishes in the Treasury the Ocean Energy Enforcement Fund as depository for such fees. Requires amounts collected by the Secretary to be credited as offsetting collections and to be made available for expenditure only for implementing inspections of OCS facilities (including mobile offshore drilling units) and for administration of the inspection program."
