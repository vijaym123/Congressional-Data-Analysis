Requires the Secretary to: (1) determine the apportionment of such funds to each DOE national laboratory; (2) ensure that special consideration is given to small business firms and consortia involving such firms in the selection of which agreements will receive such funds; and (3) ensure that the performance evaluation metrics of each laboratory's operating contractor provide incentives for, and measure the effectiveness of, such contractor's cooperative research and development agreement program at maturing laboratory technology and transferring it to the private sector."
