Defines \"personal information\" to include an individual's Internet browsing history, device type and manufacturer, operating system, and Internet Protocol address. Directs the FTC to provide specific exceptions when consumers should reasonably expect a change in price based on their personal information, including for the calculation of shipping charges and financial services for which such information is customarily used to formulate a price. Deems a violation of a rule promulgated under this Act to be an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act."
