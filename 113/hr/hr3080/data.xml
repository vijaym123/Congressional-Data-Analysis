Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013 - Title I: Program Reforms and Streamlining - (Sec. 101) Revises requirements for feasibility studies initiated under the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986 to: (1) limit the duration of any feasibility study to 3 years; (2) limit the cost of any such study to $3 million; and (3) require personnel of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to conduct concurrent reviews of feasibility studies (currently, sequential reviews are permitted). Requires the Secretary of the Army, not later than 30 days after making a determination that a feasibility study cannot be conducted in compliance with such limitations, to: (1) prepare an updated feasibility schedule and cost estimates, (2) notify the nonfederal cost sharing partner that the feasibility study has been delayed, and (3) provide written notice to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works explaining the reasons for noncompliance. Terminates the authority for any feasibility study that is not completed within one year after the Secretary makes a determination of noncompliance. Requires the Secretary, within four years after the enactment of this Act, to report on: (1) the status of implementation of these limitations on feasibility studies, (2) the amount of time taken to complete each such feasibility study, and (3) any recommendations for additional authority to support efforts to expedite the feasibility study process. Requires the Secretary, not later than 90 days after the initiation of a feasibility study, to initiate federally-mandated reviews, including environmental reviews. (Sec. 102) Amends the WRDA of 2000 to authorize the Secretary to accept and expend funds contributed by a public utility company or natural gas company to expedite the evaluation of a permit for a water resources project or activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army. (Sec. 103) Sets forth U.S. policy with respect to the importance of water resources projects and studies and the need to coordinate and expedite environmental reviews of such projects. Amends the WRDA of 2007 to designate the Corps as the federal lead agency in the environmental review process (i.e., preparation of an environmental impact statement, environmental assessment, categorical exclusion, or other document under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [NEPA]) for a water resources project study. Requires the Corps to: (1) facilitate the expeditious resolution of the environmental review process and complete documents required by NEPA, (2) identify agencies that may have jurisdiction over a water resources project, (3) establish a plan for coordinating public and agency participation in and comment on the environmental review process for a project study, (4) identify issues of concern regarding the potential environmental or socioeconomic impacts of a project, and (5) prepare a condensed final environmental impact statement under NEPA. Requires the Secretary to survey the use by the Corps of categorical exclusions (i.e., a category of actions that do not have a significant effect on the human environment and do not require an environmental assessment or impact statement) in water resources projects. (Sec. 104) Repeals provisions of the WRDA of 1986 that require : (1) a reconnaissance study of a water resources project prior to initiating a feasibility study for such project, and (2) a review of the cost effectiveness of the design of a water resources project that has a total cost in excess of $10 million. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to: (1) expedite the completion of any ongoing feasibility study for a water resources project initiated before the enactment of this Act, and (2) proceed directly to preconstruction planning, engineering, and design of the project in accordance with the WRDA of 1986 if the Secretary determines that the project is justified. (Sec. 107) Requires the Secretary to establish a process for the review of section 14 applications in a timely and consistent manner. Defines "section 14 application" as an application submitted to the Secretary requesting permission for the temporary occupation or use of a public work or the alteration or permanent occupation or use of a public work. Requires the Secretary to establish benchmark goals for review of such applications, including a 45-day benchmark for approving or disapproving a completed application and a 180-day benchmark if a completed application requires more time to review due to the type, size, cost, complexity, or impacts proposed in the application. (Sec. 108) Amends the WRDA of 1996 to authorize nonfederal interests to undertake water resources development projects that are specifically authorized by Congress.
