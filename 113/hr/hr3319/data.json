Extends eligibility for such program to any qualified individual (i.e., any individual other than an individual who is enrolled or eligible to be enrolled in FEHB, including as a family member). Authorizes employers, under arrangements satisfactory to OPM, to: (1) offer their employees coverage under such program, and (2) make a contribution toward the cost of such coverage. Deems a health care plan under such program to be a plan offered through an Exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for purposes of complying with the individual mandate to purchase health insurance."
