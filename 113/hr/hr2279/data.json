    "text": "Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act of 2013 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to remove a requirement that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) review and revise regulations promulgated under such Act at least every three years. Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to prohibit the President from promulgating any financial responsibility requirement under such Act without first reporting on: each facility or class of facilities to be covered by such requirement; the development of such requirement, including why the facility or class proposed to be covered by such requirement presents the highest level of risk of injury and why they are not already covered by adequate financial responsibility requirements; financial responsibility requirements promulgated by state or other federal agencies for the facility or class to be covered by such proposed requirement; the exposure to the Hazardous Substances Superfund for response costs resulting from such proposed covered facilities; and the capacity of the financial and credit markets to provide instruments of financial responsibility necessary to meet such requirement. Requires the President to update such report to reflect any revision of the facilities or classes of facilities to be covered by a financial responsibility requirement. Requires an owner or operator of a facility or vessel that has already established evidence of financial responsibility associated with the production, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous substances under state law or any other federal law to establish evidence of financial responsibility under CERCLA only if the President determines that, in the event of a non-permitted release of hazardous substances, the existing financial responsibility requirements will not be sufficient to cover likely response costs."
