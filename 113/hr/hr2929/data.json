Allows: (1) a deduction from gross income for cash contributions to such accounts for the lesser of $10,000 or the compensation includible in the taxpayer's gross income for a taxable year, (2) an exclusion from gross income of amounts distributed from such accounts that are used by an account beneficiary to purchase a principal residence or make payments to such beneficiary's individual retirement account (IRA), and (3) a tax-free rollover of account funds into an IRA if an account beneficiary reaches age 55 or has maintained an account for 20 years without purchasing a residence."
