Prohibits the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from implementing or enforcing any requirement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or title I of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 until the Secretary of the Treasury certifies under penalty of perjury that: (1) taxpayer information is not and will not be used for targeting any individual or group for political reasons or on the basis of political views; and (2) the IRS has terminated the employment of all employees found to have violated the constitutional rights of any taxpayer or who knew of abuses related to the targeting of a political group, declined to come forward, or willfully misled investigators. Prohibits taxpayer information from being used for targeting any individual or group that provides information to the IRS for political reasons or on the basis of political views. Prohibits a federal agency from implementing or enforcing any requirement of PPACA or title 1 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 until the head of such agency certifies under penalty of perjury that the agency has terminated the employment of any employee who is found to have violated the constitutional rights of any taxpayer. Requires such certification to be submitted to Congress.</summary>
