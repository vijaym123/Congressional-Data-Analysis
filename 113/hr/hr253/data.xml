  <summary>6/17/2013--Passed House amended.
Y Mountain Access Enhancement Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), upon request by Brigham Young University, to convey an approximately 80-acre parcel of National Forest System land in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest in Utah. Requires the University to pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the fair market value of such land. Requires such consideration to be deposited in the general Treasury fund to reduce the federal deficit. Directs the University, after the conveyance, to represent that it will: (1) continue allowing the same reasonable public access to the trailhead, and the part of the Y Mountain Trail already owned by the University, as has been historically allowed; and (2) allow such access to the part of the Trail and the "Y" symbol located on the conveyed land. Requires the exact acreage and legal description of the conveyed land to be determined by a survey that is satisfactory to the Secretary. Requires Brigham Young University to pay the costs of the survey and appraisal and any administrative analyses required by law.</summary>
