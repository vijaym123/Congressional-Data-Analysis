  <summary>5/22/2013--Introduced.
Voter Registration Efficiency Act - Amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to require a state motor vehicle authority to require each individual applying for a motor vehicle driver's license in the state to: (1) indicate whether the individual resides in another state or resided in another state before applying for the license, and, if so, to identify the state involved; and (2) indicate whether the individual intends for the new state to serve as the individual's residence for federal voter registration purposes. Requires the motor vehicle authority, if an individual indicates an intention for the new state to serve as the individual's residence for federal voter registration purposes, to notify the motor vehicle authority of the former state of residence, which shall notify the chief state election official of that state that the individual no longer intends for it to serve as the individual's residence for federal voter registration purposes.</summary>
