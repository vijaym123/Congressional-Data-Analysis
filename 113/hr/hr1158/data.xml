  <summary>6/11/2013--Passed House without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the House reported version is repeated here.) North Cascades National Park Service Complex Fish Stocking Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to authorize the stocking of fish in lakes in the North Cascades National Park, Ross Lake National Recreation Area, and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area (the North Cascades National Park Service Complex). Authorizes the Secretary to allow stocking in not more than 42 of the 91 lakes which have historically been stocked with fish. Requires the Secretary to stock only fish that are: (1) native to the slope of the Cascade Range on which the lake to be stocked is located; and (2) non-reproducing, as identified in management alternative B of the North Cascades National Park Service Complex Mountain Lakes Fishery Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement (June 2008). Instructs the Secretary to take into consideration relevant scientific information, including such plan and the information gathered under the research and monitoring program specified below, in making fish stocking decisions under this Act. Requires the Secretary to coordinate the stocking of fish with the state of Washington. Requires the Secretary to continue, and report to Congress on, a program of research and monitoring of the impacts of fish stocking on the resources of the applicable unit of the North Cascades National Park Service Complex.</summary>
