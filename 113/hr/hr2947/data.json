Directs the Secretary of State to establish a women's rights Internet site and maintain prisoner lists and issue briefs on women's rights concerns. Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to include instruction on the internationally recognized rights of women and the various aspects and manifestations of violations of women's rights in Foreign Service officer training. Establishes the United States Commission on International Women's Rights. Directs the President to take specified actions in response to women's rights violations, especially particularly severe rights violations. Prescribes criteria for the prohibition of economic, multilateral, military, and export assistance in instances of particularly severe women's rights violations. Prescribes requirements for the promotion of women's rights. Requires women's rights-related training with respect to refugee, asylum, and consular matters. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to declare inadmissible to the United States any foreign government officials who have engaged in particularly severe women's rights violations. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) transnational corporations operating overseas should adopt codes of conduct upholding the rights of their female employees, and (2) there should be within the staff of the National Security Council a Special Adviser to the President on International Women's Rights."
