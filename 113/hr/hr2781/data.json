    "text": "Stop Paying Something for Nothing Act of 2013 - Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), by March 31 of each year, to report to the Chairs and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Budget Committees on: (1) each grant account exceeding three months past the grant end date; and (2) the total unexpended balance, the amount of obligated but unexpended funds, and the amount of unobligated funds in each such account for each agency. Requires the report to be made public on the OMB website. Requires rescission and return to the Tresury general fund, on the date of the report's submittal, of any unobligated amounts in an expired grant account not listed in the report. Requires the head of the relevant agency, within four months after a grant account is published on the OMB website, to close that grant account in the Payment Management System if the final report required by OMB Circular No. A-110 was filed more than 36 months before such date. Rescinds the unobligated amounts in such grant account and requires their return to the general fund. Requires an agency to close any grant account in the System that has no unexpended balance remaining for the previous six months and, by June 15 of each year, report to the Chairs and Ranking Members on each closed account. Authorizes OMB to prevent the closure of an account only after submitting to the Chairs and Ranking Members a report describing the reason for not closing the account."
