Naval Air Station Fallon Housing and Safety Development Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Navy, without consideration, approximately 400 acres of federal land that is adjacent to Naval Air Station Fallon in Churchill County, Nevada, and that was withdrawn under a specified public land order. Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as: (1) establishing a reservation that favors the United States respecting any water or water right on lands transferred by this Act, or (2) authorizing the appropriation of water on such lands except in accordance with applicable state law. Withdraws the federal land to be transferred under this Act from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws and geothermal leasing laws, so long as such land remains under the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Navy.</summary>
