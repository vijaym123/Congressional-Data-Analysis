  <summary>2/27/2013--Introduced.
Saving High-Tech Innovators from Egregious Legal Disputes Act of 2013 - Amends federal patent law, with respect to the remedies available in actions involving validity or infringement of a patent, to allow a party asserting invalidity or noninfringement to move for a judgment that the adverse party is not: (1) the inventor, a joint inventor, or in the case of a patent filed by, and awarded to, an assignee of the original inventor or joint inventor, the original assignee of the patent; (2) able to provide documentation of substantial investment made in the exploitation of the patent through production or sale of an item covered by the patent; or (3) an institution of higher education or a technology transfer organization. Directs courts making such a judgment to award the recovery of full costs to any prevailing party asserting invalidity or noninfringement, including reasonable attorney's fees, other than the United States, unless exceptional circumstances make an award unjust.</summary>
