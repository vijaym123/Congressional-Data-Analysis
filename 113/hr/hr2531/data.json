Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) any exceptions to such prohibition should identify the specific questions authorized, the class of taxpayers to whom such questions may be asked, and the circumstances under which such questions may be asked; and (2) if the IRS Commissioner determines that asking such questions would aid in the efficient administration of the tax laws, the Commissioner should submit a report to Congress that includes such questions in verbatim form and describes such class of taxpayers and circumstances."
