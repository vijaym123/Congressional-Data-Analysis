Makes such credit available to tax-exempt eligible small employers. Terminates such credit for wages paid after December 31, 2015. Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to: (1) determine, for a new small business concern, what SBA applications, submissions, or other paperwork are not essential to file during the first year of operation of such small business concern; and (2) make rules for the waiver of such filings."
