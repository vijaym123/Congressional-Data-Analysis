  <summary>3/14/2013--Introduced.
Provides that bond arbitrage requirements shall not apply to an issue of bonds that were partially defeased (made void) if: (1) such bonds are redeemed by the governmental issuer within 90 days of the sale of the escrow securities, and (2) any net profit remaining after the proceeds of the sale of the escrow securities have been applied to such redemption is used by the issuer for an essential governmental function within 12 months of such redemption. Makes this waiver applicable to bonds issued on January 4, 1990, that were partially defeased on July 19, 1996, with revenues of a municipally-owned electric and water system.</summary>
