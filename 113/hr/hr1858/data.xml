  <summary>5/7/2013--Introduced.
Congress Leads by Example Act of 2013 - Amends the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to grant the General Counsel of the Office of Compliance (OOC) subpoena authority for inspections and investigations in the legislative branch under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA). Subjects each employing office in the legislative branch to OSHA recordkeeping requirements. Prohibits retaliation by any employing office against an employee for requesting the OOC General Counsel to take authorized action related to, or for instituting or testifying in, any proceeding that arises from the application of OSHA to that office. Applies the whistleblower rights, protections, and remedies of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 to legislative branch employees, including those of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or the Library of Congress. Prohibits legislative branch employing offices from: (1) discharging any employee because the employee's earnings have been subjected to garnishment for any one indebtedness; or (2) denying or terminating the employment of, or otherwise discriminating against, an employee for being a debtor or a bankrupt under the bankruptcy code. Requires employing offices to retain records necessary to administer certain rights and protections of employees under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Requires each employing office to post conspicuously all notices describing the rights and protections applicable to its employees under federal law. Amends the federal judicial code to cover legislative branch employees under prohibitions and requirements protecting jurors' employment.</summary>
