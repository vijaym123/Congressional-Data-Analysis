  <summary>3/6/2013--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the preferential tax treatment of gains and losses from the sale of depreciable property used in a trade or business, to eliminate "horses" from the definition of "livestock" (thus making the 24-month holding period requirement for livestock inapplicable to horses and allowing horses to be treated as capital assets subject to the existing 1-year holding period requirement).</summary>
