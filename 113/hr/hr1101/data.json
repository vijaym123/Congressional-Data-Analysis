Requires the Secretary to implement a program that utilizes premiums from eligible state or multi-state plans to pre-fund future natural catastrophe recovery by making available for purchase, only by such plans, contracts for reinsurance coverage. Requires such contracts to cover insured property losses covered under primary insurance contracts to homeowners, mobile home owners, renters, and condominium owners for specified natural catastrophic events. Prescribes requirements for the operation of state plans and the terms of reinsurance contracts. Encourages states to create and maintain catastrophe funds for themselves or with other states. Sets forth requirements for the treatment of insured losses and maximum federal liability. Establishes in the Treasury the Catastrophe Preparedness Fund, consisting of contract sales receipts and any amounts borrowed or earned, which shall be used to pay Commission administrative costs and loss payments under reinsurance contracts. Prohibits the authorization or appropriation of federal funds for the Fund or for implementing the reinsurance liquidity protection program. Establishes a post-catastrophe market stabilization program for liquidity loans to: (1) expedite payment of claims under state catastrophe insurance programs, (2) authorize the Secretary to issue loans to assist financial recovery from significant natural catastrophes, and (3) promote the availability of private capital to state catastrophe insurance programs in order to provide liquidity and capacity. Establishes the National Readiness, Preparedness and Mitigation Committee to administer a Readiness, Preparedness, and Mitigation Grant Program of grants to state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and other appropriate public and private entities to develop programs and initiatives to improve catastrophe response, citizen preparedness and protection, and prevention and mitigation of losses from natural catastrophes."
