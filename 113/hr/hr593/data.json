    "text": "Down Payment to Protect National Security Act of 2013 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) full sequestration must be averted, (2) balanced deficit reduction must include substantive reductions in mandatory spending, and (3) any plan to avert sequestration and provide time for political negotiations on a balanced deficit reduction package must use additional savings that do not increase the risk to military personnel or degrade the capabilities of the Armed Forces by reshaping the federal civilian workforce without furloughs. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to determine the number of full-time employees employed in each federal agency. Prohibits a federal agency head from hiring more than 1 employee for every 3 full-time employees who leave employment in such agency until the OMB Director makes a determination that the number of full-time federal employees is 10% less than the initial level as determined by OMB. Allows a waiver of such workforce limitation by the President for national security reasons or in the case of an extraordinary emergency. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), as amended by the Budget Control Act of 2011, to offset mandatory sequestration in security and nonsecurity categories with revenues resulting from reductions in the federal workforce and the pay freeze under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to transfer amounts appropriated for DOD by the Continuing Appropriations Resolution (P.L. 112-175) among accounts of DOD. Prohibits a cost-of-living adjustment to the pay of Members of Congress in any year in which there is a budget deficit."
