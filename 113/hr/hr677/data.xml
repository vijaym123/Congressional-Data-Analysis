  <summary>2/13/2013--Introduced.
Inter-Affiliate Swap Clarification Act - Amends the Commodity Exchange Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, to exempt from certain regulatory requirements any swaps and security-based swaps entered into by parties neither of which is a swap dealer or a major swap participant: (1) that is also an insured depository institution, (2) that reports information or prepares financial statements on a consolidated basis, or (3) for which a company affiliated with both parties reports information or prepares financial statements on a consolidated basis. Requires that such exempted agreements, contracts, or transactions be reported to an appropriate data repository, or, if there is no such repository that would accept them, to: (1) the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the case of exempted swaps, or (2) the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the case of exempted security-based swaps.</summary>
