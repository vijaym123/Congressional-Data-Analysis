  <summary>7/24/2013--Introduced.
Medicare Patient Access and Quality Improvement Act of 2013 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) repeal sustainable growth rate (SGR) methodology from the determination of annual conversion factors in the formula for payment for physicians' services; and (2) prescribe an update to the single conversion factor for 2014 through 2018, as well as 2019 all subsequent years, of 0.5%. Requires the update for a year beginning with 2019 to be adjusted by the applicable determined quality adjustment for any eligible professional who does not have a payment arrangement (eligible professional quality update incentive program). Prescribes requirements for core measure sets as well as quality measures for them. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish: (1) an eligible professional quality update incentive program meeting specified criteria, and (2) one or more methods to assess an eligible professional's performance with respect to quality measures and clinical practice improvement activities. Amends SSA title XVIII part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) to require payment for covered professional services furnished by an eligible professional under a specified Alternative Payment Model (APM) to be made under Medicare in accordance with the payment arrangement under such model. Directs the Secretary to establish a process to implement eligible APMs. Sets forth requirements for: (1) expanding uses of Medicare data by qualified entities; (2) promoting care coordination and Medicare homes; (3) soliciting recommendations on non-acute episodes of care definitions; and (4) establishing a physician reporting system to improve the accuracy of relative values, such as data relating to service volume and time.</summary>
