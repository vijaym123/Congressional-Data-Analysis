Requires such review to include: (1) how federal policy should interact with state laws that make marijuana legal for such use; (2) the cost of the prohibition and potential regulation of marijuana and the potential revenue generated by taxation of marijuana; (3) the impact of federal banking and tax laws on businesses operating in compliance with state laws related to marijuana; (4) the health impacts related to marijuana use, and in comparison to alcohol and tobacco use; (5) the public safety effects and impact of the prohibition, and the regulation and control, of marijuana; (6) the impact of marijuana prohibition on criminal justice and the collateral consequences of prosecution for marijuana possession; (7) recommendations for the appropriate placement of marijuana in the schedule of the Controlled Substances Act; and (8) the effects of the prohibition or future regulation and control of marijuana on international relationships and treaty obligations."
