  <summary>4/18/2013--Introduced.
National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy Act of 2013 - Establishes the National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy to undertake a comprehensive review of current policies of the federal government toward marijuana in light of the growing number of states in which marijuana is legal for medicinal or personal use. Requires such review to include: (1) how federal policy should interact with state laws that make marijuana legal for such use; (2) the cost of the prohibition and potential regulation of marijuana and the potential revenue generated by taxation of marijuana; (3) the impact of federal banking and tax laws on businesses operating in compliance with state laws related to marijuana; (4) the health impacts related to marijuana use, and in comparison to alcohol and tobacco use; (5) the public safety effects and impact of the prohibition, and the regulation and control, of marijuana; (6) the impact of marijuana prohibition on criminal justice and the collateral consequences of prosecution for marijuana possession; (7) recommendations for the appropriate placement of marijuana in the schedule of the Controlled Substances Act; and (8) the effects of the prohibition or future regulation and control of marijuana on international relationships and treaty obligations.</summary>
