Requires the Secretary of Defense (DOD), when System operations are suspended, to assume responsibility for the security of System databases. Suspends sanctions against persons failing to register under the System, unless such failure occurs during a national emergency. Permits the authorization of appropriations under the Military Selective Service Act only during periods of national emergency.</summary>
