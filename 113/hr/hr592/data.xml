  <summary>2/13/2013--Passed House without amendment.
Federal Disaster Assistance Nonprofit Fairness Act of 2013 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to include community centers, including tax-exempt houses of worship, as "private nonprofit facilities" for purposes of disaster relief and emergency assistance eligibility under such Act. Makes a church, synagogue, mosque, temple, or other house of worship, and a private nonprofit facility operated by a religious organization, eligible for federal contributions for the repair, restoration, and replacement of facilities damaged or destroyed by a major disaster, without regard to the religious character of the facility or the primary religious use of the facility. Makes this Act applicable to the provision of assistance in response to a major disaster or emergency declared on or after October 28, 2012.</summary>
