  <summary>1/23/2013--Introduced.
Congressional Halt in Pay Increases and Cut Congressional Pay Act - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to provide that, as of the beginning of the first applicable pay period commencing after the next regularly scheduled general election for federal office following the enactment of this Act, the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress shall be equal to the annual rate of pay for that position as of the date on which that general election is held, reduced by 10%. (Thus eliminates the automatic pay adjustments for Members of Congress, and reduces their compensation by 10%.)</summary>
