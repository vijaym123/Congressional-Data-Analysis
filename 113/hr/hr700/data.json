Requires the Secretary to appoint to the ARPA-ED, for terms of up to four years, individuals who have expertise in carrying out the Agency's objectives. Requires the ARPA-ED to: (1) identify and promote advances in learning, fundamental and applied sciences, and engineering that may be translated into new learning technologies; (2) develop, test, and evaluate new learning technologies and related processes; and (3) accelerate transformational technological advances in education. Directs the Secretary to award grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, or cash prizes to, or enter into other transactions with, public or private entities in pursuit of these objectives. Directs the Secretary to: (1) convene an advisory panel to provide the Secretary and the ARPA-ED with advice in making those awards or entering into those transactions; (2) obtain independent, periodic, and rigorous evaluations of the ARPA-ED's effectiveness; and (3) disseminate information to education practitioners on effective practices and technologies developed through the ARPA-ED."
