    "text": "Stabilization and Reconstruction Integration Act of 2013 - Establishes as an independent entity the United States Office for Contingency Operations (Office), which shall report to the Department of Defense (DOD) and the State Department. Requires the Director of such Office, among other duties, to: (1) monitor political and economic instability worldwide in order to anticipate the need for mobilizing U.S. and international assistance for the stabilization and reconstruction of a foreign country or region that is at risk of, in, or in transition from, conflict or civil strife; (2) develop contingency plans and procedures to mobilize and deploy civilian and military personnel to conduct appropriate foreign stabilization and reconstruction operations (operations); (3) aid the President in preparing rules and regulations relating to the planning, coordination, and execution of such operations; and (4) evaluate, and report to Congress on, the impact of such operations. Authorizes the President: (1) upon finding that circumstances and U.S. security interests so require, to declare that a stabilization and reconstruction emergency exists and to determine the geographic extent and the date of commencement of such emergency; and (2) to terminate such declaration upon determining that such emergency no longer exists. Gives the Director sole control over such operations conducted during a stabilization and reconstruction emergency. Requires the Director to: (1) coordinate with the Secretary of Defense and commanders of unified and specified combatant commands regarding Office plans or activities for operations, and (2) prescribe a Stabilization Federal Acquisition Regulation. Establishes the Stabilization and Reconstruction Fund. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Director and Office staff should partner with the country in which an operation is taking place, other foreign government partners, international organizations, and local nongovernmental organizations throughout the planning, implementation, and the transition stages of such operations in order to facilitate long term capacity building and sustainability of initiatives. Sets forth the duties of the Inspector General of the Office, including special audit and investigative authority and reporting requirements. Provides information coordination responsibilities of other federal agencies with respect to Office monitoring and evaluation requirements."
