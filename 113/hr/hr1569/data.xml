  <summary>4/15/2013--Introduced.
New Fair Deal Busting America's Rigid Outdated &amp; Needless Subsidies Act of 2013 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal: (1) the excise tax credits for alcohol fuel, biodiesel, and alternative fuel mixtures; (2) the tax credits for the purchase of alternative motor vehicles and new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles; (3) the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property tax credit; (4) the income tax credits for alcohol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel used as fuel; (5) the enhanced oil recovery tax credit and the tax credit for producing oil and gas from marginal wells; (6) the tax credits for producing electricity from renewable resources and from advanced nuclear power facilities; (7) the tax credit for carbon dioxide sequestration; (8) the energy tax credit; and (9) the tax credits for investment in qualifying advanced coal projects and qualifying gasification projects. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe a flat income tax rate for corporations, in lieu of the existing marginal tax rates, based upon the overall revenue savings from the repeal of energy tax expenditures by this Act.</summary>
