  <summary>6/6/2013--Introduced.
National Mall Designation and Revitalization Act - Authorizes the National Capital Planning Commission (the Commission) to modify the boundaries of Areas I and II of the National Mall in the District of Columbia reserved for the location of commemorative works of preeminent historical and lasting significance to the United States. Prohibits any review of such a decision. Requires the Commission to notify the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of General Services (GSA), the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, and certain congressional committees of any boundary modification made under such authority. Allows the Secretary or the Administrator to submit a recommendation to Congress that the legislative authority for a commemorative work be terminated before its expiration date, if the person authorized to establish the work does not possess the capacity or resources to complete successfully the project for the establishment of the work before that expiration date. Directs: (1) the Commission to prepare recommendations for improving upon the process required for the selection, design, and subject matter of commemorative works in the District of Columbia and its environs; and (2) the Secretary to submit a plan to enhance cultural experiences in, and visitor enjoyment, amenities, and the vitality of, the National Mall.</summary>
