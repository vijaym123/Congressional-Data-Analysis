  <summary>7/8/2013--Introduced.
Public Buildings Savings and Reform Act of 2013 - Sets forth new requirements for the purchase or lease of federal office space, for limiting rental costs for such space, and for suspending the construction of new courthouses. Requires that the acquisition in FY2014-2017 of new federal office space through lease or purchase be offset by the elimination of at least a corresponding amount of space. Prohibits the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) from increasing the size or amount of its real property inventory as compared to the FY2012 real property baseline, except for space offsets specifically identified or for emergency or national security purposes. Requires the Administrator to include in the prospectus submitted to Congress for a proposed federal building a justification for such space. Requires the Inspector General of GSA to review the Public Buildings Service (PBS) internship program, recent graduate program, and similar programs and report on costs associated with each program and related matters. Suspends the payment of any bonus, performance award, or similar expenditure for Senior Executive Service (SES) employees until the Administrator reports to Congress on the PBS system for awarding bonuses and performance awards. Requires the Administrator to report on: (1) leases of federal office space, (2) conferences to be hosted by PBS, (3) PBS administrative expenses, (4) utilization rates of owned and leased public buildings, (5) any increase or decrease of 5% or more in the cost of public projects, and (6) PBS acquisition activities that conserve existing resources and reduce costs.</summary>
