  <summary>3/6/2013--Introduced.
Rescinds $2.2 billion from the unobligated balances of funds available to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for salaries and expenses for FY2013. Prohibits the funds made available to the FCC for FY2013 salaries and expenses from being used for the Lifeline program (a program that provides discounts on telephone service to qualifying low-income consumers). Increases the FY2013 amounts otherwise made available to: (1) the Department of Transportation (DOT) for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations by $500 million, and (2) the Department of Defense (DOD) for Navy operation and maintenance by $1.6 billion.</summary>
