  <summary>4/19/2013--Reported to House amended.
Helping Sick Americans Now Act - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to transfer from the Prevention and Public Health Fund any unobligated funds which are attributable to FY2013 and any funds that would otherwise be made available to the Fund for FY2014-FY2016 to a Department of Health and Human Services account to carry out the temporary high risk health insurance pool program (a program to provide health insurance coverage to eligible individuals with a preexisting condition). Requires such funds to be available for obligation on the date of enactment of this Act and to remain available through December 31, 2013. Eliminates the eligibility requirement for the temporary high risk pool which prohibits an individual from having creditable coverage (health coverage) for six months before applying for coverage through the pool. Requires the Secretary to administer the temporary high risk pool in accordance with current regulations governing the operation of the pool, except as necessary to reflect amendments made by this Act.</summary>
