Requires such funds to be available for obligation on the date of enactment of this Act and to remain available through December 31, 2013. Eliminates the eligibility requirement for the temporary high risk pool which prohibits an individual from having creditable coverage (health coverage) for six months before applying for coverage through the pool. Requires the Secretary to administer the temporary high risk pool in accordance with current regulations governing the operation of the pool, except as necessary to reflect amendments made by this Act."
