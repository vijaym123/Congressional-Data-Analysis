  <summary>6/11/2013--Introduced.
Federal Facility Accountability Act of 2013 - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to make all guidelines, rules, regulations, and criteria applicable to response actions (currently, preliminary assessments) for facilities at which hazardous substances are located applicable to facilities which are or have been owned or operated by the United States in the same manner and to the extent that they are applicable to other facilities. Requires federal facilities to comply with state substantive and procedural requirements regarding response relating to hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants, including state hazardous waste requirements, in the same manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity. Waives sovereign immunity with respect to state substantive or procedural requirements. Prohibits an agent, employee, or officer of the United States from being: (1) immune or exempt from injunctive relief with respect to such state requirements, and (2) personally liable for any civil penalty under such requirements or CERCLA with respect to any act or omission within the scope of their official duties. Subjects an agent, employee, or officer of the United States to any criminal sanction under such state requirements or CERCLA. Prohibits any department, agency, or instrumentality of the federal government from being subject to any such sanction. Provides that state substantive and procedural requirements include administrative orders, injunctive relief, civil and administrative penalties and fines, reasonable service charges or oversight costs, and laws or regulations requiring the imposition and maintenance of engineering or land use controls. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review as determined necessary, or upon state request, actions taken or regulations promulgated pursuant to any duties or powers delegated or assigned by the President to a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States other than EPA to ensure consistency with the guidelines, rules, regulations, or criteria established by the Administrator.</summary>
