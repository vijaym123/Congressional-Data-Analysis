  <summary>1/3/2013--Introduced.
Small Supplier Fairness in Bidding Competition Act of 2013 - Amends part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits for Aged and Disabled) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to repeal the Medicare competitive acquisition program for durable medical equipment and prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS). Requires the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to report to Congress on the impact of competitive bidding on small clinical laboratories. Includes CMS (solely with respect to its capacity to issue rules governing the Medicare part B fee schedule for clinical laboratory services) as an agency for purposes of the requirement to assure the opportunity for participation of small entities in the making of rules that will have a significant economic impact on them.</summary>
