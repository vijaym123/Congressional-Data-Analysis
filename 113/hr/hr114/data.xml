Online Job Training Act of 2013 - Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to require the Secretary of Labor to award National Online Workforce Training Grants for workforce training programs using distance-learning technologies, such as the Internet. Requires such grants to be awarded on a competitive basis to educational institutions, community-based organizations, nonprofit organizations, state or local boards, or units of general local government that provide online workforce training. Directs the Secretary to award one grant to an eligible postsecondary educational institution to: (1) provide technical assistance to entities that receive grants, (2) collect and nationally disseminate the data gathered by entities that receive grants, and (3) disseminate best practices.</summary>
