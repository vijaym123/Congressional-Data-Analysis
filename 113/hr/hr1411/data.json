    "text": "California Coastal National Monument Expansion Act of 2013 - Expands the boundary of the California Coastal National Monument, established by Presidential Proclamation 7264, to include the Point Arena-Stornetta public lands in Mendocino County, California. Requires management of such lands in accordance with such Proclamation, and as part of the Monument, except that: (1) traditional economic activities and existing uses, such as grazing and maintenance of existing structures used for grazing, shall not be restricted; and (2) lands and interests in land within the proposed land addition not owned by the federal government shall not become part of the Monument, and the future acquisition of such lands and interests by the government may only occur through donation or exchange with the landowner's written consent. Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to finalize an amendment to the Monument's management plan for the long-term protection and management of the lands added to the Monument under this Act. Requires the plan amendment to be developed with an opportunity for full public participation. Permits the use of motorized and mechanized vehicles in the Monument only on roads and trails designated for such use, except as needed for emergency or authorized administrative purposes. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire non-federal land or interests within or adjacent to the land added to the Monument only through exchange, or donation with the landowner's written consent. Bars the inclusion of non-federal land within the boundaries of the Monument without such consent. Requires any such acquired land or interests to be added to and administered as part of the Monument. Prohibits the addition of lands to the Monument under this Act from resulting in a lack of or restricted access by motorized vehicle to any non-federal lands within the Monument. Declares that nothing in this Act: (1) restricts or precludes low-level military, commercial, and general aviation overflights; (2) affects law enforcement authorities of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); (3) enlarges, diminishes, or modifies the rights of any Indian tribes and Indian religious communities; or (4) affects livestock grazing and the maintenance of existing structures used for grazing with the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands or the Monument. States that: (1) the expansion of the Monument is not intended to lead to the establishment of protective perimeters and buffer zones around the land included in the Monument by this Act; and (2) the fact that activities outside the Monument can be seen or heard within the land added to the Monument by this Act shall not, of itself, preclude those activities or uses up to the Monument's boundary. Requires management of the Monument as part of the National Landscape Conservation System."
