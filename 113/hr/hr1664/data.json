    "text": "Distracted Driving Prevention Act of 2013 - Requires the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to withhold a certain percentage of a state's apportionment of certain federal-aid highway funds for FY2016-FY2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, if the state has not enacted or is not enforcing a law that: (1) prohibits a driver from using a hand-held personal wireless communications device (such as a cell phone or smart phone) to text or call while driving; (2) allows the use of a hands-free device by a driver (other than a driver who is less than 18 years old) to call; (3) makes violation of the law a primary offense; (4) requires distracted driving issues to be tested as part of the state's driver's license examination; and (5) establishes certain minimum fines and increased civil and criminal penalties. Excludes from the meaning of personal wireless communications device a global navigation satellite system receiver used for positioning, emergency notification, or navigation (GPS). Declares that laws meet the requirements of this Act without regard to whether it provides exceptions for driver: (1) use of a cell phone in emergency situations, and (2) use of a cell phone to activate its hands-free capabilities. Requires the Secretary to establish a research program to study distracted driving by passenger and commercial vehicle drivers. Directs the the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to report to Congress on existing and developing wireless communications technology that may be used to reduce problems associated with distracted driving."
