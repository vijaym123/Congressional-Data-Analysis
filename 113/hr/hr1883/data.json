Defines \"secure gun storage or safety device\" as: (1) a device that, when installed on a firearm, is designed to prevent the firearm from being operated; or (2) a safe, gun safe, gun case, lock box, or other device used to store a firearm that can only be unlocked by a key, a combination, or other similar means. Terminates such deduction after 2014. Requires that an amount equal to all amounts allowed as a deduction by this Act be rescinded each year from the Department of Justice (DOJ) Assets Forfeiture Fund."
