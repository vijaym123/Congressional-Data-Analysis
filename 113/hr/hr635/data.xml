Help Establish Access to Local Timely Healthcare for Your Vets Act of 2013 or HEALTHY Vets Act of 2013 - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in the case of a veteran for whom Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities are geographically inaccessible (as defined under this Act), to contract for the provision of the following care: (1) primary care; (2) acute or chronic symptom management; (3) nontherapeutic medical services; and (4) other medical services determined appropriate by the director of the appropriate VA service region, after consultation with the VA physician responsible for such veteran's primary care. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such requirement upon demonstrating, on an individual basis, that the costs of providing the contract care significantly outweigh the benefits of localized health care.</summary>
