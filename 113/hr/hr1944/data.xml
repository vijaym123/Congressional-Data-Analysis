  <summary>5/9/2013--Introduced.
Private Property Rights Protection Act of 2013 - Prohibits a state or political subdivision from exercising its power of eminent domain, or allowing the exercise of such power by delegation, over property to be used for economic development or over property that is used for economic development within seven years after that exercise, if the state or political subdivision receives federal economic development funds during any fiscal year in which the property is so used or intended to be used. Prohibits the federal government from exercising its power of eminent domain for economic development. Establishes a private cause of action for any private property owner or tenant who suffers injury as a result of a violation of this Act. Prohibits state immunity in federal or state court. Sets the statute of limitations at seven years. Requires the Attorney General (DOJ) to bring an action to enforce this Act in certain circumstances, but prohibits an action brought later than seven years following the conclusion of any condemnation proceedings. Requires the Attorney General to disseminate to states and the public information on: (1) the rights of property owners and tenants under this Act, and (2) the federal laws under which federal economic development funds are distributed. Prohibits the federal government, or a state or political subdivision receiving federal economic development funds during any fiscal year, from exercising the power of eminent domain over property of a religious or other nonprofit organization because of the organization's nonprofit or tax-exempt status or any related quality. Directs the Attorney General, if a court determines that a violation of this Act has a disproportionately high impact on the poor or minorities, to make efforts to locate former owners and tenants to inform them of the violation and any possible remedies.</summary>
