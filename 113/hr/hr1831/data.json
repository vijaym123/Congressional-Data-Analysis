    "text": "Read the Bills Act - Requires any bill or resolution introduced in either chamber of Congress to contain a provision citing the specific powers granted to Congress in the Constitution to enact the proposed measure, including all of its provisions. Requires any measure introduced in either chamber, designed to amend or modify the effect of, or which would have such an effect, any current provision of law, including its expiration date, to set forth: (1) the amendments being proposed by the bill; and (2) the current section of law as it would read as modified by such amendments, showing deleted text struck through and inserted text underlined. Prohibits the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate from accepting legislation if it is noncompliant with these requirements. Applies such requirements to any legislation presented for consideration on the floor of either chamber. Prohibits any noncompliant measure from being submitted for a vote on final passage. Prohibits either chamber of Congress jointly from waiving or modifying these requirements. Requires any amendment to a measure introduced in either chamber to set forth the current section of the legislation as it would read as modified by the amendment, showing deleted text struck through and inserted text underlined. Sets forth the same requirements and/or prohibitions for such amendments as those specified in this Act regarding the text of legislation setting forth current law. Bars a vote on final passage of a measure (except private bills) from occurring in either chamber, unless: (1) the full text of the measure, or original language and all adopted amendments to the same effect, is published at least seven days before the vote on the official public Internet website of the Office of the Clerk or the Office of the Secretary, as appropriate; and (2) public notice of the specific calendar week during which the vote is scheduled to take place is posted on the respective website within six days before the Monday of such week. Requires a roll call vote on final passage of a measure (except a private bill) in either chamber. Excludes from these requirements any measure which constitutes a declaration of war. Declares that an Act of Congress noncompliant with this Act shall have no force or effect. Bars any legal, equitable, regulatory, civil, or criminal action from being brought under such Act. Grants the following aggrieved individuals the right to bring an action against the United States to seek appropriate relief, including an injunction against the enforcement of any law, the passage of which did not conform to this Act: (1) persons aggrieved by an action of any federal officer or employee, and (2) Members of Congress."
