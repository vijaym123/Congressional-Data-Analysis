    "text": "STEM Education Opportunity Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) individual taxpayers a deduction from gross income for STEM (i.e., science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) higher education expenses; and (2) a business-related tax credit for contributions of STEM\u00a0property (e.g., computer equipment\u00a0and software, microscopes, and lab equipment), services, and training\u00a0made to an elementary or secondary school\u00a0to promote education in the biological sciences, mathematics, earth and physical sciences, computer and information science, engineering, geosciences, and social and behavioral sciences. Defines \"STEM higher education expenses\" to include any expenses incurred by an individual attending an institution of higher education who is majoring in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Requires the Comptroller General (GAO) to submit to Congress a report detailing: (1) the efficacy of this Act in increasing higher education enrollment in the fields of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology; and (2) any effect\u00a0this Act has had on the price of higher education tuition in such fields."
