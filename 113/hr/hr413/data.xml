  <summary>1/23/2013--Introduced.
Amends the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 to eliminate the two-year delay (until January 1, 2016) of the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement oral-only End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)-related drugs in the ESRD prospective payment system (PPS) under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act. (Thus authorizes the Secretary to implement such drugs in the ESRD-PPS immediately.)</summary>
