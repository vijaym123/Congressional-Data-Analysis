Requires each plan to include measures to: (1) maximize tree cover on federal property; and (2) increase solar reflectivity through techniques such as using roofs with high solar reflectivity (cool roofs), vegetated roofs, and paving materials with higher solar reflectivity. Requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to submit annual reports to specified congressional committees assessing agency progress in developing and implementing such plans."
