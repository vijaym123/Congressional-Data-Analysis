Defines \"cybersecurity mission\" as threat and vulnerability reduction, deterrence, incident response, resiliency, and recovery activities to foster the security and stability of cyberspace. Directs the DHS Chief Human Capital Officer and Chief Information Officer to assess the readiness and capacity of DHS to meet such mission. Requires the Secretary to provide Congress with annual updates regarding such strategies, assessments, and training."
