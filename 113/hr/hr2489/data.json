Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to transfer certain land identified as proposed addition lands to the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) and adjust the boundary of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest to exclude such lands transferred by the Secretary. Directs the Secretaries to accept the donation of a grazing lease or permit from a lessee or permittee for the Big Grayback Grazing Allotment located in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest or the Billy Mountain Grazing Allotment located on a parcel of BLM-managed land. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate the subterranean segment of the Cave Creek in Oregon known as the River Styx as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers system and certain additional segments of the Monument and Preserve for study for potential addition to the system."
