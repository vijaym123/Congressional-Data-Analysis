    "text": "Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range Transfer Act of 2013 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Navy administrative jurisdiction over certain public lands in Imperial and Riverside Counties, California, for inclusion within the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range. Withdraws the mineral estate of such land from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws and the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, for as long as the land is under the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Navy. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to prepare an integrated natural resources management plan with respect to the transferred lands. Requires the Secretary of the Navy, upon determining that there is no longer a military need for the lands transferred, to transfer such lands back to the Secretary of the Interior. Requires appropriate land decontamination preceding the retransfer. Amends the California Military Lands Withdrawal and Overflights Act of 1994 to extend a land withdrawal and reservation period consistent with the above transfer. Provides that nothing in this Act shall affect existing water rights on the transferred lands."
