  <summary>8/2/2013--Introduced.
Providing Relief to Individuals Desiring Employment (PRIDE) Act of 2013 - Amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, effective as of October 1, 2013, to direct the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to carry out pilot projects to permit states to run a work program (with certain features comparable to the program of block grants for temporary assistance for needy families under title IV of the Social Security Act) to increase employment and self-sufficiency through increased accountability (thereby reducing the need for supplemental nutrition assistance benefits (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program)).</summary>
