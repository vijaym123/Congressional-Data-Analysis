(Currently, the Chief Justice designates all 11 judges.) Requires a majority of the Supreme Court (currently, the Chief Justice alone) to designate three judges from the U.S. district courts or courts of appeals who shall comprise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. Requires the Attorney General (DOJ) to make publicly available: (1) copies of FISA court decisions, orders, pleadings, applications, and memoranda currently submitted to Congress, subject to the authority of the Attorney General to waive such public availability requirements for national security purposes; and (2) a quarterly estimate of the number of waivers along with the reasons for such waivers."
