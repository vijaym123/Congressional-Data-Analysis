Authorizes state governors to request that the Administrator declare a severe marine debris event for such purpose. Requires the Administrator, within 30 days after receiving such request, to either declare such an event or provide a response explaining why not. Requires the Administrator to encourage grant recipients to: (1) educate staff and volunteers engaged in response efforts on the potential threats that marine debris and marine invasive species may pose, and (2) coordinate marine debris response efforts with appropriate entities. Defines \"marine invasive species\" to mean a marine nonindigenous species the introduction of which to the United States will, or is likely to: (1) cause economic or environmental harm; (2) threaten the diversity or abundance of native species or the ecological stability of infested waters; or (3) disrupt commercial, agricultural, aquacultural, or recreational activities dependent on infested waters."
