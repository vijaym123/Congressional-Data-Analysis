  <summary>3/21/2013--Introduced.
Catching Up To 1968 Act of 2013 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase to $10.50 an hour (adjusted annually based on increases in the Consumer Price Index) the federal minimum wage for employees. Prescribes the federal minimum wage for tipped employees to be 70% of the federal minimum wage in effect for employees. Directs the Secretary of Labor, 60 days before any increase in the minimum wage, to publish the increase in the Federal Register and on the Department of Labor's website. Revises the exemption from minimum wage and maximum hour requirements of agricultural employees to eliminate (and so subject to such requirements) all agricultural employees except those who are members of the employer's immediate family. Eliminates from that same exemption (and thereby subject to such requirements) any employee employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for individuals who because of age or infirmity are unable to care for themselves.</summary>
