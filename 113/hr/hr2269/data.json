Requires the Director of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services to give preferential consideration to an application for a grant for such an activity from a jurisdiction that demonstrates that: (1) the activity will cover a significant number of schools, (2) such jurisdiction uses (or will use such grant to develop) an electronic record management system that is compatible across multiple jurisdictions, or (3) there is community interest with respect to such activity. Reauthorizes such Program for FY2014-FY2017."
