District of Columbia Chief Financial Officer Vacancy Act - Amends the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to require the District of Columbia Treasurer (who is a Deputy Chief Financial Officer) to serve as acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in the event that there is a vacancy in the Office of Chief Financial Officer because the CFO has died, resigned, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the Office. Authorizes the Mayor, as an alternative to the District of Columbia Treasurer, to direct another Deputy CFO to serve as acting CFO. Limits the service of an acting CFO to 210 days after the vacancy occurs. Prohibits an individual from serving as acting CFO if he or she did not serve as the District of Columbia Treasurer or as a Deputy CFO for at least 90 days during the one-year period immediately preceding the occurrence of the vacancy.</summary>
