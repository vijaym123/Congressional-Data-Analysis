  <summary>5/22/2013--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out a three-year pilot program to establish 12 VA claims adjudication centers of excellence by selecting the three highest performing regional offices in each of the four areas of the Veterans Benefits Administration. Requires each center to focus on adjudicating claims relating to one medical condition selected by the Secretary. Provides for appropriate employee specialized training with respect to such medical conditions. Prohibits any employee from working concurrently at more than one center, but allows an employee to move from one center to another as long as the employee receives the training appropriate for that center. Authorizes the Secretary to assign additional full-time employees to a center as necessary. Requires the Secretary to select the focus medical conditions within 90 days after the enactment of this Act.</summary>
