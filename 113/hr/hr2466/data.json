Prohibits such an action unless it is begun within two years of the date of the act complained of or the date of the discovery of the damage. Declares that the phrase \"without authorization\" in such Act's prohibitions shall not mean independent derivation or working backwards from a lawfully obtained known product or service to divine the process which aided its development or manufacture."
