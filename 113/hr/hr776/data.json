    "text": "Security in Bonding Act of 2013 - Revises requirements related to assets pledged by a surety. Declares that if another applicable law or regulation permits the acceptance of a bond from a surety that is not subject to specified federal law, and is based on a pledge of assets by the surety, the assets pledged by such surety shall: (1) consist of eligible obligations given as security instead of surety bonds; and (2) be submitted to the government official required to approve or accept the bond, who shall deposit the assets with a depository (the Secretary of the Treasury, a federal reserve bank, or a depository designated by the Secretary). Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 with respect to any Small Business Administration (SBA) guarantee or agreement to indemnify a surety under the Small Business Investment Program against loss from a breach of the terms of a bid bond, payment bond, performance bond, or ancillary bonds, by a principal on any total work order or contract amount at the time of bond execution that does not exceed $ 6.5 million, as adjusted for inflation. Increases from 70% to 90% of the loss incurred and paid by a surety authorized to issue bonds subject to SBA guarantee the SBA's maximum obligation to pay the surety under the guarantee or agreement to indemnify."
