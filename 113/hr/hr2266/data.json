    "text": "Subsidy Reserve Act of 2013 - Amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) to require a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Board) and each bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $500 billion or more (companies) to establish and maintain a Subsidy Reserve. Instructs the Board to: establish a formula for determining the financial benefit received by such companies as a result of the expectations on the part of their shareholders, creditors, and counterparties that the government will shield them from losses in the event of their failure; require them to apply the formula annually to their annual financial statement; and maintain the resulting amount in their Subsidy Reserve, in addition to any such previous amounts. Prohibits a decrease in the amount of funds in the Subsidy Reserve unless a company makes a sale of assets, spins off a subsidiary, or makes a similar divestiture. Permits the decrease only in an amount that reflects the amount of such sale, spin off, or similar divestiture, either on a pro rata basis or according to the risk weighting of the property sold, spun off, or divested. Prohibits amounts in the Subsidy Reserve from being taken into account when determining the companies' capital for purposes of meeting any capital requirement."
