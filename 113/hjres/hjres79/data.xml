  <summary>10/3/2013--Introduced.
Border Security and Enforcement Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 - Makes appropriations for FY2014 for continuing projects or activities not otherwise specifically provided for that were conducted in FY2013 and for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were made available by the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013 (division D of P.L. 113-6) under the headings "Security, Enforcement, and Investigations--U.S. Customs and Border Protection," "Security, Enforcement, and Investigations--U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement," "Security, Enforcement, and Investigations--Coast Guard," "Protection, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery--National Protection and Programs Directorate--Office of Biometric Identity Management," and "Research and Development, Training, and Services--United States Citizenship and Immigration Services." Requires the rate of operations for each such account to be calculated to reflect the full amount of any reduction required in FY2013 pursuant to: (1) the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), and (2) the presidential sequestration order dated March 1, 2013, except as attributable to budget authority made available by the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2). Makes appropriations and funds made available and authority granted under this joint resolution available until whichever of the following first occurs: (1) enactment into law of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this joint resolution, (2) enactment into law of the applicable appropriations Act for FY2014 without any provision for such project or activity, or (3) December 15, 2013. Requires implementation of this joint resolution so that only the most limited funding action be taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities. Authorizes amounts made available for civilian personnel compensation and benefits to be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to avoid furloughs, consistent with the applicable appropriations Act for FY2013, except that such authority shall not be used until after the agency has taken all necessary actions to reduce or defer non-personnel-related administrative expenses. Expresses the sense of Congress that this joint resolution may also be referred to as the Border Safety &amp; Security Act.</summary>
