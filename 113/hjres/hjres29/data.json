Directs federal, state and local government to: (1) regulate, limit, or prohibit contributions and expenditures, including a candidate's own contributions and expenditures, for the purpose of influencing the election of any candidate for public office or any ballot measure; and (2) require that any permissible contributions and expenditures be publicly disclosed. Prohibits the judiciary from construing the spending of money to influence elections to be speech under the First Amendment. Prohibits this amendment from being construed to abridge the freedom of the press."
