    "text": "National Intelligence Program Operations Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 - Makes appropriations, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for national intelligence program operations for FY2014, and for other purposes, such amounts as may be necessary, at a rate for operations provided for in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2013 (division C of P.L. 113-6), for payment of personnel compensation and benefits for civilian employees whom the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) determines necessary to continue the following projects or activities conducted in FY2013, for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were made available under such Act, as set forth under the heading \"National Intelligence Program\" in the classified annex accompanying such Act: producing finished intelligence for the President or senior military or civilian officials of the federal government; collecting human, signals, or technical intelligence; conducting a covert action under the National Security Act of 1947, as directed by the President; providing analytic support to critical ongoing intelligence operations and military combat operations; and maintaining the capability to provide warnings of counterterrorism and international terrorist threats to protect the life, safety, and security of U.S. interests. Makes further appropriations for continuing contracts for compensation of contract employees whom the DNI determines necessary to support such projects and activities. Requires the rate of operations for each such project or activity to be calculated to reflect the full amount of any reduction required in FY2013 pursuant to: (1) the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), and (2) the presidential sequestration order dated March 1, 2013, except as attributable to budget authority made available by the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2). Makes appropriations and funds made available and authority granted under this joint resolution available until whichever of the following first occurs: (1) enactment into law of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this joint resolution, (2) enactment into law of the applicable appropriations Act for FY2014 without any provision for such project or activity, or (3) December 15, 2013. Requires implementation of this joint resolution so that only the most limited funding action be taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities. Expresses the sense of Congress that this joint resolution may also be referred to as the Preserving Our Intelligence Capabilities Act."
