Requires appropriations and funds made available and authority granted pursuant to this joint resolution, unless otherwise provided for in this joint resolution or in the applicable appropriations Act for FY2014, to remain available until whichever of the following first occurs: (1) the enactment of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this joint resolution, (2) the enactment of the applicable appropriations Act for FY2014 without any provision for such project or activity, or (3) December 15, 2013. Requires expenditures made pursuant to this joint resolution to be charged to the applicable appropriation, fund, or authorization whenever a bill in which such applicable appropriation, fund, or authorization is contained is enacted into law. Requires only the most limited funding action of that permitted in this joint resolution to be taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities. Authorizes amounts made available for civilian personnel compensation and benefits in each agency to be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to avoid furloughs in such agencies, consistent with the applicable appropriations Act for FY2013, except that such authority shall not be used until after the agency has taken all necessary actions to reduce or defer non-personnel-related administrative expenses. Expresses the sense of Congress that this joint resolution may also be referred to as the Research for Lifesaving Cures Act."
