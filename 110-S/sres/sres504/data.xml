  <summary>4/9/2008--Passed Senate without amendment.
Condemns the violence in Tibet and calls for restraint by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the people of Tibet. Calls for: (1) a dialogue between the government of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on religious and cultural autonomy for Tibet within China; and (2) release of peaceful protesters. Calls on the PRC to: (1) respect the right of the people of Tibet to speak of the Dalai Lama and possess his photograph; (2) respect basic human rights; (3) allow international journalists free access to China; and (4) provide a full accounting of the March 2008 protests in Tibet. Calls on the Department of State to fully implement the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002. Urges that the agreement permitting the PRC to open further diplomatic missions in the United States should be contingent upon establishment of a U.S. government office in Lhasa, Tibet.</summary>
