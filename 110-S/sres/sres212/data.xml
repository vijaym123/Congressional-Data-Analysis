  <summary>5/21/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that any comprehensive, mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reduction program enacted by Congress should include: (1) determinations of the extent to which other countries that are major contributors of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have established programs that are comparable in the effectiveness to the U.S. program; (2) consequences, in the form of a review of the program or change to other U.S. policies, if such other countries' programs are found to be less effective; (3) determinations relating to whether the U.S. program is increasing the rate of poverty or unemployment in the United States and, if so, a process to review the program; and (4) effective incentives for private entities that sell electricity to increase the percentage of sales generated by clean energy sources.</summary>
