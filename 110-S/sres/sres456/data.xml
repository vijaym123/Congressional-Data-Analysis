  <summary>2/14/2008--Introduced.
Declares that the United States should: (1) undertake bilateral discussions with Canada to negotiate an agreement for the conservation and protection of migratory or transboundary populations of large whales at risk of extinction in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, including mechanisms for reducing incidents of endangered large whales becoming entangled in fishing gear, being struck by ships, or otherwise adversely impacted by human activity; and (2) until that agreement becomes operational, continue to reduce such human activity impacts while taking steps to minimize the economic impact of such efforts on affected industries.</summary>
