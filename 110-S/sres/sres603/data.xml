  <summary>6/26/2008--Introduced.
States that the Senate appreciates the efforts of those countries in Europe that have enacted legislation for the restitution of, or compensation for, private, communal, and religious property confiscated during the Nazi or Communist eras. Urges the governments of Poland and Lithuania and the governments of other European countries that have not already done so to enact legislation so that victims, and communities, of Nazi persecution whose private religious, or communal, property was confiscated by the Nazis and in turn seized by a Communist government are able to obtain restitution of, or compensation for, such property. Welcomes a country in Europe to host a 2009 follow-up international conference to the Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets which would address issues relating to: (1) restitution or compensation; and (2) the opening of archives and the work of historical commissions.</summary>
