  <summary>12/19/2007--Introduced.
Condemns statements by officials of the government of the Russian Federation that the Russian Federation should recognize the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent of the Republic of Georgia. Affirms that the restoration of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia is in the interest of all who seek peace and stability in the region. Urges all parties to the conflicts in the Republic of Georgia and governments around the world to eschew rhetoric that escalates tensions and undermines efforts to negotiate a settlement to the conflicts.</summary>
