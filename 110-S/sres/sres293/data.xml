Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) members of Project Compassion (a project to provide to family members portraits of members of the Armed Forces who have died while serving on active duty since September 11, 2001) have demonstrated extraordinary patriotism and support to members of the Armed Forces who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan; (2) the United States owes its gratitude to the Project's members; and (3) the Senate commends the Project's professional portrait artists and the entire organization for their tireless work in paying tribute to fallen members of the Armed Forces.</summary>
