  <summary>9/23/2008--Passed Senate without amendment.
Recognizes the historical and educational significance of the USS Constellation, a 153-year-old warship berthed in Baltimore, Maryland, as a reminder of both the U.S. participation in the slave trade and U.S. government efforts to suppress the inhumane practice. Applauds the historic vessel's preservation and the efforts of the USS Constellation Museum to engage people from all over the world with this vital part of history. Supports the Constellation as an appropriate site to commemorate, in 2008, the bicentennial of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade.</summary>
