  <summary>5/1/2007--Passed Senate without amendment.
Commends the countries that have: (1) ratified the amendments to the Agreement Constituting an International Commission for the International Tracing Service ("Bonn Accords'') to allow for open access to the Holocaust archives of the International Tracing Service (ITS) located at Bad Arolsen, Germany; and (2) committed to expedite the archives' release. Urges: (1) countries that have not ratified the amendments to abide by the May 2006 treaty obligations and expedite such ratification; and (2) member countries of the International Commission of the ITS to consider the short time left to Holocaust survivors and unanimously consent to open the ITS archives should all countries not ratify the amendments by May 2007. States that the Senate refuses to forget the Holocaust murder of 6 million Jews and more than 5 million other victims by Nazi perpetrators and their collaborators.</summary>
