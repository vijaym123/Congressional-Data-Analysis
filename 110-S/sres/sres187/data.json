Condemns: (1) recent acts of violence and looting in Estonia; (2) attacks and threats against Estonia's embassies and officials in Russia and other countries; and (3) political efforts to exploit the memory of the victims of the Second World War. Urges all activists to express their views peacefully. Honors the sacrifice of all those, including Red Army soldiers, who gave their lives to defeat Nazism. Supports the government of Estonia's efforts to initiate a peaceful dialogue with the government of the Russian Federation. Urges the governments of all countries to: (1) condemn the violence that has occurred in Estonia, Moscow, and elsewhere in 2007, and to urge all parties to express their views peacefully; (2) assist the government of Estonia in its cyber-attacks investigation; and (3) fulfill their obligations under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."
