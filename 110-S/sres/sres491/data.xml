Recognizes the urgency for Congress to approve additional federal funds required by the Corps of Engineers by October 1, 2008, to complete hurricane, coastal, and flood protection and hurricane and flood damage reduction activities and related features to meet the President's commitment to complete the Corps work necessary for the updated 100-year protection standard for the greater New Orleans area by the 2011 hurricane season. Expresses the Senate's finding that the additional funds to reduce the risk to that area from storm surges and to provide at least an updated 100-year protection standard and address associated flood protection needs shall be carried out at full federal expense.</summary>
