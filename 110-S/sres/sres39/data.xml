  <summary>1/24/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) under the Constitution it is Congress that has the power to take the country from a state of peace to a state of war; (2) the framers of the Constitution understood that the President may act to defend the country and repel sudden attack but reserved the matter of offensive war to the Congress as the representatives of the people; (3) the Senate affirms the requirement under the Constitution that the President seek congressional approval before the United States undertakes offensive military action against another nation; (4) consultation by the President with the Congress on any U.S. undertaking of offensive military action against another nation must allow for full congressional debate; and (5) any offensive military action by the United States against another country shall occur only after Congress has authorized such action.</summary>
