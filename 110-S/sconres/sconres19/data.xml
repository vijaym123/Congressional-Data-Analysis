  <summary>3/14/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the government of Iran's nuclear program continues should be considered a serious threat to the United States and its military forces and personnel in the Middle East, and to U.S. allies and interests in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; (2) as a result of Iran's noncompliance with U.N. Security Resolution 1737 (2006) the Security Council should implement additional sanctions to persuade Iran to comply with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requirements; (3) full international economic sanctions offer the best opportunity to prevent the development of a nuclear weapon in Iran; and (4) the elimination of the threat of a nuclear Iran is in the long term interest of the people of Iran, the region, and the world.</summary>
