Security Resolution 1737 (2006) the Security Council should implement additional sanctions to persuade Iran to comply with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requirements; (3) full international economic sanctions offer the best opportunity to prevent the development of a nuclear weapon in Iran; and (4) the elimination of the threat of a nuclear Iran is in the long term interest of the people of Iran, the region, and the world."
