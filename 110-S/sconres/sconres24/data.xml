  <summary>3/23/2007--Introduced.
Permits the Live Earth organization and the Alliance for Climate Protection to sponsor the Live Earth Concert as a free public event on the Capitol grounds on July 7, 2007. Requires the sponsors to enter into an agreement with the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board under which the sponsors agree to: (1) reimburse the U.S. Capitol Police for all costs incurred (including additional personnel costs and overtime) in meeting the security related needs at the event; and (2) comply with the requirements of this Act. Revokes the authority to hold the event on the Capitol grounds if the sponsors fail, or are unable, to enter into such agreement within 14 days before the scheduled date of the event.</summary>
