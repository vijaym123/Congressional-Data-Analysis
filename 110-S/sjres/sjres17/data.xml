  <summary>6/3/2008--Public Law.
Declares that: (1) the United States should initiate discussions to negotiate international agreements for managing migratory, transboundary, and straddling fish stocks in the Arctic Ocean and establishing new international fisheries management organizations for the region; (2) such agreements should conform with the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement and contain mechanisms for establishing elements necessary for sustaining future Arctic fish stocks; (3) as international fisheries agreements are negotiated and implemented, the United States should consult with the North Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council and Alaska Native subsistence communities of the Arctic; and (4) until the agreements come into force, the United States should support international efforts to halt the expansion of commercial fishing activities in the high seas of the Arctic Ocean.</summary>
