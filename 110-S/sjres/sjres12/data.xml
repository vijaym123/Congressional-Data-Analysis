  <summary>4/25/2007--Introduced.
Jerusalem Resolution - Requires the United States, not later than 180 days before recognizing a Palestinian state, to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Prohibits U.S. recognition of a Palestinian state until the international community resolves the status of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's undivided capital. Expresses the sense of Congress that the citizens of Israel should be allowed, as a fundamental human right recognized by the United States and U.N. General Assembly Resolution 181 of November 29, 1947, to worship freely and according to their traditions.</summary>
