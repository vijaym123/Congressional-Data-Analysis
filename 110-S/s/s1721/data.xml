Directs the Secretary to: (1) study the economic benefits to milk producers of establishing a two-class system (fluid milk class and manufacturing grade milk class) for classifying milk under federal milk marketing orders; and (2) amend federal milk marketing orders to implement such system if it would benefit milk producers. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, to eliminate pilot program status for, and extend, the dairy forward pricing program. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize rural industrial assistance loans and loan guarantees for dairy processors to invest in new equipment and technologies. Amends the Farm Credit Act of 1971 to authorize banks for cooperatives to assist dairy processing cooperatives with export activities.
