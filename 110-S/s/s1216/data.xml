  <summary>4/25/2007--Introduced.
Laser Visa Extension Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to permit a national of Mexico to travel up to 100 miles from the international border between Mexico and New Mexico if such national: (1) possesses a valid machine-readable biometric border crossing identification card issued by a Department of State consular officer; (2) enters New Mexico through a port of entry where such card is processed using a machine reader; (3) has successfully completed any required background check; and (4) is admitted into the United States as a nonimmigrant tourist or business visitor. Authorizes the Secretary to limit the travel of an otherwise qualifying national of Mexico to less than 100 miles from the Mexico-New Mexico border if such national was previously admitted into the United States as a nonimmigrant and violated the terms and conditions of such status.</summary>
