Defines covered service member as a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or a Reserve, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, or is otherwise in medical hold or medical holdover status, for a serious injury or illness. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the availability of such leave during any other 12-month period. Provides for the substitution of accrued paid vacation, personal, or family leave for any part of the 26-week period. Limits a husband and wife both working for the same employer to such 26 weeks altogether during a single 12-month period."
