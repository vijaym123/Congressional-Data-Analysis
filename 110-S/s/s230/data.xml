  <summary>1/9/2007--Introduced.
Lobbying and Ethics Reform Act of 2007 - Revises the Standing Rules of the Senate or prescribes requirements with respect to: (1) conference reports; (2) elimination of certain floor privileges and other benefits and privileges for former Members, Senate officers, and Speakers of the House who are lobbyists or seek financial gain; (3) a ban on gifts from lobbyists; (4) travel restrictions and disclosure; (5) post-employment restrictions; (6) public disclosure by Members of employment negotiations; (7) conflicts of interest with respect to a Member's spouse or immediate family members; (8) a Member's use of influence on certain hiring decisions; and (9) notices of intent to object to proceeding to a measure or matter. Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA) and the Foreign Agents Registration Act with respect to various specified disclosures by registered lobbyists and foreign government lobbyists. Requires: (1) the Comptroller General to audit lobbying registration and related reports annually; and (2) the Select Committee on Ethics to provide certain ethics training and awareness programs for Senators and their staff. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the lobbying community should develop specified proposals for multiple self-regulatory organizations. Amends the federal criminal code to extend from one to two years the ban on lobbying contacts by former very senior executive personnel, former Members of Congress, and officers of the legislative branch with any Member, officer, or employee of the entity in which such person served before his or her tenure terminated. Prohibits former employees of either chamber of Congress, within two years after leaving office, from making lobbying contacts with a Member, officer, or employee of either chamber. Amends the LDA to prohibit a registered lobbyist from knowingly making a gift or providing travel to a Member, officer, or employee of Congress, unless the gift or travel may be accepted under the rules of the House or the Senate. Establishes the Senate Office of Public Integrity.</summary>
