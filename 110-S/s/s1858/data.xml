Sets forth deadlines for the Secretary to make a decision on Advisory Committee recommendations.Requires the Advisory Committee to continue to operate during the five-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act.(Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to establish and maintain a central clearinghouse of current information on newborn screening. Sets forth requirements for such clearinghouse, including: (1) ensuring that the clearinghouse is available on the Internet and is updated at least quarterly; (2) providing links to websites that have expertise in newborn screening; (3) providing information about newborn conditions and screening services available in each state; (4) providing current research on conditions for which newborn screening tests are available; and (5) providing the availability of federal funding for newborn and child screening for heritable disorders.(Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to provide for: (1) quality assurance for screening laboratories; and (2) appropriate quality control and other performance test materials to evaluate the performance of new screening tools.Requires the Secretary to establish an Interagency Coordinating Committee on Newborn and Child Screening to make recommendations on: (1) programs to collect, analyze, and make available data on certain heritable disorders; and (2) the establishment of regional centers to conduct applied epidemiological research on effective interventions for preventing poor health outcomes resulting from such disorders and to provide information and education to the public on such effective interventions.(Sec. 7) Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of CDC, to develop a national contingency plan for newborn screening in the event of a public health emergency. Authorizes the Secretary to continue to carry out, coordinate, and expand research in newborn screening (to be known as the Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Research Program), including: (1) identifying, developing, and testing the most promising new screening technologies; and (2) experimental treatments and disease management strategies for conditions that can be detected through newborn screening for which treatment is not yet available.</summary>
