Requires the Alaska Railroad to pay the costs of any such land exchange, including the costs of compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the costs of land surveys, and other reasonable costs necessary to carry out the exchange. Requires the Secretary and the Railroad to carry out the land exchange under this Act not later than five years after enactment of this Act."
