Denali National Park and Alaska Railroad Land Exchange Act of 2007 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey to the Alaska Railroad certain federal land within the boundary of Denali National Park in Alaska in exchange for certain non-federal land composed of an exclusive-use easement owned by the Railroad within the Park, including the former Denali Park Station Wye track, for use for turning railroad trains around near Denali Park Station. Requires the Alaska Railroad to pay the costs of any such land exchange, including the costs of compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the costs of land surveys, and other reasonable costs necessary to carry out the exchange. Requires the Secretary and the Railroad to carry out the land exchange under this Act not later than five years after enactment of this Act.</summary>
