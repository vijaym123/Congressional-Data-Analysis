    "text": "Alaska Timber Industry Fairness Act - Establishes a two-year grant program for retooling projects that are designed to facilitate the economic adjustment of specified timber entities by allowing them to: (1) improve or alter their business and practices to become more competitive within the timber industry; or (2) shift to a type of business that is not related to the timber industry. Authorizes the Assistant Secretary for Economic Development of the Department of Commerce to provide grants under such program to any entity that operated in the timber industry in Alaska on January 1, 2008, that operated in Alaska for not less than 10 years, and that can demonstrate that it has been harmed by federal laws or regulations relating to the timber industry, including the United States Forest Service's policies and land management plans completed pursuant to National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.Sets forth provisions concerning eligible uses of grant funding.Treats a grant recipient as a small business concern owned or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (as that term is defined in the Small Business Act) for three years after the grant was approved."
