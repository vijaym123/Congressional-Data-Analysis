Makes any sale, transfer, donation, or disposal of a unit under the plan subject to Stafford Act disposal requirements and other applicable law, except with respect to such sale or other actions to states, other governmental entities, and voluntary organizations for the purpose of providing temporary housing to victims of incidents caused by hazards that do not result in a declaration of a major disaster or emergency by the President if the governor of the affected state certifies that there is an urgent need for the units and the state is unable to provide such units in a timely manner. Directs the Administrator to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of the distribution, sale, transfer, donation, or other disposal of units.
