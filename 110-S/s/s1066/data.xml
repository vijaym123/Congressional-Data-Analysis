  <summary>3/29/2007--Introduced.
Medical Education Affordability Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to revise specified regulations regarding student loan repayment deferment under certain programs of the Higher Education Act of 1965 with respect to borrowers who qualify for such deferment on the basis of economic hardship and are in postgraduate medical or dental internship, residency, or fellowship programs. Revises such regulations to: (1) make such deferment available to such borrowers for the duration of postgraduate medical or dental internship, residency, or fellowship programs if they must be successfully completed to begin work in the profession, or they lead to a degree or certificate from a health professional school or facility that offers postgraduate training; and (2) make it unnecessary for borrowers to apply annually for such deferments while participating in such programs.</summary>
