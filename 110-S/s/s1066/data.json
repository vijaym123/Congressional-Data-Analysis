Revises such regulations to: (1) make such deferment available to such borrowers for the duration of postgraduate medical or dental internship, residency, or fellowship programs if they must be successfully completed to begin work in the profession, or they lead to a degree or certificate from a health professional school or facility that offers postgraduate training; and (2) make it unnecessary for borrowers to apply annually for such deferments while participating in such programs."
