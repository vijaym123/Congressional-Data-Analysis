Requires the head of an IC element or instrumentality who detains or has control of such an individual to notify the International Committee of the Red Cross and provide access to such individual in a manner consistent with practices of the Armed Forces. Prohibits the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from permitting a CIA contractor or subcontractor to carry out an interrogation (instead requiring a CIA employee to do so)."
