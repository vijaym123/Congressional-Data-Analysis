Children's Express Lane to Health Coverage Act of 2007 - Amends titles XIX (Medicaid) and XXI (State Children's Health Insurance) (SCHIP) of the Social Security Act to give states the option of providing for simplified determinations of a child's or pregnant woman's financial eligibility for Medicaid or SCHIP that are made by a non-health federal or state agency administering a program providing nutrition or other public assistance.Allows state mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems, for which Medicaid payments may be made, to include technology that enables inter-program connections and other technology that: (1) reduces the number of individuals inaccurately granted eligibility; (2) increases the number of individuals accurately granted eligibility; or (3) improves the efficiency of eligibility determinations.Authorizes relevant federal, state, local, and private entities to convey information about an individual to a person directly connected with the administration of a state Medicaid plan or SCHIP, if such information is used solely for the purposes of identifying, verifying, and enrolling individuals who are eligible.</summary>
