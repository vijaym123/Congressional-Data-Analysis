    "text": "Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act - Requires a member of the Armed Forces (member) who is medically retired because of physical disability incurred in or aggravated by military service to be treated as an active-duty member, for purposes of entitlement to military health care services and benefits, for the longer of: (1) the two-year period after medical retirement; or (2) the period during which the member is on the temporary disability retirement list. Requires active-duty members receiving health care and services through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for an injury or illness which would qualify for medical retirement to be treated as a veteran for the longer of: (1) the two-year period after the member incurs the injury or illness; or (2) the period during which the member is assigned to the VA for health care services and benefits. Directs the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs to establish a joint office for the Department of Defense (DOD) and VA for the coordination of assistance to members in their transition from military service to civilian life. Requires each member determined to be unfit to perform required duties to: (1) be evaluated by a disability ratings team at the appropriate military medical treatment facility; and (2) either placed on the temporary disability retired list or further evaluated for assignment of a final disability rating. Allows member appeal of a determination of unfitness. Requires final disability ratings to be used for determining eligibility for retired pay and other benefits. Requires an interim and final report from the Comptroller General to Congress on DOD and VA programs for the assessment and treatment of wounded members."
