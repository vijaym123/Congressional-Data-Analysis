Lovell Federal Health Care Center Act of 2008 - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (Secretary), upon the conclusion of a resource-sharing agreement between the Secretary and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to transfer to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the Navy ambulatory care center, parking structure, supporting facilities, and related medical personal property and equipment in Great Lakes, Illinois. Designates such facility and supporting facilities as the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (Center). Provides a reversionary interest to the Secretary if the property is not used in accordance with the resource-sharing agreement or in the event of lack of facilities integration. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer to the VA functions necessary for Center operation. Extends through FY2020 a joint Department of Defense (DOD)-VA program to identify, implement, and evaluate creative health care coordination and sharing initiatives at the facility, intraregional, and nationwide levels. Deems the Center a military facility for purposes of the eligibility of members of the Armed Forces to receive care and services there."
