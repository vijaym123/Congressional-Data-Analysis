Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to eliminate the consumptive demand exception to the prohibition against importation of goods manufactured by convict, forced, or indentured labor. (Thus, bans the importation of goods manufactured by convict, forced, or indentured labor even if similar goods are not sufficiently produced in the United States to meet U.S. consumer demand.)</summary>
