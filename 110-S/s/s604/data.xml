  <summary>2/15/2007--Introduced.
Military Health Care Protection Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Department of Defense (DOD) and the nation have a committed obligation to provide health benefits to retired military personnel that exceeds the obligation of corporate employers to their employees; (2) DOD has many additional options to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that do not disadvantage retirees, and should pursue such options rather than seeking large fee increases for retirees and their dependents; and (3) any percentage increase in health care fees, deductibles, or copayments for retirees and their families, and for members of the Selected Reserve currently serving on active duty and their families, should not exceed the percentage increase in military retired pay or basic pay, respectively. Limits to the previous percentage increase in retired or basic pay the authorized annual fee increase under: (1) the DOD pharmacy benefits program; and (2) certain premiums and other charges under the TRICARE program (a DOD managed health care program). Prohibits: (1) charges for DOD inpatient care from exceeding $535 per day after March 31, 2006 (currently, during the period beginning on April 1, 2006, and ending on September 30, 2007); (2) charging an enrollment fee under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS); and (3) a person from being denied a claim due to failure to enroll.</summary>
