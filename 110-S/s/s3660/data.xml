  <summary>10/1/2008--Introduced.
Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to publish the American National Standard for Single and Multiple Station Carbon Monoxide Alarms (American National Standard ANSI/UL 2034-2005) as a mandatory consumer product safety standard. Makes it unlawful for any manufacturer or distributor to import into or distribute any new assembled or unassembled residential carbon monoxide detector unless it complies with the standard. Requires the CPSC to promulgate consumer product safety rules requiring, at a minimum, that every portable generator sold to the public for purposes other than resale shall be equipped with an interlock safety device that: (1) detects the level of carbon monoxide in the areas surrounding such portable generator; and (2) automatically turns off the portable generator before the level of carbon monoxide reaches a level that would cause serious bodily injury or death to people. Requires the CPSC to establish a grant program to provide assistance to states to carry out a carbon monoxide alarm program.</summary>
