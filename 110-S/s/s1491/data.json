Defines \"E-85 fuel\" as a blend of gasoline at least 85% derived from ethanol (or any other percentage, not below 70%, as determined by the Secretary for requirements relating to cold start, safety, or vehicle functions). Requires a grant equal to 20% of the total installation costs. Amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary to establish a program, funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation, to make competitive grants to eligible nonprofit organizations or institutions of higher education to educate governmental and private entities that operate vehicle fleets, other interested entities, and the public about the benefits of E-85 fuel use."
