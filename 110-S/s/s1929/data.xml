Sierra Vista Subwatershed Feasibility Study Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to complete a feasibility study of alternatives to augment water supplies in the Sierra Vista Subwatershed, Arizona, that are identified as appropriate for further study in a Bureau of Reclamation appraisal report dated June 2007.Directs the Secretary, in evaluating the feasibility of alternatives, to: (1) include any required environmental reviews, the construction, operations, maintenance, and replacement costs for each alternative, and the economic feasibility of each alternative; (2) take into consideration the ability of government and private sources to fund such costs; (3) establish the basis for any cost-sharing allocations and any anticipated repayment of federal contributions; and (4) perform a cost-benefit analysis.Limits the federal share of total costs of the study to 45%. Permits the nonfederal share to be in the form of in-kind services that the Secretary determines would contribute substantially toward the conduct and completion of the study. Expresses the intent of Congress that the Secretary complete the study within 30 months of enactment. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
