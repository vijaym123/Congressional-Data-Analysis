Prohibits the use of appropriations to the Fund for a fiscal year unless the amount equal to the net increase in the negative credit subsidy for specified mortgage insurance programs is first made available for: (1) single family housing mortgage insurance; (2) housing counseling; and (3) mortgage insurance technology, procedures, processes, program performance, and salaries. Limits Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance premium increases. Specifies affordable housing eligibility criteria for a rental dwelling unit and one- to four-family owner-occupied housing, including a priority to families on section 8 rental assistance or public housing waiting lists. Requires the Secretary to establish a green housing clearinghouse for Fund grantees and recipients. Declares that nothing in this Act allows any payments under it for any individual or head of household that is not a legal U.S. resident."
