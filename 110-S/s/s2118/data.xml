  <summary>9/28/2007--Introduced.
Proven Programs for the Future of Education Act of 2007 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide that in all competitive grants awarded by the Department of Education to states or local educational agencies (LEAs) or by states to LEAs under the Act, 10% of the competitive preference points may be awarded to states and LEAs that propose to use research-proven programs, if appropriate. Requires reading instruction under the Reading First program to be research-proven or, at a minimum, meet the current requirement that it be scientifically-based. Defines "research-proven reading programs" as those that are deemed to be such programs by a Department of Education review panel and are evaluated in at least two studies, both of which meet specified minimum criteria that require the use of control groups.</summary>
