  <summary>8/1/2008--Introduced.
Liquefied Natural Gas Import Terminal Authorization Act - Amends the Natural Gas Act to prohibit siting, constructing, expanding, or operating a liquefied natural gas import terminal within a state unless: (1) an application to do so is submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and to the agency with siting authority in the state in which the liquefied natural gas import terminal is located; and (2) FERC and the state agency issue an order approving the application. Sets forth terms and conditions for application approval. Amends federal transportation law to permit a state to adopt additional or more stringent safety standards for liquefied natural gas pipeline facilities if those standards are compatible with the minimum standards prescribed under federal pipeline safety law. Prohibits a state authority from adopting or continuing in force safety standards for interstate pipeline facilities or transportation, except in the case of liquefied natural gas pipeline facilities.</summary>
