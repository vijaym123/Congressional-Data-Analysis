  <summary>2/16/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that all members of the Armed Forces should be permitted to select who shall receive the death gratuity (awarded for members who die while on active duty or inactive duty training), and that the Secretaries of Defense and the military departments should take appropriate action to afford members such opportunity, along with appropriate counseling. Revises the current statutory priority list of designated death gratuity beneficiaries to place first in such list any individual designated by the person (member) in writing.</summary>
