Provides limits to the temporary rating period (depending on the category), but authorizes the Secretary to extend such period when appropriate.

(Sec. 222) Establishes in the VA an Office of Survivors Assistance to advise the Secretary on VA policies, programs, legislative issues, and other initiatives affecting the survivors and dependents of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces.

(Sec. 403) Extends full-time and family SGLI coverage to certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve.
