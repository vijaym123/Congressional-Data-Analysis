Helping Our States Through Tourism Act of 2007 or HOST Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a grant program to assist relevant tourism entities (conventions, visitors bureaus, and other tourism organizations) to promote travel and tourism in Louisiana and Mississippi to negate the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on travel and tourism there. Authorizes the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make economic injury disaster loans to small businesses located within disaster areas declared as a result of such hurricanes that suffered economic injury from the slowdown in travel and tourism in such areas after such hurricanes. Establishes in the Treasury the Federal Gulf Coast Travel and Meetings Fund to pay for lodging, meals, travel, and other expenses associated with conventions, conferences, meetings, etc. attended by no fewer than 100 federal employees and occurring within such disaster areas.</summary>
