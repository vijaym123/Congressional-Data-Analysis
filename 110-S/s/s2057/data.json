Expresses the sense of Congress that discrimination on such basis against federal employees and applicants is currently prohibited. Prohibits any federal employee who has authority to take, direct, recommend, or approve any personnel action from discriminating for or against any federal employee or applicant on such basis.Revises procedures of the MSPB and OSC, including by requiring the MSPB to use the National Labor Relations Board model for procedural due process and by requiring the OSC to prescribe regulations necessary to receive and investigate allegations of prohibited personnel practices.Requires the Special Counsel to have professional experience that demonstrates an understanding of and a commitment to protecting the merit based civil service.Requires the OSC to publish specified whistleblower disclosures and reports.Sets forth MSPB and OSC reporting requirements with respect to incidences of prohibited personnel practices."
