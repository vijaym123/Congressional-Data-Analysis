Deauthorizes: (1) a portion of the project for navigation at Rockland Harbor, Maine; and (2) the portion of the Illinois Waterway project authorized by the River and Harbor Act of 1927 in the South Fork of the South Branch of the Chicago River. Redesignates a portion of the navigation project, Saco River, Maine, described as a maneuvering basin as an anchorage area. Directs the Secretary of the Army, by May 31, 2007, to publish a supplement to the major rehabilitation report for the Herbert Hoover Dike system, approved by the Chief of Engineers in November 2000, which shall: (1) evaluate existing conditions at the Herbert Hoover Dike system; (2) identify additional risks associated with flood events at the system that are equal to or greater than the standard projected flood risks; (3) evaluate the potential to integrate Corps of Engineers projects into an enhanced flood protection system for Lake Okeechobee, including the potential for additional water storage north of that lake and an analysis of other project features included in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan; and (4) review the report prepared for the South Florida Water Management District dated April 2006.</summary>
