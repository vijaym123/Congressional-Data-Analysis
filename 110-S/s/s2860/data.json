Requires a creditor to provide a copy of each such appraisal to the consumer without charge, at least three days prior to the transaction closing date. Declares unfair or deceptive specified property appraisal practices in the provision of: (1) mortgage lending services for a consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling; or (2) any mortgage brokerage services for such a transaction. Establishes civil monetary penalties for such practices. Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Trade Commission to jointly prescribe regulations defining such unfair or deceptive acts or practices."
