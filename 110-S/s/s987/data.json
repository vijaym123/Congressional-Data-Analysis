    "text": "Biofuels for Energy Security and Transportation Act of 2007 - Directs the President to: (1) promulgate regulations to ensure that motor vehicle fuel, home heating oil, and boiler fuel sold or introduced into commerce contains prescribed volumes of renewable fuel for calendar years 2008-2022; and (2) publish in the Federal Register the renewable fuel obligation that ensures that such requirements are met. Exempts small refineries until calendar year 2013 from renewable fuel program requirements. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to establish a pilot program administered through the Department of Energy's Vehicle Technology Deployment Program to provide up to 10 geographically-dispersed project grants to governmental entities and metropolitan transportation authorities to establish refueling infrastructure corridors for gasoline blends or diesel fuel containing renewable fuel. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to increase funding for bioenergy research and development. Authorizes the Secretary to make loan guarantees for renewable fuel facilities. Directs the Secretary to provide grants: (1) for research, development and implementation of renewable fuel production technologies in states with low rates of ethanol production, including low rates of cellulosic biomass ethanol; and (2) to promote infrastructure to support transportation of biomass to local biorefineries, including by portable processing equipment. Directs the Secretary to establish a biorefinery information center. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to impose a fuel tank cap labeling requirement for alternative fueled vehicles beginning with model year 2010 to inform consumers that such vehicle can operate on alternative fuel. Requires various specified studies relating to biofuels technologies."
