Requires the designee to: (1) ensure that such ballots are delivered prior to the time established for the closing of the polls on the date of the election; and (2) carry out delivery requirements through a contract with one or more providers of express mail services, which shall include a mechanism for ballot tracking. Provides a special rule for voters in jurisdictions using post office boxes for the collection of such ballots. Prohibits states from refusing to accept such ballots on the grounds that they were not delivered by the U.S. Postal Service. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the designee to: (1) provide outreach to absentee military voters on the procedures established under this Act; (2) report, after each general election, to the congressional defense and appropriations committees on the utilization of such procedures; and (3) submit a one-time report to such committees on the status of implementation of this Act. Prohibits states from refusing to accept voter registration and absentee ballot applications and write-in ballots for failure to meet nonessential requirements (requirements not clearly necessary to prevent fraud in the conduct of elections)."
