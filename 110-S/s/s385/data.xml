  <summary>1/24/2007--Introduced.
Interoperable Emergency Communications Act - Amends the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 to revise provisions concerning the grant program to assist public agencies in establishing the interoperability of public safety emergency communications to specify five (currently, one) specific grant activities. Requires the awarding of at least $1 billion by September 30, 2007, pursuant to provisions of the Call Home Act of 2006. Amends the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to prohibit construing such Act or any amendments made by it as limiting the authority of the Department of Commerce or the Federal Communications Commission.</summary>
