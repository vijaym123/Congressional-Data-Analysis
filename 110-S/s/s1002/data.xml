Older Americans Reauthorization Technical Corrections Act - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 with respect to incentives for effective performance by states and tribal organizations in the efficient delivery of nutritious meals to older individuals. Repeals certain provisions regarding state agency and tribal grantee commodity purchases, as added by the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006. Restores former commodity purchase provisions, with revisions. Entitles each state agency and tribal grantee to use its allotments to obtain from the Secretary of Agriculture commodities available through any food program of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) at the rates at which such commodities are valued for such program. (Currently, such purchases are not limited to commodities from USDA food programs, but may be any U.S. agricultural commodity and other foods.) Repeals the authority of a state agency or tribal grantee to opt to use part or all of the amounts it receives to pay a school food authority to obtain U.S. agricultural commodities for its nutrition projects. Prescribes requirements for Secretary of Agriculture determination of state agency and tribal grantee allotments. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture to agree on reimbursement amounts and procedures.</summary>
