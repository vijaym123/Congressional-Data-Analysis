Applies the same treatment to related child's insurance and widow's and widower's insurance benefits. Makes medical findings by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of total service-connected disability by reason of unemployability conclusive evidence of disability for OASDI and SSI purposes. Requires treatment of any determination of a veteran's disability by the Commissioner of Social Security for OASDI and SSI purposes as a disability or a combination of disabilities rated as 100% disabling by reason of individual unemployability for veterans' benefits purposes. Cautions, however, that such requirement shall not be construed to establish a service-connection or presumption of service-connection with respect to any disability of a veteran."
