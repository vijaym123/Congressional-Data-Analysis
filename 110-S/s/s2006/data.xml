Rate Payer Recovery Act of 2007 - Amends the Robert T.

Cites conditions for large in-lieu contributions to a private or investor-owned power facility in any case in which the owner determines that the public welfare would not best be served by repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing the facility.</summary>
