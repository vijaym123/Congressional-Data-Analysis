Amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Foreign Trade Zones Act to permit the transfer of distilled spirits used in a foreign trade zone for the manufacture or production of nonbeverage products (i.e., medicines, medicinal preparations, food products, flavors, flavoring extracts, or perfume, which are unfit for beverage purposes) to an activated foreign trade zone without payment of applicable excise taxes. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) require manufacturers and producers of such nonbeverage products to file an adequate bond and permit; and (2) examine records and compel testimony to enforce the provisions of this Act.</summary>
