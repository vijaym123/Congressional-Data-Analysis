Prohibits the insurer from: (1) declining such coverage based on past or future lawful foreign travel by the insured; or (2) charging a premium for the coverage that is excessive and not based on a good faith actuarial analysis. Allows declination of or limited coverage for travel to foreign destinations for which serious health-related warnings have been issued, or in which an ongoing military conflict or serious unlawful situation is taking place."
