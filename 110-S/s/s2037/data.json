Requires the manufacturer of a consumer product, regardless of whether it is subject to a consumer product safety standard, to place distinguishing marks on the product (as much as feasible), and on its packaging, that will enable the ultimate purchaser to determine the source, date, and cohort of production of the product by reference to those marks."
