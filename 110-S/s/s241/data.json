Sets forth the terms and conditions that such an agreement shall contain, including that the agreement provide for: (1) clear and direct benefits to natural resources in units of the NPS; (2) the preservation, conservation, and restoration of coastal and riparian systems, watersheds, and wetlands; (3) preventing, controlling, or eradicating invasive exotic species that occupy land within a unit of the NPS or adjacent to such a unit; or (4) restoration of natural resources, including native wildlife habitat. Prohibits the Secretary from using any amounts associated with an agreement entered into under the Act for the purposes of land acquisition, regulatory activity, or the development, maintenance, or operation of infrastructure, with the exception of ancillary support facilities that the Secretary determines to be necessary for the completion of projects or activities identified in the agreement.
