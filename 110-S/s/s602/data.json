Requires that the FCC consider advanced blocking technologies that: (1) may be appropriate across a wide variety of distribution platforms (including wired, wireless, and Internet platforms) and transmitting or receiving devices; (2) can filter language based on information in closed captioning; (3) operate independently of the program creator's ratings; and (4) may enhance the parent's ability to protect his or her child from indecent or objectionable programming, as determined by that parent. Requires a report to Congress. Defines \"advanced blocking technologies\" as technologies that can improve or enhance the ability of a parent to protect his or her child from any indecent or objectionable video or audio programming, as determined by the parent, transmitted through wire, wireless, or radio communication."
