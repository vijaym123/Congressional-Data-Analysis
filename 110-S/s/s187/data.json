Authorizes the hiring of additional personnel in the Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), and the Court to process surveillance applications. Requires the Directors of the FBI and NSA to develop regulations for conducting and seeking approval for emergency electronic surveillance, preparing and submitting applications for such surveillance, and training personnel. Extends from 72 to 168 hours the period during which the Attorney General may authorize emergency electronic surveillance pending judicial authorization of such surveillance. Permits electronic surveillance without a court order of communications between individuals outside the United States for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence information even if such communications pass through, or the surveillance device is located within, the United States. Requires a court order for the contents of any wire or radio communication sent by a person inside the United States to a person outside the United States. Authorizes enhanced congressional oversight of electronic surveillance activities under FISA. Requires Supreme Court review of any final decision of a U.S. court of appeals concerning the legality of the Terrorist Surveillance Program."
