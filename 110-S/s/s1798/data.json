Requires the Secretary to award grants to states, local or tribal governments, trauma centers, regional trauma center coordinating entities, or public health entities for all hazards preparedness in the border area, including bioterrorism and infectious disease. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission Act. Allows the Secretary to coordinate with the Secretary of Homeland Security in establishing a health alert system that: (1) alerts clinicians and public health officials of emerging disease clusters and syndromes along the border area; and (2) is alerted to signs of health threats, disasters of mass scale, or bioterrorism along the border area. Requires the Secretary to enter into a contract with the Institute of Medicine for the study of binational health infrastructure (including trauma and emergency care) and health insurance efforts. Amends the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission Act to authorize any member or staff of the Commission to provide advice or recommendations to Congress concerning issues that are considered by the Commission."
