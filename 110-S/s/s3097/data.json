(Current law establishes the Foundation as an independent establishment in the executive branch.) Transfers all functions and assets of the Foundation to the Bureau. Replaces the existing Board of Directors with a Vietnam Education Foundation Advisory Committee. Revises fellowship provisions to provide: (1) fellowships for post-secondary studies at U.S. institutions of higher education (current law provides fellowships for graduate and postgraduate levels); and (2) fellowship priority for students studying the basic sciences. Authorizes the Secretary of State, through the Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, to award grants to institutions of higher education for a partnership with the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to establish an American Research College in Vietnam for undergraduate studies."
