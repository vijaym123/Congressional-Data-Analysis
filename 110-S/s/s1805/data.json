Repeals the requirement that certain mortgagors, before a mortgage is insured, complete a program of counseling on the responsibilities and financial management involved in homeownership. Increases high-cost area and project-based additional mortgage loan limits for FHA-insured mortgages for: (1) rental housing; (2) cooperative housing; (3) rehabilitation and neighborhood conservation housing insurance; (4) moderate income and displaced family housing; (5) housing for the elderly; and (6) condominiums."
