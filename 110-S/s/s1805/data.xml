  <summary>7/17/2007--Introduced.
FHA Loan Limit Adjustment Act of 2007 - Amends the National Housing Act with respect to mortgage insurance eligibility to revise requirements for the principal amount of a mortgage loan, in part increasing the amount of a mortgage that may be insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Repeals the requirement that certain mortgagors, before a mortgage is insured, complete a program of counseling on the responsibilities and financial management involved in homeownership. Increases high-cost area and project-based additional mortgage loan limits for FHA-insured mortgages for: (1) rental housing; (2) cooperative housing; (3) rehabilitation and neighborhood conservation housing insurance; (4) moderate income and displaced family housing; (5) housing for the elderly; and (6) condominiums.</summary>
