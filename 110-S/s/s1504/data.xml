  <summary>5/24/2007--Introduced.
Requires major integrated oil companies (i.e., companies with annual gross receipts over $1 billion and average daily worldwide production of crude oil of at least 500,000 barrels) to revalue their LIFO inventories of crude oil, natural gas, or any other petroleum product according to a specified formula. Exempts such companies from any penalties for underpayment of estimated tax resulting from the revaluation of their LIFO inventories.</summary>
