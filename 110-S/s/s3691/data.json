Grants the Federal Reserve Board authority over investment-bank holding companies. Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue final rules to: (1) designate clearinghouses for credit-default swaps; and (2) prohibit fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices in connection with such swaps.
