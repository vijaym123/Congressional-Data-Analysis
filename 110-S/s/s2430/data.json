Prohibits the filing of a civil action for damages against the Secretary or any officer in the exercise of their authority under this Act in any federal or state court. Requires a federally licensed pilot of a vessel to carry and use a laptop computer equipped with a navigation system in cases where state or local pilotage authorities determine that the use of such computer is practical and necessary."
