Limits to $15,000 per employee the amount of wages eligible for such credit in any calendar quarter. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a full tax deduction for business meal and entertainment expenses (normally, only 50% of such expenses are deductible) incurred in specified areas of the GO Zone prior to January 1, 2010. Extends through 2009: (1) the increased expensing allowance for GO Zone investment property; and (2) the work opportunity tax credit for hiring Hurricane Katrina employees. Extends through 2008 provisions allowing accelerated depreciation of qualified leasehold, restaurant, and retail improvement property located in specified areas of the GO Zone."
