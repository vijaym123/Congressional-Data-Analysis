    "text": "Domestic Offshore Energy Security Act of 2008, or the DOES Act - Permits United States persons to: (1) engage in exploration and extraction of hydrocarbon resources from any portion of any foreign exclusive economic zone contiguous to the exclusive economic zone of the United States; and (2) export without license authority all pertinent equipment for such activity. Amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize travel-related transactions for travel to, from, or within Cuba in connection with exploration and extraction of hydrocarbon resources in any part of a foreign maritime Exclusive Economic Zone contiguous to the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Identifies as persons authorized to travel to Cuba any full-time employees, executives, and agents and consultants of oil and gas producers, distributors, and shippers. Amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to: (1) repeal the moratorium on oil and gas leasing east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of Mexico; and (2) decrease to 45 miles within the coastline of Florida the moratorium on oil and gas leasing. Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations that establish environmental safeguards for oil and natural gas exploration and production on the outer Continental Shelf. Authorizes such Secretary to inventory the oil and natural gas resources beneath the waters of the outer Continental Shelf off the coasts of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, or Georgia, only if the respective state governor requests it. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to instruct the Secretary of Energy, in evaluating applications for enhanced oil and natural gas production through carbon dioxide injection, to grant priority consideration to applications carried out in geologically challenging fields. Requires the Secretaries of the Interior and of Energy (Secretaries) to suspend acquisition of petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during calendar 2008. Authorizes the Secretaries to resume such acquisition after the President notifies Congress that the weighted average price of petroleum in the United States for the most recent 90-day period is $75 or less per barrel."
