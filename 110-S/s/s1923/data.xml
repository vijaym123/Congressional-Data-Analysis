(Sec. 3) Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide financial assistance to the Housing Assistance Council to develop the ability and capacity of community-based housing development organizations to undertake community development and affordable housing projects and programs in rural areas. Authorizes the Housing Assistance Council to use such assistance for: (1) technical assistance, training, support, and advice to develop the business and administrative capabilities of rural community-based housing development organizations; and (2) loans, grants, or other financial assistance to such organizations to carry out community development and affordable housing activities for low- and moderate-income families. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2010. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary also to make a grant to the Raza Development Fund to provide technical and financial assistance to local nonprofit organizations to undertake similar projects and programs serving low- and moderate-income households, particularly through organizations in neighborhoods with substantial populations of income-disadvantaged households of Hispanic origin. Authorizes the Fund to use such assistance to: (1) provide technical and financial assistance for site acquisition and development, construction financing, and short- and long-term financing for housing, community facilities, and economic development; (2) leverage capital from private entities; and (3) provide technical assistance, training, support, and advice to develop the management, financial, and administrative capabilities of housing development organizations serving such low-income households. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2010. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary to make a grant to the Housing Partnership Network to create, sustain, and improve access to affordable housing and community facilities benefiting very low-, low- and moderate-income households and communities. Authorizes the Network to use such assistance to: (1) make investments, loans, and grants to its member nonprofits that demonstrate expertise in using such funds to leverage additional private capital to build, operate, finance, and sustain affordable housing and related community development facilities; (2) make investments in entities sponsored by the Network with the intent to leverage additional private capital to further the production capacity, sustainability, or efficiency of its members; and (3) pay for the expenses of the Network to administer and oversee such investments. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2010. Directs the Comptroller General to audit entities or organizations receiving such funds.
