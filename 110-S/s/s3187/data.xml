Requires the Secretary to establish an early disease research and management program targeted at the high incidence and mortality rates among minority and low income populations.Requires the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to coordinate with the Secretary in: (1) the development of the lung cancer mortality reduction program under this Act; (2) the implementation of an early detection and disease management research program for military personnel and veterans whose smoking history and exposure to carcinogens during active duty service has increased their risk for lung cancer; and (3) the implementation of coordinated care programs for military personnel and veterans diagnosed with lung cancer.Requires the Secretary to establish a Lung Cancer Advisory Board to monitor the programs established under this Act.</summary>
