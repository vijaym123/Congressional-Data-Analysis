  <summary>12/11/2008--Introduced.
Digital TV Transition Fairness Act - Requires the Department of Commerce to implement and administer a program to obtain coupons that can be applied toward: (1) the cost to install a digital-to-analog converter box; (2) the purchase and installation of an indoor or outdoor antenna, or both if needed, to facilitate the reception and display of signals of channels broadcast in digital television service; and (3) the cost to install, or the cost of any other equipment needed to receive and display, basic broadcast television service. Sets forth consumer and product eligibility criteria. Provides for a website and telephone hotline to provide relevant information to assist consumers that have degraded or lost signals or channels as a result of the full power transition from analog to digital television that is to occur on February 17, 2009. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to promulgate rules requiring that each multichannel video programming distributor providing broadcast television for a local market provide to eligible consumers in that local market access to basic broadcast television service. Directs the FCC to carry out an education and outreach campaign to inform and educate consumers on the availability, benefits, and advantages of the programs and requirements established under this Act.</summary>
