    "text": "Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury and Health Programs Improvement Act of 2007 - Title I: Traumatic Brain Injury - (Sec. 101) Expresses the sense of Congress that, among other things: (1) the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should have the capacity and expertise to provide veterans who have a traumatic brain injury (TBI) with health care, rehabilitation, and community integration; (2) family support is integral to the rehabilitation and community reintegration of such veterans; and (3) the VA should provide a system for life-long case management for such veterans. (Sec. 102) Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop individualized plans for the rehabilitation and reintegration of veterans with TBI, and to provide each plan to the individual before their discharge from inpatient care, following transition from active duty to the VA for outpatient care, or as soon as practicable following diagnosis. Requires each plan to be based upon a comprehensive assessment of: (1) the physical, cognitive, vocational, neuropsychological, and social impairments of the individual; and (2) the family education and support needs of the individual after discharge from inpatient care. Requires the Secretary to designate a case manager for each such veteran. Requires: (1) the involvement of family members in plan development; and (2) the Secretary to periodically evaluate plan effectiveness. (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with non-VA facilities to provide veterans' rehabilitative treatment and reintegration services when the Secretary is unable to provide such services or when the Secretary determines non-VA treatment is optimal with respect to the veteran's recovery and rehabilitation. (Sec. 104) Requires the Secretary to establish a program on research, education, and clinical care to provide intensive neuro-rehabilitation to veterans with severe TBI, including veterans in a minimally conscious state who would otherwise receive only long-term residential care. Authorizes appropriations. Requires a report from the Secretary to Congress on research conducted under the program. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to conduct a five-year pilot program to assess the effectiveness of providing assisted living services to veterans with TBI to enhance their rehabilitation, quality of life, and community integration.
