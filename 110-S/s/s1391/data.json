Requires such schools to: (1) participate in community-based efforts to coordinate educational, developmental, family, health, and other comprehensive services through community-based organizations and public and private partnerships; and (2) provide access to such services to students, families, and the community. Gives local grant priority to entities that: (1) will serve at least two full-service community schools eligible for schoolwide programs under the Act, and more than one full-service community school as part of a community or districtwide strategy; and (2) demonstrate a record of effectiveness in integrating at least three of various qualified services.
