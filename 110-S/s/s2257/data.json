    "text": "Burma Democracy Promotion Act of 2007 - States that it is U.S. policy to: (1) condemn the repression carried out by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC); (2) support a peaceful transition to constitutional democracy in Burma; and (3) hold accountable individuals responsible for the repression of peaceful political activity in Burma. Directs the President to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a list of: (1) SPDC officials who play or have played a substantial role in political repression in Burma or in the commission of human rights abuses; and (2) other Burmese SPDC supporters. Subjects persons so identified to U.S. entry prohibition and financial sanctions (blocked property, financial transaction prohibitions, and banking sanctions). Exempts medical and humanitarian assistance from such restrictions. Authorizes additional waivers for diplomatic and travel purposes. Terminates such prohibitions upon a presidential certification to the committees that the SPDC has: (1) released all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy; (2) entered into a dialogue with democratic forces led by the National League for Democracy and the ethnic minorities of Burma on transitioning to democratic government; and (3) allowed humanitarian access to populations affected by armed conflict in all regions of Burma. Amends the the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 to prohibit the importation into the United States of Burmese gems, teak, or other hardwood timber. Directs the President to appoint a Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma. Authorizes: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury to issue multi-year licenses for humanitarian or religious activities in Burma; and (2) the President to assist nonviolent democracy activists in their efforts to promote freedom, democracy, and human rights in Burma. Directs the Secretary of State to report to the appropriate committees respecting countries that provide military aid to Burma. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should lead U.N. Security Council efforts to impose an international arms embargo on Burma."
