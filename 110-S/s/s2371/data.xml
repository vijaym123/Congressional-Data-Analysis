  <summary>12/21/2007--Public Law.
Makes technical changes to amendments the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (the Act) made to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA). Specifies the untaxed income and benefits which the Act excluded from the list of untaxed income and benefits considered in federal student need analyses (thereby, specifically excluding them from such analyses). Provides that, for married borrowers who file separate tax returns, income-based loan repayments under the HEA shall be determined solely on the basis of the individual borrower's student loan debt and adjusted gross income. Amends the Act to make technical amendments with respect to Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants.</summary>
