    "text": "Water Infrastructure Revitalization Act - Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to establish a program to provide environmental assistance to non-federal interests in North Dakota, which may be provided in the form of design and construction assistance for water-related environmental infrastructure and resource protection and development projects. Requires projects to be publicly owned as a prerequisite for assistance. Directs the Secretary to enter into local cooperation agreements with non-federal interests for project design and construction. Sets the federal share of project costs under local cooperation agreements at 75%. Requires a reduction in the non-federal share of the cost of constructing projects under this Act, using a federal formula for water rate affordability, where the rate for affordability relating to the project area exceeds the average state-wide rate by a specified percentage. Sets the non-federal share of operation and maintenance costs for projects constructed with assistance under this Act at 100%."
