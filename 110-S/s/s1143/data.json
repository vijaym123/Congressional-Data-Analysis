Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Commandant of the Coast Guard, to develop a comprehensive management plan to provide long-term management guidance for the public land in the Area. Requires the Secretary to manage the Area as part of the National Landscape Conservation System. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into cooperative agreements with federal, state, county, other local government agencies, and other partners (including the Loxahatchee River Historical Society) for the long-term management of the Area; and (2) acquire for inclusion in the Area any state or private land or any interest in state or private land that is adjacent to the Area and identified in the management plan as appropriate for acquisition."
