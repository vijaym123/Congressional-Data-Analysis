Directs the Administrator to use information and services provided by publishers and providers of trade processing services to the maximum extent practicable.Prohibits: (1) knowingly providing to the Administrator false information relating to the price or quantity of emission allowances sold, purchased, transferred, banked, or borrowed with the intent to fraudulently affect the data; (2) using, in connection with the purchase or sale of an emission allowance, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of regulations prescribed to protect the public interest or consumers; or (3) cheating or defrauding another market participant, client, or customer. Directs the Administrator to monitor trading to prevent false reporting, manipulation, and fraud.Requires the Administrator, to prevent excessive speculation, to adopt limitations on: (1) the quantity of trading transactions allowed and the positions that may be held in any emission allowance market; and (2) emission allowance auctions. Sets penalties for violations."
