Requires that any children's product (any consumer product marketed for use by, or foreseeably substantially used by, children under the age of seven) that contains lead be treated as a banned hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Applies the prohibitions contained in specified provisions of that Act without regard to whether the lead contained in such children's product is accessible to children.</summary>
