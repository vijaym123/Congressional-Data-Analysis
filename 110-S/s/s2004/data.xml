  <summary>12/12/2007--Reported to Senate without amendment.
Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to designate, establish, and operate at least six Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health-care facilities as locations for epilepsy centers of excellence. Requires the Under Secretary for Health of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to establish a peer review panel to assess the scientific and clinical merit of proposals for the designation of such centers. Prohibits the Secretary from designating a VA facility as a center of excellence unless the peer review panel has determined that the proposal submitted by such facility is among those that meet the highest competitive standards of scientific and clinical merit. Requires the Secretary to designate a VHA national coordinator for epilepsy programs to: (1) supervise the operation of the centers; (2) coordinate and support throughout the VA health-care system better access to diagnosis, research, care, and education for epilepsy and traumatic brain injury; and (3) conduct regular evaluations of the centers. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
