Requires the Secretary to: (1) contract with an experienced external agency to evaluate the effectiveness of school leadership zones in recruiting, training, and retraining school leaders and improving student achievement; and (2) award an additional grant to partnership grantees that successfully create model school leadership zones so that they can revise school leader certification or licensure requirements in order to replicate the practices of such zones in other LEAs within their states."
