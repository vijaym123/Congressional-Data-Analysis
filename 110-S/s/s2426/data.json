Expresses the sense of Congress that any bilateral agreement between the United States and Iraq involving \"commitments or risks affecting the nation as a whole,\" including a status of forces agreement (SOFA), that is not a treaty approved by two-thirds of the Senate under Article II of the Constitution or authorized by legislation does not have the force of law. Prohibits the use of funds to carry out such an agreement."
