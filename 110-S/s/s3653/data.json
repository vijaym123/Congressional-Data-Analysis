Defines \"dairy product\" as: (1) fluid milk; (2) cheese, including cottage cheese and cream cheese; (3) yogurt; (4) ice cream; (5) butter; and (6) any other dairy product. Requires the retailer of a covered commodity that is a dairy product to designate such commodity's country of origin as each country in which: (1) one or more of the commodity's components or ingredients were produced, originated, or sourced; and (2) the commodity was processed. Provides that with respect to a covered commodity that is a dairy product produced exclusively in the United States, retailer designation of the U.S. state, region, or locality of the commodity's production shall be sufficient to identify the United States as the country of origin."
