Reduces the military retirement eligibility age in the case of a person who serves in the reserves on active duty in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, below 60 years of age by six months for each 90 days that the person so serves. Prohibits such eligibility age from being reduced below 50. Requires that, if a member of the reserves requires treatment for more than 30 days for a wound or injury incurred on active duty, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall transfer such member to a treatment facility that is not more than 30 miles from either the hometown or permanent duty station of the member, as elected by such member. Requires a member of the reserves who travels more than 50 miles for drill, instruction, or annual training duty to be reimbursed for the costs of such travel."
