Directs the President to certify to the appropriate congressional committees when the government of Saudi Arabia: (1) is fully cooperating with the United States in investigating and preventing terrorist attacks; (2) has permanently closed all Saudi-based Wahhabbist organizations that fund Islamic extremism; (3) has exercised maximum efforts to block all funding from private Saudi citizens, corporations, and entities to foreign Islamic extremist and terrorist movements; and (4) has stopped financing and disseminating materials and other forms of support that encourage the spread of radical Wahhabi ideology. Directs the President to report annually to the committees until such certification is made."
