Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into an agreement to strengthen cooperation on seafood safety, including regarding examining and testing seafood imports, inspections of foreign facilities, technical assistance and training of foreign facilities for marine aquaculture, establishing a distribution chain tracking system, and labeling. Directs the Secretary to increase the number of laboratories certified to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards. Authorizes the Secretary to increase the number and capacity of laboratories operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) involved in testing and other activities under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) refuse admission of all imports of seafood or seafood products originating from a country or exporter if the shipments do not meet Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) requirements; and (2) order an increase in the percentage of seafood shipments tested that originate from a country that may not meet the federal requirements. Allows admittance of individual shipments from that country or exporter on evidence from an inspection or a certified laboratory. Authorizes the Secretary to send inspectors to an originating country or exporter to assess seafood practices and processes and to provide technical assistance related to FDCA requirements."
