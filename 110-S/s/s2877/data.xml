Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life Act of 2008 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to expand and intensify CDC's cancer control programs. Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide guidance to states, in collaboration with the Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), on interventions that may be incorporated into state cancer control programs to improve the long-term health status of childhood cancer survivors; (2) encourage states to incorporate strategies for improving their care into their comprehensive cancer plans; (3) collaborate with the NCI Director to improve or develop systems for tracking cancer survivors; and (4) enhance control programs to include a focus on childhood cancer survivorship. Directs the NCI Director to: (1) coordinate National Institutes of Health (NIH) activities regarding cancer survivorship; (2) make grants for research regarding pediatric cancer survivors and health disparities in cancer survivorship within minority populations; (3) conduct or support research to evaluate follow-up care for childhood cancer survivors; and (4) make grants to establish pilot programs to develop, study, or evaluate model systems for monitoring and caring for cancer survivors. Directs the Secretary to make grants to: (1) establish or improve training programs for health care professionals to improve follow-up care for young cancer survivors and to ensure that such care is linguistically and culturally competent; (2) pay costs incurred during the first four years of operating a clinic for comprehensive long-term followup services for childhood cancer survivors; and (3) improve physical and psychosocial care for such survivors.</summary>
