Protecting English in the Workplace Act - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to declare that, notwithstanding any other equal employment opportunity provisions of the Act, it is not an unlawful employment practice for an employer to require an employee to speak, or an applicant for employment to agree to speak, English while engaged in work. Prohibits considering an individual to be engaged in work during a bona fide meal period, rest period, or any other break during which the individual is not required to perform any duties.</summary>
