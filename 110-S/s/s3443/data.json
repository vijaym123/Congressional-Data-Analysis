Requires states or the Administrator to give priority to financially distressed communities. Requires the Administrator, no later than December 31, 2010, (currently, 2003) and periodically thereafter, to report to Congress on recommended funding levels for sewer overflow control grants.Requires the Administrator to update the guidance entitled \"Combined Sewer Overflows -- Guidance for Financial Capability Assessment and Schedule Development\" dated February 1997, to ensure that the evaluations by the Administrator of financial capability assessment and schedule development meet specified criteria, including criteria used in assessing financial capability of a community to make investments necessary to make water quality-related improvements and in implementing water quality-related improvements.Requires such updated guidance to indicate that it is appropriate for the reconsideration and modification of financial capability determinations and implementation schedules to be based on such criteria."
