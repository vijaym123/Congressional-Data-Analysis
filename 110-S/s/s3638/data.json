Designates the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the lead agency for Program planning, management, and coordination. (Repeals provisions regarding the existing Interagency Working Group responsible for Program planning, management, and coordination.)Establishes the Interagency Working Group on Wind Impact Reduction (IWG) to coordinate activities and facilitate communication among Program agencies in reducing the impacts of windstorms. Requires the Director of NIST to: (1) establish a Program Office to ensure coordination and synergy across Program agencies; (2) prepare the Program's annual budget; (3) facilitate preparation of the IWG's biennial report to Congress and the National Science and Technology Council; (4) support research and development for building codes and standards; (5) promote implementation of research results; (6) support deployment of interagency teams to investigate major windstorm events and data collection and analysis; and (7) participate in, coordinate, or support other Program mitigation activities.Sets forth: (1) the duties of the Program Office and of the IWG (including preparation of an interim working plan for Program operations and a strategic plan for achieving Program objectives); and (2) supportive roles of the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Army Corps of Engineers.
