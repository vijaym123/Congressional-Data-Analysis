Requires the Secretary to update the model plan for the designation of trauma centers and for triage, transfer, and transportation policies. (Sec. 8) Prohibits the Secretary from making trauma grants to a state unless the state submits to the Secretary any changes to, and any plans to address deficiencies in, the trauma care component.
