Defines \"eligible debt financing instrument\" to mean a bond or other debt financing instrument (including a note, certificate, mortgage, or lease agreement) issued by an Indian tribe, the proceeds of which are used for construction of an authorized Indian tribal municipal, rural, or industrial water project. Allows the Secretary to reimburse an Indian tribe for a project funded by an eligible debt financing instrument if the project is being carried out by the Indian tribe pursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement with the Secretary in accordance with the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Limits the federal cost share for a project under this Act to the federal cost share for the project as determined under the authorizing statute."
