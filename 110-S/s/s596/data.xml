Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to promulgate regulations to establish policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent the introduction or completion of restricted transactions with unlicensed Internet pharmacies into a designated payment system.Requires the Secretary to provide for a system to identify and report Internet pharmacy websites in violation of federal or state law.Prohibits: (1) the ownership or operation of an Internet pharmacy in violation of this Act; and (2) the representation by an Internet pharmacy that a prescription drug may be obtained without a prescription.
