Public Land Military Pass Act - Makes the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass, as provided in this Act, available at a discount (subject to the same rate of increase as the regular cost of the Pass) to any veterans and active duty and reserve members of the U.S. Armed Forces determined to be eligible for such a discount. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (with respect to federal land management agencies) and the Secretary of Agriculture (with respect to the Forest Service), after consultation with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense, to determine the appropriate documentation that a veteran or an active duty or reserve member shall provide as proof that the veteran or member is eligible for the discount. Makes a National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass issued under this Act valid for one year after the date of issuance.</summary>
