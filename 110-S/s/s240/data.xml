  <summary>2/15/2007--Reported to Senate without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 2007 - Amends the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 to extend deadlines for development of a five-year strategic plan for the geologic mapping program and for appointment of the advisory committee. Removes from program objectives the development of a geophysical- and geochemical- map database. Directs that mapping priorities be based in part on the needs of the Department of the Interior land management agencies. Modifies the composition of the advisory committee and increases the number of members on such committee. Requires the advisory committee to provide a scientific overview of geologic maps (including maps of geologic-based hazards) used or disseminated by federal agencies for regulation or land-use planning. Directs that the national geologic map database include all maps developed with funding provided by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, including under the federal, state, and education components. Authorizes appropriations for each of FY2007 through FY2016. Increases the percentages allocated for the state and education components.</summary>
