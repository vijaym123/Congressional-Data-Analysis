Establishes in the Treasury the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Trust Fund. Appropriates to such Fund amounts equal to 25% of the additional revenues received due to the disallowance of the depletion allowance for hardrock mines proposed by this Act. Prescribes guidelines under which such Fund shall be available to the Secretary of the Interior for reclamation and restoration of lands and water resources adversely affected by mineral and mineral material mining (excluding coal and fluid minerals)."
