Requires the appropriate federal banking agencies and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to promulgate rules designed to: (1) avoid systemic risks to the financial markets; (2) ensure safe and sound operation of banks, including mandatory maintenance of sufficient capital levels and limits on aggregate leverage, and restrictions on buying, selling, or entering into derivatives by an insured depository institution for its own account; and (3) provide means to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative practices."
