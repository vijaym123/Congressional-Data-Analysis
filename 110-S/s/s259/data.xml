  <summary>1/11/2007--Introduced.
Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award a grant to the University of Hawaii Academy for Creative Media for the establishment, maintenance, and periodic modernization of the Henry Kuualoha Giugni Kupuna Memorial Archives at the University of Hawaii. Requires the Archives to use grant funds for: (1) facilities and equipment to house and provide computer and web access to a repository of Native Hawaiian historical data; (2) scholarships to assist disadvantaged students in attending college; (3) the creation of educational materials from the archives that are applicable to a broad range of indigenous students; (4) outreach to elementary and secondary school students; (5) teacher training, so that the teaching of kindergarten through grade 12 students is culturally congruent with the learning modalities of such students, particularly indigenous students; and (6) the enhancement of the economic and financial literacy of college students.</summary>
