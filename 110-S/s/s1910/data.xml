Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude any amount derived from an investment of federal grant or related state matching amounts made in connection with any revolving fund established under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act from a determination of whether a bond is an arbitrage bond (thus allowing states to retain arbitrage earnings from state revolving loan funds).</summary>
