Provides that nothing in federal reclamation law prohibits the concurrent crediting of revenue towards payment of the Conduit.Requires any project rates charged for water for municipal, domestic, or industrial use or for the use of facilities for the storage or delivery of water to be adjusted to reflect the estimated revenue derived from contracts for the use of project excess capacity or exchange contracts using project facilities.Authorizes appropriations for the construction of the Conduit. Prohibits such sums from being used for its operation or maintenance."
