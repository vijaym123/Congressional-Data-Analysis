  <summary>5/14/2007--Introduced.
Drug Sentencing Reform Act of 2007 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to to decrease mandatory minimum sentencing thresholds for powder cocaine and increase such thresholds for crack cocaine. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and amend federal sentencing guidelines to: (1) reflect changes to mandatory minimum sentences made by this Act; (2) provide increased sentences for defendants who use violence or weapons in the course of a drug trafficking offense or who play an active role in the commission of such offenses; and (3) limit sentencing for defendants who play a lesser role in the commission of drug offenses and who receive little or no compensation from their crime. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to carry out a pilot program for home detention of nonviolent prisoners age 65 or older.</summary>
