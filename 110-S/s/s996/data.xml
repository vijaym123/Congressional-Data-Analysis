  <summary>10/2/2008--Public Law.
Allows a passenger facility fee imposed at a large hub airport (that is subject to an amended judgment and final order in condemnation filed on January 7, 1980, by the Superior Court of the State of California for the county of Los Angeles) to be used as an eligible project cost to carry out noise mitigation for certain school buildings in the noise impacted area surrounding the airport if: (1) the buildings are adversely affected by airport noise; (2) the buildings are owned owned or chartered by the school district that was the plaintiff in case number 986,442 or 986,446, which was resolved by such judgment and final order; (3) the project is for a school identified in one of the settlement agreements effective February 16, 2005, between the airport and each of the school districts; (4) in the case of a project to replace a relocatable building with a permanent building, the eligible project costs are limited to actual structural construction costs necessary to mitigate aircraft noise in instructional classrooms to an interior noise level that meet Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards; and (5) the project otherwise meets requirements for authorization of a passenger facility fee.</summary>
