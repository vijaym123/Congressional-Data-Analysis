  <summary>5/8/2007--Introduced.
Worker Empowerment Act - Amends the Social Security Act to require each state to implement a reemployment adjustment assistance program that provides payment of 50% of the amount by which the wages received by an individual at the time of his or her separation from employment exceeds (if at all) the wages received by such individual from reemployment. Amends the Internal Revenue Code (relating to employment taxes) to impose a wage insurance contribution excise tax on every employer. Establishes a Wage Insurance Trust Fund in the Treasury, to which the equivalent of any such taxes received shall be appropriated to carry out this Act.</summary>
