Eliminates the 20,000 annual cap on aliens with master's or higher degrees who can enter the United States without being subject to H-1B visa limits. Exempts from direct numerical limitations: (1) aliens with an advanced degree in science, technology, engineering, or math who have been working in a related field in the United States during the three-year period preceding their application for an employment-based immigrant visa; (2) certain aliens who are priority workers or who have received a national interest waiver; and (3) immediate relatives."
