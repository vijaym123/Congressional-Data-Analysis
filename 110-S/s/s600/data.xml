  <summary>2/14/2007--Introduced.
School-Based Health Clinic Establishment Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants for the cost of operating school-based health clinics (SBHCs) to provide comprehensive primary health services during school hours to children and adolescents by health professionals. Requires SBHCs to: (1) provide services to children and adolescents for whom parental or guardian consent has been obtained; (2) provide on-site access during the academic day when school is in session and 24-hour coverage through an on-call system and backup health providers to ensure access to services on a year-round basis when the school or SBHC is closed. Allows the Secretary to: (1) give preference to applicants who demonstrate an ability to serve populations of children and adolescents that have historically demonstrated difficulty in accessing health and mental health services; and (2) waive certain requirements under this Act for a designated period.Requires the Secretary to establish a program to provide technical and other assistance to SBHCs.</summary>
