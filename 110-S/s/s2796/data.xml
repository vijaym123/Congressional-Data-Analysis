Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of using community-based organizations to ensure that veterans receive needed care and benefits by: (1) increasing the coordination of providers of health care and benefits for veterans to assist veterans transitioning from military service to civilian life; (2) increasing the availability of high-quality medical and mental health services to transitioning veterans; and (3) providing assistance to families to help them adjust to such veterans in their transition.</summary>
