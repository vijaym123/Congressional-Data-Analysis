    "text": "Affordable Housing Expansion and Public Safety Act - Instructs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Secretary) to provide an additional 100,000 incremental vouchers for tenant-based rental housing assistance under the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program in FY2008. Amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to direct: (1) each participating jurisdiction to use Home Investments Partnership (HOME) grant funds to provide affordable housing to individuals or families whose income is 30% or lower than the area median income (extremely low-income); and (2) direct the Secretary to allocate HOME funds to such jurisdictions on a specified pro-rata basis. Amends the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to: (1) extend to FY2012 the authorization of appropriations for the Public and Assisted Housing Crime and Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP); (2) set aside specified amounts for the Office of Policy Development and Research; (3) identify activities eligible for grant funds; and (4) require the Office to review research to assess strategies likely to be effective in preventing and reducing violent and drug-related crimes in public and federally assisted low-income housing. Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress shall create a national affordable housing trust fund to supply 1.5 million additional affordable housing units over the next 10 years, especially for extremely low-income and very low-income families. Repeals multiyear procurement authority for the F-22A Raptor Fighter Aircraft. Prohibits the Secretary of Energy from implementing the advanced research program for fossil fuels."
