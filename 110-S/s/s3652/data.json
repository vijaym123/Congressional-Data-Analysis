Establishes the Office of the Inspector General for Financial Markets Oversight to: (1) conduct, supervise, and coordinate investigations into whether ethics violations or conflicts of interest between regulators and their regulated entities or markets may have affected agency decision-making between January 2002 and August 2008; and (2) use the forum of the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency to share findings and best practices with regards to ethics, conflicts of interest, oversight, and accountability."
