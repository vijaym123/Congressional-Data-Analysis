  <summary>3/26/2007--Reported to Senate amended.
Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007 - Amends the federal criminal code to make it unlawful to knowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal in an animal fighting venture if any animal in the venture was moved in interstate or foreign commerce. Prohibits knowingly: (1) sponsoring or exhibiting a bird in a fighting venture in a state where it would not otherwise be a violation of the law if the person knew that any bird in the venture was knowingly bought, sold, delivered, transported, or received in interstate or foreign commerce for such purpose; (2) selling, buying, transporting, delivering, or receiving for purposes of transportation, in interstate or foreign commerce, any dog or other animal to participate in an animal fighting venture; (3) using the mails or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for commercial speech to promote an animal fighting venture, except as performed outside the limits of the states (with an exception for bird fights in states whose laws allow them); or (4) selling, buying, transporting, or delivering in interstate or foreign commerce a knife, gaff, or other sharp instrument for attachment to the leg of a bird for use in an animal fighting venture. Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to three years for violations. Repeals lesser penalties imposed by the Animal Welfare Act.</summary>
