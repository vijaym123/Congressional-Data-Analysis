  <summary>6/5/2008--Introduced.
Helping Our Veterans to Keep Their Homes Act of 2008 - Increases from 90% to 100% of the reasonable value of a veteran's dwelling or farm residence the amount of the loan to be guaranteed or made in the case of a loan to refinance certain loans. Prohibits collecting a fee from a veteran for a housing loan, unless the loan is used to refinance indebtedness. Changes the loan fee for such loans to 1% of the total amount of the loan guaranteed, insured, or made, or in the case of a loan assumption, the unpaid principal balance of the loan on the date of the transfer of the property. Extends the demonstration projects involving: (1) adjustable rate mortgages through FY2018; and (2) hybrid adjustable rate through FY2012. Increases the maximum loan guaranty amount of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) conforming limit limitation determined for a single-family residence, as adjusted for the year involved. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to review and streamline the process of guaranteeing home loans for the purchase of a condominium. Increases the maximum guaranty amount for certain refinanced loans or other liens. Sets, for a veteran whose income is below an amount set by the Secretary, the maximum amount of guaranty entitlement available for a home loan in any amount at the greater of: (1) the guaranty amount for veterans whose income is not below such amount set by the Secretary; or (2) 30% of the loan.</summary>
