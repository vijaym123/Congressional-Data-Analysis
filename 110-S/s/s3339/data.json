Allows only public and private nonprofit institutions of higher education to participate in a VA program of public-private contributions for additional educational assistance for such veterans. Requires participating colleges and universities to: (1) report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on the manner in which the college or university would provide such additional assistance, and the amount provided to each participant; and (2) provide the same amount of additional assistance to all veterans receiving assistance at such college or university. Requires the VA to ensure that the Post-9/11 educational assistance program can be implemented by August 1, 2009. Provides authority for interim regulations."
