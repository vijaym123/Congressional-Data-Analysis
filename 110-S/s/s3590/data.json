Requires the Secretary, in providing such grants, to give priority to rural LEAs that: (1) are transporting students in a bus manufactured before 1977; (2) have a strained fleet of school buses; or (3) serve a school required by law to provide transportation to students to enable them to transfer to another public school served by the rural LEA. Authorizes the Secretary to use up to 5% of formula grants for non-urbanized areas to carry out this Act."
