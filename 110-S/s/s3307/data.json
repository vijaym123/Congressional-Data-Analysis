Requires the Secretary, after receiving such data, to: (1) compile a list of all benefits for which each member or veteran may be eligible; (2) notify the member or veteran (or their legal representative) of such benefits; and (3) provide a second notification if the member or veteran does not apply for a listed benefit within 60 days, as well as annual notifications thereafter. Requires additional notifications based on changed circumstances. Allows each member or veteran the option to decline further notifications. Directs the Secretary to use transferred data to reduce the amount of information that a member or veteran must provide when applying for benefits. Requires the Secretary of Defense to provide a member or veteran the opportunity to decline authorization for the transfer of information under this Act."
