  <summary>8/2/2007--Introduced.
Amends title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to direct the Secretary of Education to award grants to states for subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to assist low-achieving, high-need schools that serve a high proportion of low-income students in implementing: (1) comprehensive, coherent, high-quality induction and mentoring programs for teachers during at least their first two years of full-time teaching; and (2) ongoing, high-impact professional development programs for teachers, principals, and administrators. Requires the induction and professional development programs to be: (1) integrated and aligned; (2) aligned with the state's school improvement efforts under title I of the ESEA; and (3) subject to a formal evaluation conducted by the state, institutions of higher education, or external agencies experienced in qualitative research. Permits LEAs to use school improvement funds under title I of the ESEA to supplement this Act's induction and professional development program grants.</summary>
