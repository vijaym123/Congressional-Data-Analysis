Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to include a workforce component to enable employers, researchers, and health officials to: (1) assess employee health risks; (2) identify emerging problems associated with general employee health; (3) prevent disease within the employee population; and (4) improve employer-based health programs and policies. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director, to award grants for research demonstration projects to study the effect of new worksite-based health interventions and models. Directs the Secretary to carry out activities to implement guidelines or recommendations resulting from such projects."
