Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to: (1) conduct an educational campaign on employer-based wellness programs; (2) develop an annual awards program for employers to encourage the development of creative and effective solutions to help employees maintain or improve their health; (3) enter into contracts with entities to provide employers with technical assistance in evaluating wellness programs; and (4) conduct a national worksite health policies and programs study to assess employer-based health policies and programs. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to include a workforce component to enable employers, researchers, and health officials to: (1) assess employee health risks; (2) identify emerging problems associated with general employee health; (3) prevent disease within the employee population; and (4) improve employer-based health programs and policies. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director, to award grants for research demonstration projects to study the effect of new worksite-based health interventions and models. Directs the Secretary to carry out activities to implement guidelines or recommendations resulting from such projects.</summary>
