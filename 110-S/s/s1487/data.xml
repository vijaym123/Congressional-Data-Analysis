Prohibits any Internet connection for components of any voting device. Requires security standards for voting systems used in federal elections. Requires laboratories to meet standards prohibiting conflicts of interest as a condition of accreditation for testing of voting system hardware and software. Requires each state to establish standards for local jurisdictions to use in conducting election audits. Requires the Commission to establish an Audit Guidelines Development Task Force. Adds federal election requirements pertaining, among other things, to absentee voting and third-party registration. Requires the EAC to study the equitable distribution of voting systems, poll workers, and election resources. Prohibits campaign activities by Chief State Election Officials. Outlines standards for purging voters from voter registration lists, including restoration of erroneously purged voters. Requires each state to promulgate uniform, nondiscriminatory procedures allowing polling place access to international and domestic election observers. Provides for early voting.
