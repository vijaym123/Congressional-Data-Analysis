  <summary>6/7/2007--Introduced.
Early Childhood Investment Act of 2007 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award a three-to-five-year grant to not more than one public-private partnership in each state to promote school readiness by improving the quality of, and access to, early childhood development opportunities for children throughout the state from birth to kindergarten. Requires each partnership to include the state and at least one tax-exempt organization and be led by a board of directors. Reduces the federal share of the cost of activities assisted under this Act from 50% in the first year of a grant to 30% in the third and any succeeding year of the grant.</summary>
