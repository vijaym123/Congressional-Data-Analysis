  <summary>3/5/2007--Introduced.
National Mathematics and Science Consistency Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to convene and oversee a panel to produce, for kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12), voluntary national expectations for science and mathematics education, promising practices in teaching such subjects, and sample assessment questions based on the expectations. Requires such expectations to be based on core ideas in mathematics and science education common to all states, and the promising teaching practices to be developed by identifying proven and effective teaching materials or the need for new materials. Requires the panel also to develop and coordinate professional development criteria that would prepare teachers to incorporate such expectations into their teaching. Requires the Secretary to award grants to states to: (1) develop instructional materials based on the promising practices in teaching mathematics and science; (2) ensure that the infrastructure and technical assistance to provide such instructional materials online and free of charge to school personnel is available; and (3) train K-12 mathematics and science teachers to use the instructional materials and assessment questions in teaching.</summary>
