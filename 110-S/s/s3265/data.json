Establishes a new formula for payment of such services (other than a covered osteoporosis drug) as the lesser of: (1) the reasonable cost of such services; or (2) the customary charges for them. Requires such services to be free of charge or at only a nominal charge if they are furnished by a public service provider or by another provider a significant portion of whose patients are low-income."
