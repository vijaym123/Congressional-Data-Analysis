    "text": "Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 - Title I: Substance Use Disorders and Mental Health Care - (Sec. 101) Enacts this title in tribute to Justin Bailey, who, after returning to the United States from service in Operation Iraqi Freedom, died in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) domiciliary facility while receiving care for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a substance use disorder. (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure the provision of the following services and treatment to each veteran enrolled in the VA health care system and in need of services and treatment for a substance use disorder: (1) screening for substance use disorder in all settings, including primary care; (2) short-term motivational counseling; (3) marital and family counseling; (4) intensive outpatient or residential care; (5) relapse prevention; (6) ongoing aftercare and outpatient counseling; (7) opiate substitution therapy; (8) pharmacological treatments to reduce cravings for drugs and alcohol; (9) detoxification and stabilization; (10) coordination with groups providing peer-to-peer counseling; and (11) such other services as considered appropriate by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to ensure that amounts available for such care are allocated to ensure a full continuum of such care, treatment, or services to all veterans without regard to the location of their residences. (Sec. 104) Requires the Secretary to ensure that treatment for a substance use disorder and a comorbid mental health disorder is provided concurrently through a health professional with training and expertise in the treatment of both disorders, by separate services for each disorder, or by a team of experienced clinicians. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to conduct a two-year pilot program on the feasibility and advisability of providing veterans who seek treatment for substance use disorders access to a computer-based self-assessment, education, and treatment program through a secure Internet website operated by the Secretary. Makes eligible for such program volunteer veterans who have served in Operations Enduring Freedom or Iraqi Freedom. Requires a program report from the Secretary to Congress. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 106) Requires the Secretary to conduct a: (1) review of all Veterans Health Administration (VHA) residential mental health care facilities; and (2) follow-up review, within two years after the first review, to evaluate any improvements made or problems remaining with respect to such facilities. Requires a report from the Secretary to the veterans' committees after the initial review. (Sec. 107) Directs the Secretary to conduct a three-year pilot program on the provision of the following services to veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, particularly to those who served as a member of the National Guard or Reserve: (1) peer outreach; (2) peer support provided by licensed providers or veterans with personal experience with mental illness; (3) readjustment counseling; and (4) other mental health services. Requires: (1) the Secretary to conduct training programs for veterans and clinicians providing such services; (2) annual reports to the Secretary from entities participating in the program; and (3) the Secretary to design and implement a strategy for evaluating the program. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Mental Health Research - (Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary to carry out a program of research into comorbid PTSD and substance use disorder through the National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 202) Amends the Veterans' Health Care Act of 1984 to extend through 2012 (currently, 2008) the reporting requirement for the Special Committee on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Title III: Assistance For Families of Veterans - (Sec. 301) Includes marriage and family counseling within authorized VA care for veterans. (Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to carry out, through a non-VA entity, a three-year pilot program (with authorized one-year extensions) to assess the feasibility and advisability of providing readjustment and transition assistance to veterans and their families in cooperation with ten VA Vet Centers. Requires a report from the Secretary to the veterans' committees at the conclusion of the pilot program. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: Health Care Matters - (Sec. 401) Repeals a requirement that the Secretary adjust the amounts deducted from payments or allowances made by the VA for beneficiary travel expenses in connection with health care whenever the payment or allowance is adjusted. Requires the Secretary, in determining the amount of travel reimbursement, to use the mileage reimbursement rate for the use of privately owned vehicles by government employees on official business. Authorizes the Secretary to use a rate in excess of such rate, subject to the availability of appropriations. Requires a report from the Secretary to the veterans' committees on additional costs incurred by the VA due to implementation of this section. (Sec. 402) Requires (under current law, authorizes) the Secretary to reimburse a veteran for the costs of emergency treatment received in a non-VA facility prior to transfer to a VA facility. (Sec. 403) Directs the Secretary to carry out a three-year pilot program to provide, through qualifying non-VA health care providers, VA-authorized hospital care or medical, rehabilitative, or preventive health services to veterans who reside in highly rural areas. Requires annual reports during the program period from the Secretary to the veterans' committees assessing the program. (Sec. 404) Directs the Secretary to designate at least four and up to six VA health-care facilities as locations for epilepsy centers of excellence. Requires the: (1) VA's Under Secretary for Health to establish a peer review panel to assess the scientific and clinical merit of proposals submitted for designation as such a center; and (2) Secretary to follow the panel's determinations in making designations. Directs the Secretary to designate an individual in the VHA as a national coordinator for VHA epilepsy programs. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 405) Establishes as qualifications for appointment as a peer specialist within the VHA that the person: (1) be a veteran who has recovered or is recovering from a mental health condition; and (2) is certified as having met the criteria for such position. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with nonprofit entities to provide peer specialist training and certification for veterans. (Sec. 406) Directs the Secretary to establish up to seven patient accounting centers for conducting industry-modeled regionalized VA billing and collection activities. (Sec. 407) Amends the Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 to repeal a limitation on VA authority to conduct HIV testing in connection with the care of certain patients. (Sec. 408) Requires the Secretary to provide comprehensive health care coverage through the VA for a child of a Vietnam veteran who is suffering from spina bifida. (Current law requires the Secretary to provide such child such health care as the Secretary determines is needed by the child for the spina bifida or any disability associated with such condition.) (Sec. 409) Prohibits the Secretary from collecting a copayment from a veteran being furnished inpatient or outpatient hospice care by the VA. Title V: Pain Care - (Sec. 501) Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and implement a comprehensive policy on the management of pain experienced by veterans enrolled for VA health care services; (2) periodically update the policy; and (3) report annually through FY2018 to the veterans' committees on such policy. Title VI: Homeless Veterans Matters - (Sec. 601) Increases from $130 million to $150 million the annual authorization of appropriations for VA comprehensive service programs for homeless veterans. (Sec. 602) Revises provisions establishing a demonstration program of referral and counseling services for at-risk veterans transitioning from institutional living to: (1) remove the \"demonstration\" designation; (2) require the program to be carried out in at least 12 (currently, six) locations; and (3) extend the program through FY2012. (Sec. 603) Requires the Secretary to ensure that VA domiciliary care programs are adequate, with respect to capacity and safety, to meet the needs of women veterans. (Sec. 604) Directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance to eligible entities (private nonprofit organizations or consumer cooperatives) to provide and coordinate the provision of supportive services for very low-income veteran families occupying permanent housing.
