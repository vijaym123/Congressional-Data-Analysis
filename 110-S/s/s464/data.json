    "text": "Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop and report to Congress on outcome standards and measures to evaluate the performance of health care programs and projects that provide end-of-life care to individuals, and assess access to, and utilization of, such programs and projects. Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress on all matters relating to the establishment and implementation of a national uniform policy on advanced directives for individuals receiving items and services under titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA). Amends SSA titles XVIII and XIX to: (1) require service providers and eligible organizations to provide an appropriately trained professional for discussing advance directive issues with all adult individuals receiving medical care by or through such entities; and (2) ensure that an advance directive valid in one state will be honored in another state. Requires the Secretary, through the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to: (1) operate a clearinghouse and a 24-hour toll-free telephone hotline to provide consumer information about advance directives, end-of-life decision making, and available end-of-life and hospice care services; and (2) conduct a demonstration project to develop new and innovative approaches to providing end-of-life care to Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP (SSA title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance)) beneficiaries. Establishes within HHS an End-of-Life Care Advisory Board."
