(Sec. 4) Sets forth provisions: (1) governing continued operations at the Grand River Ditch; and (2) concerning the Alva B. Adams Tunnel and other Colorado-Big Thompson Project facilities. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish an alignment line and identify the boundaries for the East Shore Trail within the East Shore Trail Area.

Includes any portion of the Area that is not traversed by the Trail, that is not west of the Trail, and that is not within 50 feet of the centerline of the Trail in such Wilderness. Prohibits any use of motorized vehicles and other motorized machinery in the Area that was not permitted on March 1, 2006. Requires the Area, until the Secretary authorizes the construction of the Trail and the use of it for non-motorized bicycles, to be managed to: (1) protect any wilderness characteristics; and (2) maintain the suitability of the Area for inclusion in the Wilderness.(Sec. 6) Amends the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area, the Arapaho National Recreation Area and the Oregon Islands Wilderness Area Act to adjust the boundaries of: (1) the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area; and (2) the Arapaho National Recreation Area.
