Requires the organization to establish a Medicare quality accountability program. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, to contract with an entity to conduct a medical review audit to evaluate whether quality improvement organizations are making appropriate noncompliance determinations and sanction recommendations to the Secretary regarding health care practitioners and providers with respect to a corrective action plan. Revises requirements for the quality improvement program (QIO), including program administration, data disclosure, use of evaluation and competition, quality improvement organization program funding, and qualifications for QIOs under part B (Peer Review) of SSA title XI."
