  <summary>12/11/2007--Introduced.
Amends the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 to provide that the Secretary of Agriculture shall not be required to obligate funds to cover the cost of canceling a Forest Service stewardship multiyear contract until the contract is canceled. Authorizes cancellation costs to be paid from: (1) appropriations originally made available for the contract's performance; (2) appropriations currently available for procurement of the type of service concerned and not otherwise obligated; or (3) funds appropriated for payments for such performance or procurement. Provides that in a case in which payment or obligation of such funds would constitute an "Anti-Deficiency Act" violation the Secretary may: (1) seek a supplemental appropriation; or (2) request funds from a specified permanent judgment appropriation.</summary>
