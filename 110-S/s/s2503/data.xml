  <summary>12/18/2007--Introduced.
States that the Maritime Boundary Agreement Between the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba shall have no force and effect after the date of the enactment of this Act. Amends the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 to exclude from U.S. entry an alien who: (1) is an officer or principal of an entity, or a shareholder who owns a controlling interest in an entity that makes an investment of $1 million or more (or any combination of investments that equals or exceeds $1 million in any 12-month period) that significantly contributes to Cuba's ability to develop petroleum and natural gas resources off its north coast; or (2) is a spouse, minor child, or agent of such person. Exempts on a case-by-case basis entries for medical reasons or property-related litigation. Defines "investment" for purposes of this Act.</summary>
