States that failure by the Administrator to include this language shall not create a cause of action against the United States under the Clean Air Act or any other law or create a basis for overturning a settlement agreement entered into by the United States.Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include the District of Columbia as a state for purposes of grant programs for diesel emission reductions."
