Rural America Preservation Act of 2007 - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to reduce maximum annual direct and counter-cyclical commodity payments to $20,000 and $30,000, respectively. Revises limitation provisions for marketing loan gains, loan deficiency payments, and commodity certificate transactions, and establishes an annual combined limitation of $75,000 for such payments. Doubles payment limitations for single farming operations. Limits an individual to a combined annual payment of $250,000. Makes a person who commits fraud in connection with a scheme or device to evade certain program limitations (multiple entities, citizenship) ineligible for farm benefits for six years. Revises provisions respecting limitation of benefits to active farmers. Makes foreign entities ineligible for agricultural program benefits. Expresses the sense of the Senate that any savings achieved by this Act should be used to establish a permanent agricultural disaster relief program.</summary>
