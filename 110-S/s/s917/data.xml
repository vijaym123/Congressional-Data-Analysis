  <summary>3/19/2007--Introduced.
Declares that nothing in section 4 of the Act of March 2, 1929, (relating to prohibited acts of killing, wounding, or capturing wild birds and animals and fish in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado) or any other applicable law prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from using the services of qualified individuals, as volunteers or pursuant to a contract with the Secretary, to assist in carrying out the Elk and Vegetation Management Plan for the Park by using lethal means to reduce the population of elk within the Park. Instructs the Secretary to consult with the Colorado Division of Wildlife regarding potential participation by it in carrying out such Plan. Prohibits anything in this Act from applying to a taking of wildlife (within the meaning of "take" under the Endangered Species Act of 1973) within Rocky Mountain National Park for any purpose other than the implementation of the Elk and Vegetation Management Plan.</summary>
