  <summary>9/5/2007--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to take specified actions to allow the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to better serve persons with limited English proficiency by providing technical assistance to recipients of federal funds. Requires the Secretary to convene a task force to identify vital documents for translation to improve the access of such individuals to federally conducted and federally assisted programs and activities. Requires the Secretary to: (1) produce such translations and make them available on the HUD website; (2) develop and carry out a plan for providing HUD resources to assist federal funds recipients to improve the access of such individuals to programs and activities; and (3) develop a housing information resource center, with a 24-hour toll-free interpretation service telephone line, which may provide vital documents from competent translation services for housing services providers. Requires the center to: (1) operate a document clearinghouse; (2) evaluate best-practices models; and (3) provide information relating to culturally and linguistically competent housing services for populations with limited English proficiency.</summary>
