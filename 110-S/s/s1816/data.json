    "text": "National Women's Rights History Project Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the National Park Service (NPS), to designate a vehicular tour route, to be known as the Votes for Women History Trail Route, to link properties in the state of New York that are historically and thematically associated with the struggle for women's suffrage in the United States. Requires the National Park Service to administer the Trail through the Women's Rights National Historical Park (established under prior law). Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into cooperative agreements and memoranda of understanding with, and provide technical and financial assistance to, other federal agencies, the state, localities, regional governmental bodies, and private entities; (2) make annual grants to state historic preservation offices for not more than five years for assistance in surveying, evaluating, and nominating women's rights history properties to the National Register of Historic Places; and (3) make matching grants and give technical assistance for development of a network of governmental and nongovernmental entities providing interpretive and educational program development of national women's rights history, including historic preservation. Instructs the Secretary to ensure that National Register travel itinerary website entitled \"Places Where Women Made History,\" is updated to contain the results of the inventory of women's rights history properties conducted pursuant to this Act and any links to websites related to places on such inventory. Provides for the designation of a non-governmental managing network to manage the network developed under this Act and to work in partnership with the Director of the NPS and state historic preservation offices to coordinate operation of the network. Allows matching grants for historic preservation specific to the network to be available through state historic preservation offices. Authorizes appropriations."
