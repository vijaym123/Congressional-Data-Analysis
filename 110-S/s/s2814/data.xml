Limits the federal share of the cost of any activity to 75%.

Directs the Authority to develop an operation, maintenance, and replacement plan that establishes rates and fees necessary to ensure that the System is properly maintained and capable of delivering approximately 16,500 acre-feet of water per year. Prohibits the use of funds under this Act until such plan is developed and until the Secretary and the Authority have complied with applicable requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to: (1) enter into a cooperative agreement to provide financial and any other assistance requested by the Authority for planning, design, related preconstruction activities, and construction of the System, subject to specified requirements; and (2) consult with the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission and the Authority in preparing any required biological assessment under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Authorizes the Secretary, at the Authority's request, to provide technical assistance in planning, designing, constructing, and operating the System.(Sec. 6) Authorizes appropriations. Requires: (1) the amount made available to be adjusted to reflect changes in construction costs occurring after January 1, 2007, as indicated by engineering cost indices applicable to the types of construction necessary to carry out this Act; (2) amounts made available to the Authority in accordance with the cost-sharing requirement to be nonreimbursable and nonreturnable to the United States; and (3) any unexpended appropriated funds to be retained for use in future fiscal years consistent with this Act.</summary>
