Reduces credit amounts for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross incomes over $70,000 ($140,000 in the case of a joint return). Limits such credit to three eligible students per taxpayer in any taxable year and for four taxable years. Denies such credit to certain part-time students and students convicted of a felony drug offense. Repeals the tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses."
