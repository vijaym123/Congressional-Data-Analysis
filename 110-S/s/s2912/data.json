Exempts the killing or injuring of an exotic animal in a state or federal natural area reserve undertaking habitat restoration from such prohibition.Defines \"confined exotic animal\" as a mammal of a species not historically indigenous to the United States that has been held in captivity for the majority of its life or for a period of one year.Allows persons authorized by the Secretary of the Interior to make arrests, execute warrants, and search for and seize animals to enforce the provisions of this Act."
