    "text": "Small Business Contracting Revitalization Act of 2007 - Amends the Small Business Act to provide federal review and oversight of the practice of contract bundling (the consolidation of two or more procurement contracts into a solicitation for a single prime contract that is unlikely, because of its size or complexity, to be suitable for award to a small business). Revises or adds federal provisions or requirements concerning: (1) increased small business participation in federal procurement subcontracts, including a pilot program to provide contractual incentives to prime contractors that exceed their small business subcontracting goals; (2) Small Business Administration (SBA) certification of small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, women, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; (3) historically underutilized business zones (HUBZones) affected by military base closures; (4) the BusinessLINC program (business-to-business and mentor-protege relationships between large and small businesses); (5) information on contracts involving small businesses that were displaced by bundled or consolidated actions; (6) the reservation of certain prime contract awards to small businesses; (7) a Comptroller General study on federal procurement contracting reporting systems; (8) micropurchase guidelines; (9) reporting on overseas contracts; (10) federal agency accountability with respect to small business procurement contracting and subcontracting goals; (11) certification as a small business for purposes of eligibility for the award of federal contracts and subcontracts (including authority to protest a business as a small business for such purposes); (12) training for federal contracting and contract enforcement personnel; (13) revised size standards for qualification as a small business; and (14) small business size and status for purposes of multiple award contracts."
