Authorizes appropriations for voluntary contributions to the IAEA. Directs the National Academy of Sciences to report to Congress on a verification regime for a fissile material cutoff treaty. Directs the President to report to Congress respecting: (1) a plan to ensure the security of all nuclear weapons and weapons usable material at vulnerable sites worldwide and for working with other countries to ensure such materials' security; and (2) U.S. strategy and policies regarding the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. Authorizes appropriations to establish a national technical forensics program to develop technologies and procedures for determining the origin of nuclear materials, whether seized intact or collected after the detonation of a nuclear bomb. Establishes the Commission on United States Objectives and Strategy for Nuclear Nonproliferation and Peaceful Use of Nuclear Technology."
