Requires that 50% of such amounts go to the Secretary of the Interior for the costs of all environmental restoration, waste management, and environmental compliance regarding the remediation of the land transferred under certain existing provisions, including the former Anvil Points oil shale facility in Colorado. Requires that the remaining 50% go to Garfield, Rio Blanco, Moffat, and Mesa Counties, Colorado, to mitigate the effects of oil and gas development activities within the affected areas. Prohibits counting such funds in calculating payments for the counties under provisions relating to payment for entitlement land."
