Requires expansion of the vehicle, cargo, and pedestrian inspection lanes at Eagle Pass, Texas, and Laredo, Texas. Exempts the provisions of this Act from: (1) the Administrative Procedures Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act; and (2) federal competitive contracting and hiring requirements. Authorizes appropriations, including for continued implementation of: (1) the Secure Border Initiative, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, and the US-VISIT program; and (2) the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism."
