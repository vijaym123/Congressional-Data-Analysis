    "text": "Protecting Consumer Phone Records Act - Makes it unlawful to: (1) acquire or use customer proprietary network information without written consent; (2) represent that another person has consented in order to acquire such information; (3) obtain unauthorized access to certain systems or records in order to acquire such information; (4) sell or offer for sale such information; or (5) request that another person unlawfully obtain such information. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for a civil forfeiture penalty for violation of this Act. Imposes on IP-enabled voice service providers a duty to protect the confidentiality of specified proprietary information. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to require each telecommunications carrier to notify customers of unlawful disclosure of such information. Prohibits a commercial mobile services provider from providing any customer's wireless telephone number information to any wireless directory assistance service without express prior customer authorization. Requires de-listing on customer request without cost to the customer. Prohibits providers from publishing the information without such authorization. Prohibits fees for exercising these rights. Preempts any inconsistent state or local requirements. Requires that violations of certain provisions of this Act be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and treated as unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Gives the FCC concurrent enforcement jurisdiction. Provides for enforcement by states and preemption of state law. Requires public education about the protection afforded such information."
