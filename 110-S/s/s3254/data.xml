  <summary>7/11/2008--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a state-chartered banking entity to elect to be treated as a partnership or separate entity for tax purposes if it is organized as a limited liability company under state law and has Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance. Exempts such an entity from treatment as a bank under the Internal Revenue Code for purposes of its bad debts, losses, gains from the sale of its securities, and the taxation of its common trust funds.</summary>
