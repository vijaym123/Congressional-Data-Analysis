Requires each agency head and Inspector General (including the DOD Inspector General) to report to the Director on such violations semiannually.Requires each agency Inspector General to: (1) periodically conduct risk assessments of agency purchase and travel card programs and associated internal controls, analyze weaknesses and the frequency of improper activity, and develop a plan to determine the scope, frequency, and number of periodic audits of cardholders; (2) perform periodic audits of card transactions and report results to the agency head; and (3) report to the Director and the Comptroller General on the implementation of recommendations made to address audit findings.Requires the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations that include safeguards and internal controls to ensure that: (1) each cardholder is assigned an approving official; (2) DOD utilizes technologies to prevent or identify fraudulent purchases; (3) cards of terminated or transferred employees are invalidated; (4) steps are taken to recover the cost of improper or fraudulent purchases through salary offsets; and (5) DOD's Inspector General conducts periodic risk assessment of purchase card programs and associated internal controls, analyzes weaknesses and the frequency of improper activity, and develops appropriate corrective actions.
