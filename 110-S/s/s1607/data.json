(Sec. 4) Instructs the Secretary to: (1) analyze semiannually the prevailing real effective exchange rates of foreign currencies; (2) determine whether any such currency is in fundamental misalignment; and (3) designate it for priority action if the issuing country engages in specified behavior, including excessive and prolonged official or quasi-official accumulation of foreign assets for balance of payments purposes, and excessive reserve accumulation of foreign assets. (Sec. 5) Prescribes procedures for: (1) negotiations and consultations; and (2) actions in response to failure, including persistent failure, to adopt appropriate policies, or take identifiable action to eliminate the fundamental misalignment. (Sec. 8) Provides for a joint resolution of congressional disapproval of any determination by the President to waive an action, on the ground that it is in the vital U.S. economic interest to do so, with respect to a country which has persistently failed to adopt appropriate policies to eliminate a fundamental currency misalignment. (Sec. 9) Requires the United States to oppose any proposed change in the governance arrangement of an international financial institution if any of its members would benefit from the proposed change, in the form of increased voting shares or representation, despite having a currency designated for priority action under this Act. (Sec. 10) Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require an adjustment in the price used to establish export (and constructed export) prices, in the case of a fundamentally misaligned currency designated for priority action, by reducing such price by the percentage by which the domestic currency of the producer or exporter is undervalued in relation to the U.S. dollar. (Sec. 11) Adds as a factor the administering authority must take into account in determining whether a foreign country is a nonmarket economy country the question of whether its currency is designated for priority action under this Act. (Sec. 12) Applies to Canada and Mexico the requirements of this Act pertaining to: (1) adjustments in export prices for a fundamentally misaligned currency designated for priority action; and (2) determination of nonmarket economy status. (Sec. 13) Establishes the Advisory Committee on International Exchange Rate Policy.(Sec. 14) Repeals the Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988."
