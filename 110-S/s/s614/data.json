Reduces credit amounts for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross incomes over $70,000 ($140,000 in the case of a joint tax return). Allows an inflation adjustment to credit amounts beginning after 2008.Limits such credit to three eligible students per taxpayer in any taxable year and for four taxable years. Denies such credit for certain part-time students and for students convicted of a felony drug offense. Repeals the tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses."
