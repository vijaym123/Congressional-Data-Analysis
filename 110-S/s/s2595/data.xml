  <summary>2/6/2008--Introduced.
Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, or S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 - Encourages the states to establish a Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry for the residential mortgage industry through the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators. Sets forth procedures, requirements (including education and testing), and standards for mandatory registration and state licensing of mortgage loan originators. Requires the federal banking agencies jointly, through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, to develop and maintain a system for registering depository institiution employees as registered loan originators with the Registry. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish and maintain a backup licensing and registration system for loan originators operating in a state that either: (1) does not, after a certain period of time, have a licensing and registering system for loan originators that meets the requirements of this Act; or (2) does not participate in the Registry. Requires the HUD Secretary also to establish and maintain a backup licensing, supervisory, and tracking system for loan originators if the Registry is failing to meet the requirements and purposes of this Act. Declares that this Act does not preempt state law which provides greater protection to consumers than is provided under this Act. Directs the HUD Secretary to study and report to Congress on the root causes of default and foreclosure of home loans.</summary>
