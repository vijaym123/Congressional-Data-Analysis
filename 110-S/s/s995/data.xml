  <summary>3/27/2007--Introduced.
Amends the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to permit the designation of certain critical access hospitals in Cass County, Minnesota, and Kemper County, Mississippi, by exempting them from the requirement that they be certified by the state on or after January 1, 2006, as being a necessary provider of health care services to residents in the area. (Thus restores to Minnesota and Mississippi state authority to waive the application of the 35-mile rule.)</summary>
