  <summary>2/16/2007--Introduced.
Iraq Troop Protection and Reduction Act of 2007 - Prohibits, with a limited presidential national security waiver, U.S. military force levels in Iraq after the date of the enactment of this Act from exceeding such levels as of January 1, 2007. Prohibits appropriations for security and reconstruction assistance to the government of Iraq 90 days after enactment of this Act unless the President provides Congress with a specified certification respecting Iraq's: (1) security forces; (2) oil revenue distribution; (3) civil rights and political accommodation concerning its ethnic and sectarian groups; and (4) policy towards the participation of former Baath party members in the Iraqi government. Terminates authority for the use of U.S. military forces in Iraq 90 days after enactment of this Act unless the use of such forces is specifically authorized by Congress in a statute enacted after enactment of this Act or the President provides Congress with a specified certification respecting: (1) U.S. redeployment and mission transition; (2) Iraq's security forces; (3) oil revenue distribution; (4) civil rights and political accommodation concerning Iraq's ethnic and sectarian groups; (5) the participation of former Baath party members in the Iraqi government; and (6) the convening of an international conference on Iraq. States that the termination shall: (1) continue in effect if Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving the President's certification; and (2) not be construed to prohibit the use of U.S. military forces in Iraq for force protection, force security, or similar purposes during the U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq. Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds to deploy U.S. military forces to Iraq unless the Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that such forces are adequately equipped and trained for their missions.</summary>
