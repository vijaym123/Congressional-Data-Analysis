Directs the Secretary and such an entity to use the design work and environmental evaluations initiated by non-federal entities and the Corps of Engineers in that watershed to the maximum extent practicable. Requires such an agreement to specify the responsibilities of the Secretary and the entity regarding: (1) cost-share requirements; (2) needs assessment and project planning and design; (3) environmental compliance activity; (4) facilities construction; and (5) construction contract administration. Requires that any such project consist of two phases, during which the Secretary and an entity shall complete the planning, design, and construction of: (1) the main treatment and main conveyance system; and (2) the sub-regional distribution systems. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial and technical assistance to an entity in planning, designing, conducting related pre-construction activities for, and constructing a project. Makes the entity responsible for the annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs of the project. Requires the entity to develop an operation, maintenance, and replacement plan for the project."
