  <summary>2/7/2008--Introduced.
Trade Agreement Benchmarks and Accountability Act - Subjects bills implementing trade agreements to a point of order unless certain conditions are met.Withdraws congressional approval of a bill implementing a trade agreement only if a report by the International Trade Commission (ITC) indicates that certain benchmarks and predictions made with respect to an agreement are not being met and a joint resolution approving such withdrawal is enacted by Congress. Describes the benchmarks as analyses of the following effects of the agreement: (1) resulting job creation and job losses; (2) resulting improvement in wages for U.S. workers; (3) implementation and enforcement of the labor and environmental standards by each country that is a party to the agreement; and (4) the extent to which the agreement will result in an increase in access by U.S. businesses to the market of each country that is a party to the agreement, particularly those sectors identified by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) as of special importance.</summary>
