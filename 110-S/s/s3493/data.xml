  <summary>9/16/2008--Introduced.
Requires each rail carrier that is a Class I railroad, that has inadequate safety performance, or that provides intercity passenger or commuter rail passenger transportation to develop and submit for Secretary of Transportation approval by December 31, 2014,&#160;a plan to&#160;implement a positive train control system that prevents rail collisions. Requires implementation of&#160;such systems by&#160;December 31, 2012, in areas that have the highest safety risk due to shared track between commuter and freight rail. Prohibits installation of a positive train control system or component unless the Secretary has&#160;certified that it has not experienced a safety-critical failure during prior testing and evaluation. Increases penalties for violations of rail safety regulations or orders issued by the Secretary, including violations related to rail accident reporting and hours-of-service.</summary>
