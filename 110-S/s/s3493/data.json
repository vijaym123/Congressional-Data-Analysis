    "text": "Requires each rail carrier that is a Class I railroad, that has inadequate safety performance, or that provides intercity passenger or commuter rail passenger transportation to develop and submit for Secretary of Transportation approval by December 31, 2014,\u00a0a plan to\u00a0implement a positive train control system that prevents rail collisions. Requires implementation of\u00a0such systems by\u00a0December 31, 2012, in areas that have the highest safety risk due to shared track between commuter and freight rail. Prohibits installation of a positive train control system or component unless the Secretary has\u00a0certified that it has not experienced a safety-critical failure during prior testing and evaluation. Increases penalties for violations of rail safety regulations or orders issued by the Secretary, including violations related to rail accident reporting and hours-of-service."
