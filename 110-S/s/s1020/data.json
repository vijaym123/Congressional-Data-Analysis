Requires the CORE to: (1) promote renewable energy research and development in the areas of wind, wave, solar, geothermal, and biofuels production, particularly cellulosic; (2) consult with renewable energy experts regarding renewable energy policies and make policy recommendations to federal agencies; and (3) identify and recommend public and private research institutions to carry out renewable energy research."
