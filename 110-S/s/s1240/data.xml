Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act of 2007 - Prohibits any federal funds from being provided to a hospital under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act or to a state, with respect to hospital services, under title XIX (Medicaid) of such Act, unless the hospital meets certain conditions related to a woman who is a victim of sexual assault, including that the hospital: (1) provides the woman with accurate and unbiased information about emergency contraception; (2) offers emergency contraception to the woman; (3) provides the woman such contraception at the hospital on her request; (4) provides the woman with risk assessment, counseling, and treatment for certain sexually transmitted infections; and (5) does not deny any such services because of the inability of the woman or her family to pay.</summary>
