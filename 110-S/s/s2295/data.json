    "text": "Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2007 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) with respect to: (1) ballot verification and mandatory paper record audit capacity; and (2) accessibility and ballot verification of results for individuals with disabilities.Requires the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to study, test, and develop best practices to enhance the accessibility of ballot verification mechanisms for individuals with disabilities, voters whose primary language is not English, and voters with difficulties in literacy.Requires laboratories to meet standards prohibiting conflicts of interest as a condition of accreditation for the testing of voting system hardware and software.Outlines additional voting system requirements and prohibitions.Provides for grants for research on development of election-dedicated voting system software. Provides for complaints to the Attorney General by persons aggrieved by violations of HAVA. Directs each state to administer, without advance notice to the precincts selected, audits of the results of elections for federal office held in the state consisting of random hand counts of the voter-verified paper paper ballots required to be produced and preserved for each such election held in the state. Requires the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to make payments to states to cover the costs incurred in carrying out such mandatory manual audits. Repeals the exemption of the EAC from certain government contracting requirements."
