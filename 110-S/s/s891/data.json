    "text": "Child Medication Safety Act of 2007 - Requires states, as a condition of receiving funds under any program or activity administered by the Secretary of Education, to develop and implement policies and procedures prohibiting school personnel from requiring a child, as a condition of attending school or receiving services, to obtain a prescription for any specified controlled substances listed under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) or a psychotropic drug. Prohibits the provision of federal education funds to any local educational agency or instrument of government that uses a parent's or guardian's refusal to provide his or her child with a controlled substance or psychotropic drug as the basis of a child abuse, child neglect, education neglect, or medical neglect charge. Directs the Comptroller General to review and report on: (1) variation among state definitions of psychotropic medications in state jurisdiction over public education; (2) prescription rates of medications used in public schools to treat children diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other disorders or illnesses; and (3) which of such medications are CSA-listed and which are not, including properties and effects of the latter."
