    "text": "Voting Opportunities and Integrity in the Conduct of Elections Act of 2008 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to: (1) allow individuals to vote in an election before the date of the regularly scheduled election; (2) require the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to issue standards for administration of such voting; and (3) require each state to permit any person otherwise qualified to vote in a federal election to vote in a manner other than in person, and impose no conditions or restrictions on absentee voting other than a reasonable deadline for requesting and returning the ballot.Directs the EAC to establish a Vote by Mail grant program. Requires each federal election voting system to require the use of or produce an individual, durable, voter-verified, paper ballot of the voter's vote, available for voter inspection and verification before the vote is cast and counted. Directs the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to study, test, and develop best practices to enhance the accessibility of ballot verification mechanisms for individuals with disabilities, for voters whose primary language is not English, and for voters with difficulties in literacy.Prohibits the use of: (1) uncertified election dedicated voting system technologies; and (2) any voting system unless its manufacturer and the election officials using it meet applicable security requirements. Provides for mandatory availability of paper ballots at polling places.Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to make research grants for development of election-dedicated voting system software. Requires states to make unannounced random hand counts of the voter-verified paper ballots in a federal election.Directs the EAC to establish: (1) a pre-registration implementation grant program; (2) an automatic re-registration grant program; and (3) a computerized system capable of communicating and exchanging data among participating states (interoperability).Prohibits voter caging practices (those preventing voting or registration through the reliance by officials on certain non-forwardable or non-returned documents)."
