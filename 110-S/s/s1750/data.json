Removes prompt pay discounts from the calculation of such price.Provides for an increase in the Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) payment for chemotherapy administration services.Directs the Secretary to make an additional 2% for any drug administration services payment to physicians, taking into account pharmacy facilities management costs.Directs the Secretary to develop new CPT codes for reporting and billing of physician's services associated with pharmacy facilities management and with medical oncology treatment planning."
