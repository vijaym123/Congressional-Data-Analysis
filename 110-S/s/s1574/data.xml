  <summary>6/7/2007--Introduced.
Teaching Residency Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to make competitive matching grants to partnerships of high-need local educational agencies (LEAs), nonprofit community agencies, and institutions of higher education to support one-year teaching residency programs under which recent college graduates or professionals outside the field of education engage in rigorous master's level coursework while undertaking a guided teaching apprenticeship alongside a trained and experienced mentor teacher. Requires program participants to earn a master's degree and attain full state teaching certification or licensure prior to completing the program and accept placement for three years thereafter in a high-need school served by the high-need LEA.</summary>
