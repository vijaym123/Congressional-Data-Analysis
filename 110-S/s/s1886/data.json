Amends the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to deem whether a state has taken efforts to provide its citizens with greater access to affordable private health insurance, including by establishing a state health insurance exchange, a high risk pool, a reinsurance mechanism, or other high risk solution. Sets forth requirements for certification of a state health insurance exchange.Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to expand Medicaid health opportunity accounts to all states as of January 1, 2008."
