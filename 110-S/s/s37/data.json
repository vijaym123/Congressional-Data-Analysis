    "text": "Nuclear Waste Access to Yucca Act - Withdraws specified lands in Nye County, Nevada, permanently from any form of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws, including: (1) the mineral leasing laws; (2) the geothermal leasing laws; (3) materials sales laws; and (4) the mining laws. Transfers jurisdiction over such lands to the Secretary of Energy. Reserves use of such lands for certain activities associated with the disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Requires the Secretary to manage the lands so withdrawn, and submit to Congress and the state of Nevada a management plan for their use. Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to direct the Secretary to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a license to construct and operate facilities to receive and store spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at the Yucca Mountain site. Authorizes the Secretary to begin construction of connected infrastructure facilities after completion of a final environmental impact statement evaluating the activities involved. Requires the Secretary to acquire rights-of-way for construction and operation of railroad facilities to transport spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from existing rail systems to the site of surface facilities within the geologic repository operations area for the receipt, handling, packaging, and storage of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste prior to emplacement. Revises requirements for new plant contracts."
