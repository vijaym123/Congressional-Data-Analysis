Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) to carry out such assistance program. Directs the Secretary of each military department, and the Secretary of Homeland Security when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, to provide notice to individuals who meet program eligibility requirements. Revises educational assistance allowance rates based on periods of active duty service. Provides a ten-year limit after separation for the use of such assistance for a member of the Selected Reserve who completes a required period of service under other than dishonorable conditions. Requires the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the Secretary, by the beginning of FY2010, amounts provided or remaining in the Department of Defense Education Benefits Fund that are attributable to the reserve educational assistance program."
