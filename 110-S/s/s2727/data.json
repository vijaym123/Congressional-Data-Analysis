Directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to study and report on: (1) the resource effectiveness and quality of hospice care as a substitute benefit for other acute care alternatives under Medicare; (2) the optimal median and average length of stay in hospice care under Medicare; (3) the reasons for persistently low median and average length of such stays; and (4) the desirability of requiring a national coverage determination of eligibility for hospice care under Medicare."
