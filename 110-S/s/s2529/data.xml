Requires a manufacturer or retailer that sells or markets a product with the intention of remitting a portion of the proceeds to a charitable organization to disclose to the purchaser the portion of the purchase price that will be remitted, the maximum amount that will be remitted, the applicable time period, and the organization's contact information.</summary>
