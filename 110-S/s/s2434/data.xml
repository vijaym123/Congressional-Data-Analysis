  <summary>12/7/2007--Introduced.
Computer Trespass Clarification Act of 2007 - Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) exclude from the definition of "computer trespasser" for purposes of determining the legality of interceptions of computer communications any person who has any relationship with the owner or operator of a protected computer (currently, only persons who have a contractual relationship with the owner or operator of a protected computer are excluded); (2) require the owner or operator of a protected computer to be attempting to respond to communications activity that threatens the integrity or operation of such computer before authorizing the interception of a computer trespasser's communications by a person acting under color of law (e.g., law enforcement officers); and (3) limit the length of warrantless surveillance of a computer trespasser to the earlier of 96 hours or as soon as communications that are sought are obtained.</summary>
