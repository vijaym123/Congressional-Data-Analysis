Small Business Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 - Sets a deadline for final rules establishing a small business education and assistance program regarding energy efficiency. Creates in the Small Business Administration (SBA) the position of Assistant Administrator for Small Business Energy Policy. Establishes a Small Business Energy Efficiency Pilot Program to provide energy efficiency assistance to small businesses through small business development centers. Makes centers selected for the program eligible for grants. Creates a pilot program to provide information regarding telecommuting to small businesses and to encourage the businesses to offer telecommuting options to employees, including outreach regarding individuals with disabilities.
