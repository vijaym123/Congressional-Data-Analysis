  <summary>11/2/2007--Reported to Senate without amendment.
Same Number Act of 2007 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to declare that a provider of voice services (a telecommunications service or an IP-enabled voice service) has the duty to provide number portability to the extent technically feasible. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish number portability performance standards for such providers. Requires the FCC to designate one or more impartial entities to administer telecommunications and voice service numbering and to ensure that numbers are available on an equitable basis. Gives the FCC exclusive jurisdiction of those portions of the North American Numbering Plan that pertain to the United States. Requires that the costs of establishing numbering administration arrangements and number portability be borne by all voice service providers on a competitively neutral basis. Requires designation of 9-1-1 as the universal emergency telephone number within the United States for both wireline and wireless telephone service.</summary>
