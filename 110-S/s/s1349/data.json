Directs the Secretaries to establish protocols to ensure that members receive continuity of care and assistance during and after the transition from military service to civilian life. Requires the Secretary of Defense to: (1) review certain previous decisions of discharge from the Armed Forces under other than honorable conditions to determine whether a TBI was a cause of action that precipitated the discharge and, if so, reconsider and redesignate the discharge; and (2) conduct specified TBI research."
