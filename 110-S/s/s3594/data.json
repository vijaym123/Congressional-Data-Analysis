Sets forth protections for specified vulnerable populations. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) ensure that U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and other individuals are not unlawfully detained by establishing secure alternative custody programs; and (2) establish a detention advisory committee. Establishes within DHS a position of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ombudsman."
