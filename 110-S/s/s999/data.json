Authorizes the Secretary to award matching grants to states or consortia of states to develop and implement stroke care systems that provide high-quality prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. Sets forth requirements for each state or consortium, including to: (1) establish, enhance, or expand a statewide stroke care system to promote the total quality improvement of stroke care consistent with evidence-based practices; (2) establish, enhance, or expand stroke care centers; (3) enhance, develop, and implement effective methods for training emergency medical services personnel in the identification, assessment, stabilization, and prehospital treatment of stroke patients; and (4) establish, enhance, or improve a support network to provide assistance to facilities with smaller populations of stroke patients or less advanced on-site stroke treatment resources. Allows each state or consortium to use grant funds to: (1) improve existing stroke prevention programs; (2) conduct a stroke education and information campaign; (3) make grants to public and nonprofit private entities for medical professional development; and (4) develop and implement education programs for appropriate medical personnel and health professionals in the use of evidence-based diagnostic approaches, technologies, and therapies for the prevention and treatment of stroke.Prohibits the Secretary from making payments to a state or consortium unless the state or consortium agrees that the payments will not be expended: (1) to make cash payments to intended recipients of services; (2) to satisfy any federal matching requirements; (3) to provide financial assistance to any entity other than a public or nonprofit private entity; or (4) for construction, alteration, or improvement of any building or facility.Authorizes the Secretary to give special consideration in awarding grants to any state or consortium: (1) in geographic areas in which there is an elevated incidence or prevalence of stroke or disability resulting from stroke or in an area that is underserved by medical specialists; (2) that demonstrates a significant need for assistance in establishing a comprehensive stroke care system; or (3) that will enhance regional cooperation.Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2012."
