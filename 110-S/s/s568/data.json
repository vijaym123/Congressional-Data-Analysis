    "text": "Truth in Video Game Rating Act - Prohibits any rating organization from assigning a content rating to any video or computer game unless it has reviewed its entire playable content. Prohibits any producer, seller, or distributor of such games from withholding or hiding any such content from a rating organization. Requires any person submitting to a rating organization a video or computer game with hidden content to accompany it with the codes or methods necessary to access such hidden content. Prohibits a rating organization from providing a content rating that grossly mischaracterizes the game content. Makes a violation of a prohibition of this Act an unfair or deceptive act or practice under specified provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act and requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce this Act."
