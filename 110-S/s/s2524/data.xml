  <summary>12/19/2007--Introduced.
Davis-Bacon Enforcement Act of 2007 - Amends the Davis-Bacon Act to require that any provisions of federal law that require payment of prevailing wages be construed to include the Act's debarment requirements (prohibiting for three years any award of federal contracts to persons or related firms, corporations, partnerships, or associations listed by the Comptroller General as having disregarded their obligations to employees and subcontractors under the Act). Requires each federal agency to make available to the public the complete payroll records (including all information in them except Social Security numbers) established under contracts subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.</summary>
