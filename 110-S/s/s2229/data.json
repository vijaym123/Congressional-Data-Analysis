    "text": "Wyoming Range Legacy Act of 2008 - (Sec. 3) Withdraws specified National Forest System land and federally owned minerals located within the boundaries of the Bridger-Teton National Forest (the Wyoming Range withdrawal area) from: (1) all forms of appropriation or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) disposition under laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing. Requires that if any such right is relinquished or otherwise acquired by the United States (including through donation under this Act), the land subject to that right shall be withdrawn. Prohibits anything in this section from requiring: (1) the creation of a protective perimeter or buffer area outside the boundaries of the Wyoming Range withdrawal area; or (2) any prohibition on activities outside the boundaries of the withdrawal area that can be seen or heard from within the boundaries. Makes the Bridger-Teton National Land and Resource Management Plan, including any revisions, applicable to any land within the Wyoming Range withdrawal area. Provides that, if there is a conflict between this Act and the Management Plan, this Act shall apply. Bars anything in this section from prohibiting the Secretary of the Interior from taking any action necessary to issue, deny, remove the suspension of, or cancel a lease, or any sold lease parcel that has not been issued, pursuant to any lease sale conducted prior to enactment of this Act, including the completion of any requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Authorizes the Secretary to lease oil and gas resources in the Wyoming Range withdrawal area which are within one mile of the boundary of the area in accordance with the Mineral Leasing Act and subject to conditions that: (1) the lease may only be accessed by directional drilling from a lease held by production on National Forest System land that is adjacent to, and outside of, the Wyoming Range withdrawal area; (2) the lease shall prohibit, without exception or waiver, surface occupancy and surface disturbance for any activities, including activities related to exploration, development, or production; and (3) the directional drilling may extend no further than one mile inside the boundary of the Wyoming Range withdrawal area. (Sec. 4) Sets forth provisions for the retirement and repurchase of valid existing mining or leasing rights within the Wyoming Range withdrawal area. Requires the Secretary to prepare a list of interested holders of such a mining or leasing right and to make the list available to any non-federal entity or person interested in acquiring that right. Prohibits the Secretary from using any federal funds to purchase any such valid existing mining or leasing right."
