Sets forth minimum requirements for such standards concerning: (1) influenza exposure; (2) personal protective equipment; (3) training and information; (4) medical surveillance for exposed workers; and (5) immunization against the pandemic influenza virus, if such a vaccine has been approved and is available.Requires the HHS Secretary to revise the provisions of the HHS pandemic influenza plan to conform with the minimum worker protection requirements described in this Act and with the permanent occupational safety and health exposure standard issued by the Secretary of Labor under this Act."
