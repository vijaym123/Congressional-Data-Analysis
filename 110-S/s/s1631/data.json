Authorizes the President to declare a federal energy emergency if the health, safety, welfare, or economic well-being of U.S. citizens is at risk because of an imminent or actual shortage of adequate supplies of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates owing to: (1) a disruption in the national distribution system for such distillates (including a shortage related to a major disaster); or (2) significant pricing anomalies in national energy markets for them. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to award grants to states under a presidential declaration of fuel supply interruption."
