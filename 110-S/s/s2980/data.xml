Starting Early Starting Right Act - Amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to establish, within the Administration for Children and Families, an Office of Child Care to serve as the principal advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families on issues regarding state-funded child care programs. Requires the state plan under the Act to certify that the state has in effect: (1) licensing requirements applicable to child care providers within the state that include one annual announced and one annual unannounced visit to each site at which the provider provides child care services; and (2) licensing or registration requirements pertaining to training. Requires the state plan to: (1) demonstrate the manner in which the state will meet the specific child care needs of low-income and working families and how the state is implementing practices and procedures to help ensure that children receive continuous care from the same provider; (2) provide information demonstrating that the state is ensuring that payment rates for the provision of child care services for which assistance is provided are equal to or exceed the 75th percentile of the current market rate for all types of child care; and (3) describe efforts to address the need for child care for special populations. Increases from 4% to 15% the maximum amount of child care and development block grant funds that a state may use for specified activities designed to improve the quality of child care. Provides for minimum funding set-asides for: (1) extension of full-day care; and (2) high-quality care for infants and toddlers. Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act to provide for increased appropriations for child care assistance grants under the TANF program for FY2009-FY2014.</summary>
