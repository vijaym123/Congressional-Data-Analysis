  <summary>2/26/2007--Introduced.
Elk Population Management Act of 2007 - Declares that nothing in section 4 of the Act of March 2, 1929, (relating to prohibited acts of killing, wounding, or capturing wild birds and animals and fish in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado) or any other provision of law, prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from permitting an authorized individual to use lethal means to reduce the population of elk located within Theodore Roosevelt National Park, in accordance with the elk management plan for such Park (as defined in this Act). Instructs the Secretary to consult with the appropriate agency of the State of North Dakota to determine the level of participation of such agency in carrying out this Act. Prohibits the Secretary from permitting an individual to take any elk located within Theodore Roosevelt National Park for any purpose other than to carry out the elk management plan.</summary>
