Instructs the Secretary to consult with the appropriate agency of the State of North Dakota to determine the level of participation of such agency in carrying out this Act. Prohibits the Secretary from permitting an individual to take any elk located within Theodore Roosevelt National Park for any purpose other than to carry out the elk management plan."
