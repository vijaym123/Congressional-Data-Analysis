  <summary>3/22/2007--Introduced.
Department of Energy Carbon Capture and Storage Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2007 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to direct the Secretary of Energy to: (1) carry out fundamental science and engineering research to develop and document new approaches to capture and store carbon dioxide; (2) ensure that fundamental research is appropriately applied to energy technology development activities and the field testing of carbon sequestration activities; (3) promote regional carbon sequestration partnerships to conduct geologic sequestration tests involving carbon dioxide in a variety of geological settings; and (4) conduct at least seven initial large-volume sequestration tests for geological containment of carbon dioxide. Directs the Secretary, in making competitive awards, to give preference to proposals from partnerships among industrial, academic, and government entities.</summary>
