Provides that, the Secretary of the Interior, upon the conveyance of the public land, shall have discretion as to whether or not the reversionary interests of the United States are to be exercised with respect to that land. Subjects the private land, upon conveyance to the Boy Scouts, to the terms and conditions imposed on the entire tract of land acquired by the Boy Scouts for a camp. Instructs the Secretary, upon the completion of the land exchange under this Act, to amend the original Bureau of Land Management (BLM) patent providing for the conveyance to the Boy Scouts of the entire tract of land under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, numbered 43-75-0010, to take into account the exchange under this Act."
