Permits a federal law enforcement officer to investigate an alleged violation regardless of whether such officer receives a referral from the Board. Requires that the findings of an investigation of such an alleged violation by any federal department or agency be submitted to a federal or state prosecuting authority or the Board. Authorizes the Board, upon receiving the findings of such an investigation, to: (1) recommend to the Attorney General that criminal proceedings be initiated (current law); and (2) provide such support to the Attorney General relating to the criminal proceedings as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate. Allows the Board, in lieu of or in addition to any such criminal proceeding, to recommend that the Attorney General initiate a civil action. Revises the definitions and requirements relating to civil actions for mispresentation of Indian produced goods and products.Amends the federal criminal code to base criminal penalties for misrepresentation of Indian produced goods and products upon the value of such goods and products."
