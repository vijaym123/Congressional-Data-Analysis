Revises such exemption to specify, in addition to these criteria, that during the preceding 12-month period the investment adviser: (1) had assets under management of not more than $50 million; and (2) did not manage the assets of more than 15 investors, whether individually, in a pooled investment vehicle, or otherwise."
