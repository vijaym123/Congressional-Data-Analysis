Excludes the national service educational award from an individual's gross income for tax purposes. Permits the Corporation for National and Community Service to support a national service program that is carried out by another federal agency and implements the priorities of such agency. Makes Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation a Cabinet position. Raises the Officer's compensation to Level I of the Executive Schedule."
