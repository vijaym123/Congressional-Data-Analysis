Idling Reduction Tax Credit Act of 2007 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business tax credit for 25% of the cost of a qualifying idling reduction device, up to $1,000. Defines "qualifying idling reduction device" as any device that is: (1) installed on a heavy-duty diesel-powered on-highway vehicle to provide services that would otherwise require the operation of the main drive engine while the vehicle is temporarily parked or stationary; and (2) certified by the Secretary of Energy to reduce long-duration idling. Directs the Secretary to publish standards for certifying such devices.</summary>
