Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to 20 years for violations. Revises criminal prohibitions against: (1) making false statements in an application for a passport; (2) forgery and unlawful production of a passport; (3) misuse of a passport; and (4) immigration and visa fraud, including trafficking in counterfeit immigration documents. Makes the punishment for attempts or conspiracies to commit passport or visa fraud the same as for the completed crime. Prohibits in connection with federal immigration laws: (1) any scheme to defraud persons seeking benefits under such laws; and (2) false representation of attorney (or accredited representative) status. Grants extraterritorial jurisdiction for the prosecution of certain passport and visa fraud offenses. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to revise its sentencing guidelines and policies relating to passport and visa fraud offenses. Directs the Attorney General to develop prosecution guidelines for compliance with U.S. treaty obligations relating to asylum seekers entering the United States with fraudulent documents. Expands the investigative authority of State Department special agents relating to passport and document fraud."
