Establishes a procedure for accelerated approval of an investigational drug, biological product, or device that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to a patient suffering from a serious or life-threatening condition.Requires the Secretary to establish: (1) the Accelerated Approval Advisory Committee; (2) a new program to expand access to investigational treatments for individuals with serious or life threatening conditions and diseases; and (3) a demonstration project under the Medicare program to pay for drugs, biological, products, and devices approved under this Act.Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to revise the definition of \"medically accepted indication\" to provide for coverage of a covered Part D drug based on the sponsor's or organization's determination that the drug is for a medically accepted indication.Requires the Secretary to consider the clinical judgment and risks to the patient from the disease or condition in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of drugs, biological products, and devices that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, including the evaluation of nonstatistical information.Requires any committee evaluating investigational drugs, devices, or biological product applications to have at least two patient representatives as voting members."
