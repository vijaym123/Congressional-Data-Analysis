    "text": "Furthering the Independence of Federal Prosecutors Act of 2007 - Amends the federal criminal code to impose a fine and/or prison term of up to one year for intentionally coercing, pressuring, or attempting to influence the decision of a U.S. attorney to conduct a criminal investigation or pursue a prosecution of any person based upon that person's race, sex, national origin, political activities, or political beliefs. Requires the appointment of a special prosecutor for enforcement of this Act. Prohibits a federal government attorney, in determining whether to prosecute or take other action against an individual in a criminal matter, from considering: (1) the race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities or beliefs of such individual; (2) the personal feelings of such attorney concerning such individual, the associates of such individual, or the victim; or (3) the possible effect of a decision on the professional or personal circumstances of such attorney."
