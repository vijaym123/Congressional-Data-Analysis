    "text": "Effective Immigration Enforcement Partnerships Act of 2008 - States that state and local law enforcement personnel are fully authorized in the normal course of their duties to investigate, apprehend, or transfer to federal custody aliens in the United States (including interstate transportation of such aliens to detention centers) in order to assist in the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. Provides for the listing of immigration violators in the National Crime Information Center database. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect to illegal aliens apprehended by state or local authorities to provide for: (1) federal custody upon state or local enforcement entity request; and (2) state or local compensation for related incarceration and transportation costs. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish immigration-related training for state and local personnel. Provides: (1) personal liability immunity to the same extent as corresponding federal immunity for state or local personnel enforcing immigration laws within the scope of their duties; and (2) civil rights money damage immunity for state or local agencies enforcing immigration laws unless their personnel violated criminal law in such enforcement. Authorizes a state or locality to: (1) detain an illegal alien after completion of such alien's state prison sentence for up to 14 days to facilitate federal transfer; and (2) issue a detainer that would allow the detention of aliens who have served such a sentence until taken into federal custody. States that nothing in this Act may be construed to require state or local law enforcement personnel to: (1) report the identity of a victim of, or a witness to, a criminal offense for immigration enforcement purposes; (2) arrest such victim or witness for an immigration violation; or (3) enforce U.S. immigration laws."
