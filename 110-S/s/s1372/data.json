    "text": "Nanotechnology Infrastructure Enhancement Act - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a geographically diverse, interdisciplinary Center for Nanotechnology Research and Engineering (the Center) to focus on: (1) the science and engineering of manufacturing at the nanoscale in multiple dimensions; or (2) nanotechnology for sustainable energy, water, agriculture, and the environment. Allows the Center to be a Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center or a National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network node. Requires that the Center shall consist of: (1) a lead academic institution located in an EPSCoR (the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) state; and (2) at least one additional academic institution located in a second EPSCoR state. Permits the Center to include other institutions within or outside of the United States. Requires the Center to: (1) conduct state-of-the-art research on nanomanufacturing; (2) collaborate with other NSF grantees, and with grantees from other federal agencies, working on nanomanufacturing; (3) share resources with the programs of such grantees for the purpose of mutual advantage; and (4) work toward a nanomanufacturing network that encourages extensive industrial collaboration."
