Healing Our Nation's Heroes Act of 2008 - Establishes a commission on veterans and members of the Armed Forces (members) with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or other mental health disorders caused by military service. Requires the commission to: (1) oversee the monitoring and treatment of veterans and members with such disorders; and (2) conduct a study of the long-term adverse consequences of such disorders for such veterans and members. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) to carry out a program, to be known as the Heroes-to-Healers Program, to assist veterans and members separating from service to: (1) obtain certification as mental health care providers; and (2) find employment with federal, state, and local agencies and nongovernmental organizations that provide mental health care to members, veterans, and their families. Requires participants, following certification, to work for at least five years in such mental health care capacity, but authorizes the Secretary to waive such requirement when considered appropriate. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to pay a bonus of up to $10,000 to a Program participant who agrees to such service. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to establish a program to award grants to encourage state and local mental health agencies and other entities to establish, expand, or enhance mental health provider recruitment and retention efforts. Requires participants who receive training through the program to serve at a high-need medical facility or agency for at least three years.</summary>
