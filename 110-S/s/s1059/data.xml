  <summary>3/29/2007--Introduced.
Zero-Emissions Building Act of 2007 - Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to instruct the Secretary of Energy to establish revised federal building energy efficiency performance standards that require new federal buildings, if life-cycle cost-effective, be designed so that the greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, as compared to the fossil fuel-generated energy consumption by a similar federal building during FY2003, by specified increasing percentages between FY2007 and FY2030. Prescribes alternative compliance guidelines.</summary>
