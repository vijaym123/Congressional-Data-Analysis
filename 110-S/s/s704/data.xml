  <summary>12/5/2007--Reported to Senate amended.
Truth in Caller ID Act of 2007 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make it unlawful for any person in the United States, in connection with any telecommunications service or Internet protocol (IP)-enabled voice service, to cause any caller identification (ID) service to knowingly transmit misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value, unless such transmission is exempted in connection with: (1) authorized activities of law enforcement agencies; or (2) a court order specifically authorizing the use of caller ID manipulation. Prohibits construing these provisions to authorize or prohibit any investigative, protective, or intelligence activities performed in connection with official duties and in accordance with all applicable laws, by a law enforcement agency of the United States, a state or its political subdivision, or a U.S. intelligence agency. Provides civil and criminal penalties for violations. Allows enforcement by states, granting the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the right to intervene.</summary>
