  <summary>10/4/2007--Reported to Senate without amendment.
Fair Contracts for Growers Act of 2007 - Amends federal law provisions concerning arbitration to define "livestock," "livestock or poultry contract," "livestock or poultry grower," and "poultry." Allows the use of arbitration to resolve a controversy as provided for under a livestock or poultry contract only if, after the controversy arises, both parties consent in writing to use arbitration. Directs the arbitrator to provide to the parties to the contract a written explanation of the factual and legal basis for an award.</summary>
