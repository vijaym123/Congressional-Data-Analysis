    "text": "Mohawk River Hydroelectric Projects Licensing Act of 2007 - Prohibits the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from issuing a new license for a hydroelectric project on the Mohawk River in New York if the project has been operating under annual licenses for 10 or more years, unless FERC: (1) issues a public notice that it will accept other valid license applications to develop or dispose of the project works or water resource (including certain nonpower license applications); and (2) approves a license application, according to the requirements of this Act, if other valid license applications are submitted, or if FERC has issued a new license that is not yet final. Sets forth processing and approval procedures. Requires any new power license issued for such project to include the same license conditions relating to the use of affected waters as provided in the license for a specified Potomac Light & Power Company Project. Declares this Act applicable to specified hydroelectric projects for which: (1) a new license has been issued at the time of this Act but which has not yet become final under law; (2) there are pending judicial appeals; (3) the time has not yet lapsed for filing such appeals; or (4) there is a pending appeal of the Clean Water Act section 401 Water Quality Certificate."
