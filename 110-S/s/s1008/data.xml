  <summary>3/28/2007--Introduced.
Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to: (1) develop an independent safety assessment procedure for nuclear facilities; and (2) create a team to inspect the design, construction, maintenance, and operational safety performance of a facility. Declares that a final NRC decision on whether to extend an operating license, approve an extended power uprate, or continue to operate a facility shall not be made until: (1) the NRC has completed the independent safety assessment of the facility; and (2) the licensee has fully accepted and implemented each NRC-approved finding and recommendation of the assessment report.</summary>
