Directs the Secretary of Energy and the Economic Development Administration to give priority to projects supportting commercial-scale cellulosic biomass ethanol projects and coal-to-liquids facilities. Directs the Secretary to make an additional award in connection with a grant made to a recipient (including any Indian tribe for use on Indian land) for a project to support a commercial-scale biomass ethanol facility or coal-to-liquid facility.Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to appoint a task force to report to Congress on: (1) modernization of the hydrocarbon reserves disclosures classification system of the SEC to reflect advances in reserves recovery from nontraditional sources; and (2) creation of a renewable reserves classification system for cellulosic biofuels feedstocks."
