Requires the Secretary to: (1) notify such committees if the Secretary determines that the current estimate of implementation costs for an individual major base closure or realignment is at least 25% greater than the baseline estimate for such closure or realignment; and (2) develop a business plan to reduce the costs of any individual substantially over-budget major base closure or realignment to a level less than 25% greater than its baseline estimate. Directs the: (1) Secretary to submit to the President a recommendation regarding whether to continue implementation of a substantially over-budget major base closure or realignment; and (2) President to report to Congress regarding the implementation of such a closure or realignment. Prohibits the Secretary from continuing or discontinuing the implementation of a substantially over-budget major closure or realignment recommended by the President if a joint resolution disapproving the President's recommendation is enacted."
