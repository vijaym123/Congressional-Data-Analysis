Sets forth requirements regarding: (1) preventing explosive devices on passenger planes; (2) deployment of explosive detection systems at airports; (3) not applying certain TSA personnel limitations; (4) specialized training for TSA officers; (5) an appeal process for passengers wrongly delayed or prohibited from boarding a flight; (6) a strategic plan to test and implement an advanced passenger prescreening system; and (7) certification of foreign repair stations. Directs the Administrator to: (1) develop and implement a standardized airport threat and vulnerability assessment program; (2) based on a study, provide grants to airport operators for security upgrade projects; (3) develop a system under which foreign registered aircraft submit specified information to TSA; and (4) report on security credentials of airline crews."
