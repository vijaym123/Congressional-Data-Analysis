Directs the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA Administrator) to: (1) evaluate the blast-resistant cargo container pilot program and then begin acquisition of containers to meet TSA cargo security program requirements; and (2) develop a system to make such containers available for use by domestic and foreign passenger airlines. Sets forth requirements regarding: (1) preventing explosive devices on passenger planes; (2) deployment of explosive detection systems at airports; (3) not applying certain TSA personnel limitations; (4) specialized training for TSA officers; (5) an appeal process for passengers wrongly delayed or prohibited from boarding a flight; (6) a strategic plan to test and implement an advanced passenger prescreening system; and (7) certification of foreign repair stations. Directs the Administrator to: (1) develop and implement a standardized airport threat and vulnerability assessment program; (2) based on a study, provide grants to airport operators for security upgrade projects; (3) develop a system under which foreign registered aircraft submit specified information to TSA; and (4) report on security credentials of airline crews.</summary>
