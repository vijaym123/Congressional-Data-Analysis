Requires any VA facility designated as a voter registration agency to: (1) provide information relating to the opportunity to request an absentee ballot; (2) make available absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots upon request, as well as assistance in completing them; and (3) work with local election officials to ensure the proper delivery of such applications and ballots. Directs the Secretary to permit a meaningful opportunity for nonpartisan organizations to provide voter registration information and assistance at VA facilities. Prohibits the Secretary from banning any election administration official, whether state or local, party-affiliated or non-party affiliated, or elected or appointed, from providing nonpartisan voting information to veterans at any VA facility. Directs the Secretary to provide reasonable access to VA facilities to state and local election officials for the purpose of providing nonpartisan voter registration services to individuals."
