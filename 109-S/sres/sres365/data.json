Amends rule XVI (Committee Procedure) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to make it out of order to consider any bill or amendment between the chambers or conference report on such a measure unless a list is made available to all Members and the general public for at least 24 hours before its consideration of all earmarks in it, the identity of the Member who proposed each earmark, and an explanation of the essential governmental purpose for it. Requires any Member who requests an earmark in the bill, before its consideration in the Senate, to file a copy of the request with the Secretary of the Senate. Requires the request to be printed in the Congressional Record. Amends rule XXVIII (Conference Committees, Reports, Open Meetings) to make it out of order to consider a conference report if it is not available to all Members and made available to the general public on the Internet for at least 24 hours before its consideration."
