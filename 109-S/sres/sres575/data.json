    "text": "Recognizes Nigeria's importance as a strategic partner and long-time friend of the United States. Acknowledges Nigeria's rising prominence as a regional leader and role model. Commends the National Assembly of Nigeria's decision to reject a constitutional amendment that would have allowed for a third presidential term. Encourages the government of Nigeria and the Independent National Electoral Commission to demonstrate a commitment to democratic elections by: (1) developing a voter registration and education plan; (2) addressing corruption charges; and (3) conducting unbiased recruitment and training of election officials. Urges the government of Nigeria to respect the freedoms of association and assembly, including the right of candidates, members of political parties, and others to assemble and conduct public events free from intimidation. Urges a robust effort by Nigeria's law enforcement and judicial officials to enforce the rule of law, particularly by preventing and investigating politically-motivated violence and prosecuting those suspected of such acts. Expresses U.S. support for coordinated efforts by the government of Nigeria and the Independent National Electoral Commission to work with political parties, civil society, religious organizations, and other entities to organize a peaceful democratic transition based on free elections in April 2007."
