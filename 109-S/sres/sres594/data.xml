Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) on the fourth anniversary of his passing, Senator Paul Wellstone should be remembered for his compassion and leadership on social issues throughout his career; (2) Congress should act to help U.S. citizens who live with a mental illness by enacting legislation to provide for equal coverage of mental health benefits with respect to health insurance coverage unless comparable limits are imposed on medical and surgical benefits; and (3) mental health parity legislation should be a priority for consideration in the 110th Congress.</summary>
