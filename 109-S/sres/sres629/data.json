Requires that at least 25 years have passed since: (1) the death of any subject in a portrait included in the artwork; or (2) the commemorative event that is to be portrayed in it. Requires also that the Senate has passed a Senate resolution approving the Commission's recommendation. Declares that it is the sense of the Senate that the Commission consider specified factors before making an affixation recommendation. Requires the Commission, if a request meets the requirements of this Act, to select the artist and supervise the creation of the artwork and its application to the selected surface."
