  <summary>2/17/2005--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should engage in international dialogue regarding mercury pollution, use, mining, and trade. Calls for the President to: (1) prepare a strategy to advance and enter into international negotiations on an agreement that addresses the reduction of the global use, trade, and releases of mercury; (2) enter into agreements to align global mercury production with reduced global demand and to minimize global mercury releases while negotiating such an agreement; (3) initiate and support a parallel international research effort to collect global data for a comprehensive inventory of mercury use, mining, trade, and releases and to develop less emitting technologies and technologies to reduce the need for, and use of, mercury in commerce; (4) review U.S. monitoring capabilities and data collection efforts for mercury use, trade, and releases; (5) work through existing international organizations to encourage the development of programs, standards, and trade agreements to reduce the use and trade of mercury, eliminate primary mercury mining, and reduce releases of mercury and other long-range transboundary air pollutants; and (6) present a plan to reduce global mercury exposure and pollution at the 23rd session of the United Nations Environment Programme Governing Council in order to advance the goal of achieving a binding international agreement on mercury.</summary>
