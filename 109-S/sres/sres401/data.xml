  <summary>3/13/2006--Passed Senate without amendment.
Supports the people of Belarus as they face the dictatorship of President Lukashenko, and notes that Belarus' integration into the Western community will suffer delay so long as President Lukashenko prevents the development of a democratic political system. Urges the government of Belarus to ensure a free and transparent 2006 presidential election in accordance with Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) standards. Encourages the international community, including the Council of Europe and the OSCE, to continue supporting democracy in Belarus, and thanks the governments and people of neighboring countries such as Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia for continuing to promote democracy and human rights in Belarus. Expresses the Senate's belief that tyranny in Belarus will not forever endure and that the people of Belarus will one day enjoy the benefits of democracy and human rights.</summary>
