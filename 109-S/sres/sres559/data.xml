  <summary>9/13/2006--Passed Senate without amendment.
Condemns the government of Sudan's: (1) military offensive in Darfur in violation of the terms of the Darfur Peace Agreement (2006) and the N'Djamena cease-fire accord (2004); and (2) rejection of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006). Commends the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) for its monitoring of the N'djamena cease-fire agreement and encourages the African Union (AU) to leave the AMIS force in place until a U.N. peacekeeping mission is deployed to Darfur. Calls upon the government of Sudan to: (1) cease its military offensive in Darfur; and (2) comply with the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to Darfur. Calls upon the United Nations to: (1) deploy as quickly as practicable well trained and equipped peacekeeping troops as authorized by Security Council Resolution 1706; and (2) begin considerations of sanctions as called for by Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004) and Security Council Resolution 1564 (2004). Urges the President to help improve the security situation in Darfur by: (1) pursuing the imposition of a "no-fly zone" in Darfur in cooperation with the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), or NATO allies; (2) garnering support for NATO assistance with the AU handover of AMIS to the United Nations; (3) obtaining the support of China, Russia, and U.S. allies in the Arab League to secure Sudan's compliance with U.N. peacekeeper deployment; (4) supporting full funding for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sudan; (5) securing U.N. member state support for a special session on Sudan in the U.N. Human Rights Council; and (6) appointing a Special Envoy to Sudan to head the Office of the Presidential Special Envoy. Urges the international community to: (1) support the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to Darfur financially, with logistical and equipment support, or through troop contributions; (2) fulfill financial obligations to U.N. and international humanitarian aid agencies for responding to the crisis in Darfur or addressing humanitarian needs throughout Sudan; (3) impose targeted sanctions against members of the National Congress Party responsible for human rights violations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity; and (4) impose sanctions consistent with Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564.</summary>
