Commends the desire of the people of Nepal for a democratic system of government and expresses support for their right to protest peacefully in pursuit of this goal. Acknowledges the April 24, 2006, statement by King Gyanendra regarding his intent to reinstate Parliament. Urges the Palace, the political parties, and the Maoists to support a process that returns the country to multi-party democracy. Declares that the transition to democracy in Nepal must be peaceful and that violence risks sending Nepal into a state of anarchy. Calls on Nepal's security forces to exercise maximum restraint and to uphold the highest standards of conduct in their response to the protests. Urges the release of political detainees and the restoration of full civilian and political rights. Urges the Maoists to lay down their arms and to pursue their goals through a peaceful political process. Calls on the U.S. government to work closely with other governments, including those of India, China, the United Kingdom, the European Union (EU), and the United Nations to help bring about a peaceful democratic transition in Nepal."
