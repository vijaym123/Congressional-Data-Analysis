Expresses support for: (1) the people of Sri Lanka as they recover from the December 2004 tsunami, and the August 2005 assassination of the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakhsman Kadirgamar; and (2) the courageous decision by the government of Sri Lanka, following the assassination, to remain in discussions with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in an attempt to resolve peacefully the issues facing the people of Sri Lanka. Urges: (1) all parties in Sri Lanka to remain committed to the negotiating process; and (2) all outside parties to support a free democratic process in the scheduled November 2005 Sri Lankan elections, and to work to prevent extremist groups in Sri Lanka from interfering with that process.</summary>
