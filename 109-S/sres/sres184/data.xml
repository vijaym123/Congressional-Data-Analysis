  <summary>6/29/2005--Introduced.
Welcomes recent attempts by the U.N. Secretary General to address the issue of anti-Semitism, and calls on the United Nations to condemn anti-Semitic statements in its meetings and hold member states accountable for such statements. Urges the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to develop and implement Holocaust education programs as part of an effort against anti-Semitism and racial, religious, and ethnic intolerance. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should direct the Secretary of State to: (1) include in the Department of State's annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and annual Report on International Religious Freedom information on activities at the United Nations and its constituent bodies relating to anti-Semitism by each of the countries included in these reports; and (2) use projects funded through the Middle East Partnership Initiative and U.S. overseas broadcasts to educate Arab and Muslim countries about anti-Semitism, religious intolerance, and incitement to violence.</summary>
