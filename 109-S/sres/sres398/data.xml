Declares that the U.S. Senate censures George W. Bush, President of the United States, and condemns: (1) his unlawful authorization of wiretaps of Americans within the United States without obtaining the court orders required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA); (2) his failure to inform the full congressional intelligence committees as required by law; and (3) his efforts to mislead the American people about the authorities relied upon by his Administration to conduct wiretaps and about the legality of the program.</summary>
