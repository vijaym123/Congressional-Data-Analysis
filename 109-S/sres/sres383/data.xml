  <summary>3/2/2006--Passed Senate without amendment.
Condemns the continued: (1) attacks on civilians in Darfur by the government of Sudan and the and government-sponsored militias; and (2) violations of the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement by the government and rebels in Darfur, particularly the Sudan Liberation Army. Commends the Africa Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) in monitoring the Agreement in Darfur and its role in diminishing some acts of violence. Calls on: (1) all parties to abide by the terms of the Agreement and engage in good-faith negotiations to end the conflict in Darfur; (2) the government of Sudan to withdraw all military aircraft from the region, to cease all support for the Janjaweed militia and rebels from Chad, and to disarm the Janjaweed; and (3) the African Union to request assistance from the United Nations (U.N.) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to deter violence and instability until a U.N. peacekeeping force is deployed in Darfur. Calls on the U.N. Security Council to approve a trained and adequate Darfur peacekeeping mission. Urges the President to take steps to help improve the security situation in Darfur by: (1) proposing that NATO consider implementation and enforcement of a no-fly zone in Darfur, and deploy troops to Darfur to support AMIS until a U.N. peacekeeping mission is fully deployed; and (2) requesting supplemental funding to support AMIS and a NATO mission in Darfur.</summary>
