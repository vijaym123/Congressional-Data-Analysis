    "text": "Commends the delegates from the government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army for agreeing to a cessation of hostilities. Recognizes the government of Southern Sudan's leadership in mediating the cessation of hostilities and establishing a framework for peace. Expresses the support of the citizens of the United States for the people of Uganda who have endured decades of violence resulting from that conflict. Entreats all parties to address issues of accountability and impunity for war crimes and crimes against humanity and to support national reconciliation efforts. Encourages the government of Uganda to improve the professionalism of its military personnel, with an emphasis on enhancing respect for human rights, accountability for abuses, and effective protection of civilians. Urges the government of Uganda to augment its resettlement plan by: (1) expanding social services; (2) deploying professional civil servants; and (3) developing the legal, political, and security infrastructure necessary to facilitate the freedom of movement of civilians to their homes, land, and areas within and around camps, and essential to fulfill the needs of returnees and former combatants. Calls on the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), as well as the international community to: (1) provide humanitarian assistance through nongovernmental organizations; (2) pay particular attention to victimized women and children; and (3) provide assistance for the demobilization and reintegration of rebel combatants and abductees, and diplomatic and logistical support for the cessation of hostilities agreement and progress towards peace in Uganda."
