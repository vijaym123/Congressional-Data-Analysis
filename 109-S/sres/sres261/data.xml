  <summary>9/29/2005--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) Hurricane Katrina and other such disasters should not be used to weaken, waive, or roll back federal public health, environmental, and environmental justice laws and regulations; (2) state, local, and regional authorities must retain their authority for compliance and permitting of industrial and other facilities and their role in monitoring and cleanup; (3) testing, monitoring, cleanup, and recovery in areas of national emergency should be completed in a manner designed to protect public health and the environment, ensure habitability, and mitigate against the effects of future storms and in compliance with Executive Order 12898 (requires federal actions to address environmental justice in minority and low-income populations); and (4) the federal rebuilding of the Gulf Region communities and economy should be a model of an integrated, diverse, and sustainable society.</summary>
