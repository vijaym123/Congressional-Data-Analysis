    "text": "Urges reconciliation among the people of Haiti, including a government led by President-elect Rene Preval that respects the rights of all political parties. Supports President-elect Preval's efforts to coordinate municipal and local elections in 2006. Thanks the countries that are contributing personnel to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), particularly Brazil, whose President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced that Brazilian peacekeepers will stay in Haiti for as long as the new government in Haiti needs them. Supports U.S. efforts to encourage Canada, Chile, and Argentina to maintain their commitments to MINUSTAH. Encourages U.N. Security Council members to support current MINUSTAH troop levels and to raise significantly the numbers of U.N. civilian police forces. Urges the international community to support MINUSTAH, fulfill pledges made at the July 2004 International Donors Conference, and plan for a new multi-year commitment of support at a new donor's conference to be held no later than July 2006. Recommends: (1) the creation of an effective demobilization, disarmament, and reintegration program to encompass former military members and gangs; and (2) that the new government cooperate fully with MINUSTAH in assuring police and judiciary reform. Supports U.S. government assistance for Haiti's reconstruction."
