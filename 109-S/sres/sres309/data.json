Declares the Senate's readiness to assist the Jordanian authorities' efforts to bring the responsible individuals to justice. Calls upon the international community to strengthen efforts to: (1) defeat terrorists by dismantling terrorist networks and exposing the violent and nihilistic ideology of terrorism; (2) increase international cooperation to advance personal and religious freedoms, ethnic and racial tolerance, political liberty and pluralism, and economic prosperity; and (3) combat the social injustice, poverty, and extremism that bolsters terrorism."
