  <summary>11/10/2005--Passed Senate without amendment.
Condemns the terrorist attacks on the innocent people of Amman, Jordan, on November 9, 2005. Expresses condolences to the victims' families and friends and extends sympathies to the injured. Expresses the continued solidarity of the people and government of the United States with the people and government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Declares the Senate's readiness to assist the Jordanian authorities' efforts to bring the responsible individuals to justice. Calls upon the international community to strengthen efforts to: (1) defeat terrorists by dismantling terrorist networks and exposing the violent and nihilistic ideology of terrorism; (2) increase international cooperation to advance personal and religious freedoms, ethnic and racial tolerance, political liberty and pluralism, and economic prosperity; and (3) combat the social injustice, poverty, and extremism that bolsters terrorism.</summary>
