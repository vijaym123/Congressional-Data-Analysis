  <summary>6/22/2005--Passed Senate without amendment.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the thousands of innocent people murdered at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 1995, along with all individuals who were victimized during the conflict and genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995, should be remembered and honored; (2) the Serbian policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing meet the terms defining genocide; (3) foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, who have risked, and in some cases lost, their lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be remembered and honored; (4) the United Nations (UN) and its member states should accept their share of responsibility for allowing the Srebrenica massacre and genocide to occur; (5) it is in the U.S. national interest that the responsible individuals should be held accountable for their actions; (6) persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) should be apprehended and transferred to The Hague without further delay, and countries should meet their obligations to cooperate with the ICTY; and (7) the United States should support the independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and peace and stability in southeastern Europe.</summary>
