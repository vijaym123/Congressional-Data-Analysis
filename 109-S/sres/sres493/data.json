Commends Finucane family members for their courageous campaign to seek the truth in this case of collusion. Welcomes the passage of a resolution by the Dail Eireann on March 8, 2006, calling for the establishment of an independent public judicial inquiry into the Finucane murder as the Irish government's most recent expression of support for the Finucane family. Acknowledges the U.S. Helsinki Commission for their work in highlighting this case. Supports the efforts of The Honorable Mitchell Reiss, President Bush's special envoy for the Northern Ireland Peace Process, in pushing for the full implementation of the Weston Park Agreement and the establishment of an independent judicial inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane."
