Amends Rule XXXVII (Conflict of Interest) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to prohibit Members of the Senate from using any charitable tax-exempt organization for personal or political gain. Specifies conditions under which a Senator shall be considered to have used such organization for such purpose. Requires Senators and their employees to disclose to the Secretary of the Senate the identity of any person who makes to such an organization a contribution of over $200 and of which such Member or employee knows. Requires the Secretary to make such disclosures public. Authorizes the Select Committee on Ethics to grant a waiver to Members with respect to this Act in the case of an organization over whose affairs the Member's spouse, but not the Member, is in a position to exercise substantial influence.</summary>
