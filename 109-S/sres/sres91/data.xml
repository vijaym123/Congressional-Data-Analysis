  <summary>3/17/2005--Passed Senate without amendment.
Supports the U.S. embargo on the People's Republic of China (PRC). Urges the European Union (EU) to: (1) continue its ban on all arms exports to the PRC; (2) make its Code of Conduct on Arms Exports legally enforceable in all EU states; (3) more carefully regulate the end-use of military and dual-use technology; and (4) increase transparency in its arms and dual-use export control regimes. Encourages the U.S. Government to make clear that a lifting of such EU arms embargo would potentially adversely affect transatlantic defense cooperation, including future transfers of U.S. military technology, services, and equipment to EU countries. Deplores the ongoing human rights abuses in the PRC. Urges the United States and the EU to develop a common strategy to seek: (1) human rights improvement in the PRC; (2) an end to the PRC's military build-up aimed at Taiwan; (3) improvement in the PRC's export control practices; (4) an end to the proliferation by state-sponsored entities in the PRC of technology related to weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles; and (5) an end to the proliferation by state and non-state owned entities and individuals in the PRC of military equipment involving countries, such as Burma and Sudan, whose armies have played a role in human rights violations against members of ethnic and religious minorities.</summary>
