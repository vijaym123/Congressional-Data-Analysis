  <summary>2/14/2006--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Minerals Management Service should suspend all future royalty relief until the Secretary of the Interior can ensure that the citizens of the United States receive a fair return from oil and gas resources from the outer Continental Shelf; and (2) Congress must take steps to ensure that the oil and gas industry does not receive a windfall and is not unjustly enriched at citizen expense.</summary>
