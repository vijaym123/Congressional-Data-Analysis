  <summary>6/30/2005--Introduced.
Declares that: (1) a reformed United Nations (UN) can play an important role in promoting global peace and security; and (2) UN oversight must be improved, including implementation of whistleblower protections. Reaffirms that United Nations Security Council reform would constitute a treaty revision of the UN Charter requiring an affirmative two-thirds majority vote in the Senate, and declares that UN reforms must be implemented before the Senate will consider changes to the UN Charter. States that the United Nations Human Rights Commission should be abolished and replaced by a United Nations Human Rights Council or other body composed of governments committed to upholding human rights. Urges the Secretary of State to consult regularly with the Senate as deliberations on UN reform progress.</summary>
