  <summary>4/25/2006--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the Iraqi political, religious, and tribal leaders should be told by the Administration that: (1) the continued U.S. military presence in Iraq is not unconditional; (2) whether the Iraqis avoid all-out civil war and have a future as a nation is in their hands; and (3) forming a government of national unity and subsequent agreement to modifications to the Iraq Constitution to make it more inclusive, within the deadlines the Iraqis have set for themselves in the Iraq Constitution, is essential to defeating the insurgency and avoiding all-out civil war, and a condition of the continued U.S. military presence.</summary>
