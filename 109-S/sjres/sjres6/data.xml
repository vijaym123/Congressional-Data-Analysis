  <summary>2/17/2005--Introduced.
Constitutional Amendment - Authorizes the Congress by law (approved by two-thirds of both Houses) to provide for the death or inability of Members of the House of Representatives and Members of the Senate, in the event that one-fourth of either House is killed or incapacitated, declaring who shall serve until the disability is removed, or a new Member is elected. Declares that such procedures shall expire by 120 days after the death or inability of one-fourth of the House or the Senate. Allows an additional 120-day extension, however, if one-fourth of either House remains vacant or occupied by members unable to serve.</summary>
