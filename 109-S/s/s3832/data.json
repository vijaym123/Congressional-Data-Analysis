Requires that such criteria include: (1) requirements that beneficiaries be willing to have title transferred to them, be capable of assuming facility operations, maintenance, and rehabilitation, and be willing to assume liability for such facilities; (2) a requirement for an assessment by the Secretary of effects of the transfer on the government's ability to carry out its Indian tribal trust responsibility, costs savings to the United States, legal and environmental considerations, adverse impacts on stakeholders, and the beneficiaries' interest in owning the facility, ability to meet financial obligations, and willingness and ability to fulfill legal obligations; (3) procedures for soliciting stakeholder involvement and for involving appropriate federal, state, and local entities in evaluating and carrying out the transfer; (4) a requirement that the Secretary prepare a comprehensive list of items that need to be accomplished before the transfer; and (5) procedures to allow the Secretary to address real property and cultural and historic preservation issues in a more efficient manner. Directs the Secretary to incorporate any existing applicable criteria."
