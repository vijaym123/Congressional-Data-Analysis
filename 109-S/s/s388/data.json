Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish: (1) an Interagency Coordinating Committee on Climate Change Technology to coordinate Federal climate change activities and programs to promote such strategy; and (2) a permanent Climate Change Technology Program to assist the Committee in the interagency coordination of climate change technology research, development, and demonstration, and deployment to reduce greenhouse gas intensity. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish the Climate Change Science Program to assist the Committee in the interagency coordination of climate change science research. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) conduct an inventory and evaluation of greenhouse gas intensity reducing technologies to determine suitable commercialization and deployment technologies; (2) use inventory results for guidance in such commercialization; (3) establish a Climate Change Technology Working Group to identify major statutory, regulatory, and economic barriers to such commercialization; and (4) establish within the Department of Energy a Climate Credit Board to implement the greenhouse gas intensity reducing technology deployment program, using energy credit financial support for eligible projects. Requires the President to establish a national greenhouse gas registry to serve as the depository for data on greenhouse gas emissions and emission reductions."
