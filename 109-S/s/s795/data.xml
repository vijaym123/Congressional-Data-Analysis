Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2005 (STANDUP Act) - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to award incentive grants to States with graduated driver licensing laws that include for novice drivers under age 21: (1) a three-stage licensing process (including a learner's permit stage and an intermediate stage before an unrestricted driver's license is granted); (2) a prohibition on nighttime driving during the learner's permit and intermediate stages; (3) a prohibition (during the learner's permit and intermediate stages) against operating a motor vehicle with more than one non-familial passenger under age 21 if there is no licensed driver 21 years old or older present in the vehicle; and (4) any other requirement that the Secretary may require. Directs the Secretary to withhold a certain amount of Federal-aid highway funds from States that are not in compliance with the requirements of this Act.</summary>
