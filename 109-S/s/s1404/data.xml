Amends federal transportation law to provide that a terminal development project at a nonhub primary airport shall remain as an allowable cost, as well as eligible for funding from the discretionary fund and the small airport fund, even though its status changes to a small hub primary airport at the time when the airport has received discretionary funds for such project, and the project is not yet completed.</summary>
