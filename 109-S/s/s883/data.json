Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) provide assistance to developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas intensity; (2) inventory greenhouse gas intensity reducing technologies and identify appropriate technologies for developing countries; (3) develop a technology strategic plan and carry out demonstration projects in at least ten countries; and (4) carry out fellowship and exchange programs for officials from developing countries to acquire U.S. expertise in greenhouse gas intensity reduction practices. Directs the U.S. Trade Representative to seek to eliminate foreign trade barriers to the export of U.S. greenhouse gas intensity reducing technologies and practices. Establishes an interagency working group to carry out a greenhouse gas intensity reducing technology export initiative. Terminates programs under this Act as of December 31, 2010."
