  <summary>4/14/2005--Introduced.
Safeguarding Americans From Exporting Identification Data Act or the SAFE-ID Act - Prohibits business enterprises from disclosing personally identifiable information regarding U.S. residents to any branch, affiliate, subcontractor, or unaffiliated third party located in a foreign country unless: (1) the business enterprise provides notice of privacy protections and complies with safeguards described in specified Federal laws; (2) the consumer is given the opportunity to object prior to such disclosure; and (3) the consumer is given an explanation of how to exercise the nondisclosure option. Prohibits: (1) health care businesses from terminating existing relationships with consumers to avoid objections to disclosure; and (2) business enterprises from discriminating against otherwise qualified consumers of financial products or health care services due to such objections. Makes business enterprises that knowingly and directly transfer personally identifiable information to foreign entities liable to persons suffering damages due to the misuse of that information. Authorizes injured parties to file civil actions for violations of the information transmission provisions of this Act. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to revise existing regulations to require covered entities that outsource protected health information to a foreign country to include certain information relating to outsourcing in such entity's privacy protection notices. Amends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to require the inclusion of similar information in privacy protection notices for consumers of financial services.</summary>
