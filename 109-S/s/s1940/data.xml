  <summary>10/31/2005--Introduced.
Childhelp National Registry Act - Directs the Attorney General to create a national register of cases of child abuse or neglect (abuse), with the information in the register supplied to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by states (or local governments at state option) and Indian tribes. Requires: (1) such information to relate to substantiated reports of abuse and case-specific identification; and (2) each reporting entity to determine whether such information also relates to reports of suspected instances of abuse that were unsubstantiated or unfounded, except that reported information must be coextensive with any equivalent register of abuse cases maintained by such entity. Directs the Attorney General to establish standards for the dissemination of information in the national register that preserve the confidentiality of records.</summary>
