Allows the Secretary to: (1) use milestone-based awards and payments; (2) make awards to and enter into transactions with highly qualified foreign national persons outside the United States; (3) establish one or more federally-funded research and development centers or university-affiliated research centers if it is not feasible or appropriate to establish an arrangement with an existing research center; (4) give priority to the advanced research and development of qualified countermeasures and qualified pandemic or epidemic products that are likely to be safe and effective with respect to children, pregnant women, the elderly, and other at-risk individuals; (5) appoint highly qualified individuals to scientific or professional positions in BARDA without regard to federal provisions governing appointments in the competitive service; and (6) appoint special consultants. Establishes the Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Development Fund to carry out this section. Requires the Secretary to withhold from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act specific technical data or scientific information that is created or obtained during the countermeasure and product advanced research and development carried out under this section that reveals significant and not otherwise known vulnerabilities of existing medical or public health defenses against biological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological threats. (Sec. 402) Requires the Secretary to establish the National Biodefense Science Board to provide expert advice and guidance to the Secretary on scientific, technical, and other matters of special interest to HHS regarding current and future chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological agents. Allows the Secretary to establish a working group of experts, or use an existing group, to: (1) identify innovative research with the potential to be developed as a qualified countermeasure or a qualified pandemic or epidemic product; (2) identify accepted animal models for particular diseases and conditions associated with any biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent, any toxin, or any potential pandemic infectious disease, and identify strategies to accelerate animal model and research tool development and validation; and (3) obtain advise regarding qualified countermeasures and qualified pandemic or epidemic products that are likely to be safe and effective with respect to children, pregnant women, and other vulnerable populations. (Sec. 403) Includes within the definition of \"qualified countermeasure\" a biological agent or toxin to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or treat harm, including organisms that cause an infectious disease. (Sec. 404) Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Secretary to establish within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a team of experts on manufacturing and regulatory activities to provide technical assistance to the manufacturers of qualified countermeasures, security countermeasures, or vaccines if the Secretary determines that a shortage or potential shortage may occur. (Sec. 405) Allows the Secretary to conduct meetings and consultations with persons engaged in the development of a security countermeasure, qualified countermeasure, or qualified pandemic or epidemic product for the purpose of the development, manufacture, distribution, purchase, or storage of a countermeasure or product. Requires such meetings and consultations to be conducted so as to ensure that national security, confidential, and proprietary information is not disclosed outside the meeting or consultations. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring the disclosure of confidential commercial or proprietary information. Exempts such meetings and consultations from antitrust laws. Requires the Secretary to file a written agreement regarding such covered activities. Requires the Attorney General to grant such exemption if the conduct will not have any substantial anticompetitive effect that is not reasonably necessary for ensuring the availability of the countermeasure or product involved. (Sec. 406) Requires the Secretary to institute a process for making publicly available the results of assessments of specific countermeasures to address specific threats while withholding information that would reveal public vulnerabilities or would otherwise be exempt from public disclosure. Allows partial payment on a procurement contract for a security countermeasure for significant milestones or a payment to increase manufacturing capacity. Allows procurement contracts to provide: (1) for advance payments for milestones; (2) that the vendor is the sole and exclusive supplier of the product to the government for a specified period if the vendor is able to satisfy the government's needs; (3) that the vendor establish domestic manufacturing capacity of the product to ensure that additional production is available as necessary; (4) dosing and administration requirements for countermeasures; (5) the amount of funding that will be dedicated by the Secretary for countermeasure research and development; and (6) specifications the countermeasure must meet to qualify for procurement under a contract."
