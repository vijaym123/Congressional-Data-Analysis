Provides emergency tree assistance to commercial orchardists and timber producers who incurred qualifying natural disaster-caused losses in 2005. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to use Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds to carry out the 2002 livestock compensation program for eligible: (1) livestock producers who are in a disaster county; and (2) catfish producers."
