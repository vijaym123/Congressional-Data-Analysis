  <summary>9/8/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Hurricane Disasters Assistance Act, 2005 to provide emergency crop disaster assistance to agricultural producers who incurred qualifying 2005 losses due to damaging weather or related conditions. (Eliminates the provision limiting 2005 crop assistance to only producers who suffered losses in 2004 from hurricanes or tropical storms in disaster-designated counties.) Provides emergency tree assistance to commercial orchardists and timber producers who incurred qualifying natural disaster-caused losses in 2005. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to use Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds to carry out the 2002 livestock compensation program for eligible: (1) livestock producers who are in a disaster county; and (2) catfish producers.</summary>
