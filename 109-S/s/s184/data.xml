  <summary>1/26/2005--Introduced.
Safe Importation of Medical Products and Other Rx Therapies Act of 2005 or Safe IMPORT Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow individuals to import Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription drugs from Canada for personal use. Permits the importation of prescription drugs from Canada by registered Internet pharmacies, pharmacies, or wholesalers in one year under specified conditions, including meeting proper labeling on all dispensed drugs to indicate that the drug has been imported. Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to designate additional countries from which to allow importation in three years. Requires the Secretary to give high priority to improving the information management systems of the FDA to improve the detection of intentionally adulterated prescription drugs. Sets forth Internet pharmacy licensing requirements and procedures. Makes providers of interactive computer and advertising services liable for violations under this Act if such providers accept advertising: (1) for a prescription drug from an unlicensed Internet pharmacy; or (2) stating that an individual does not need a prescription to obtain a prescription drug. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations requiring designated payment systems, including credit card companies, to prevent sales by unlicensed Internet pharmacies. Allows the FDA to detain or temporarily hold prescription drug shipments based on credible information that a drug presents a risk to the public health. Allows the Secretary to: (1) suspend or debar importation of a particular drug or dosage that poses such a risk or by a particular importer who violates Act requirements; (2) require owners of prescription drugs that have been refused admission into the United States to indicate that information on the drug containers; and (3) authorize other Federal and State officials to conduct inspections to enforce compliance with this Act Deems to be misbranded a prescription drug offered for importation that has previously been refused admission, unless the person reoffering the drug affirmatively establishes that it complies with applicable requirements. Sets forth anti-counterfeiting provisions.</summary>
