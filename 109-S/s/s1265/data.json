Defines \"verified technology\" as a pollution control technology (including a retrofit technology), advanced truckstop electrification system, or auxiliary power unit that has been verified by the Administrator or the California Air Resources Board. Limits to 10% the amount of funding available to eligible entities for the development and commercialization of emerging technologies. Defines \"emerging technology\" as an uncertified technology for which an approvable application and test plan has been submitted for verification to the Administrator or the California Air Resources Board). Sets forth grant and loan application requirements for eligible entities, priorities for awarding such grants or loans, and criteria for use of funds provided by this Act. (Sec. 4) Requires the Administrator to: (1) use 30% of the funding provided by this Act to support state grant and loan programs to reduce diesel emissions; (2) provide certain guidance to states for such programs; (3) make funding allocations; and (4) award additional funding (50%) to states that match allocations. (Sec. 5) Directs the Administrator, not later than one year after funds are first available under this Act and biennially thereafter, to submit to Congress reports evaluating the implementation of programs under this Act. (Sec. 6) Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish a program to inform industry stakeholders (equipment owners and operators, emission and pollution control technology manufacturers, engine and equipment manufacturers, state and local air quality managers, community organizations, and public health, educational, and environmental organizations) of the benefits of eligible technologies (defined as verified or emerging technologies); (2) develop nonfinancial incentives to promote the use of such technologies; (3) develop appropriate guidance to provide credit to a state for emission reductions created by eligible technologies though a Clean Air Act state implementation plan; and (4) in coordination with the Department of Commerce and industry stakeholders, inform foreign countries with air quality problems of the potential of U.S. technology to reduce emissions in those countries. (Sec. 7) Affirms that nothing in this Act affects any authority under the Clean Air Act in existence prior to the enactment of this Act. (Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2011."
