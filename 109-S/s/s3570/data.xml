Allows Program grantees to extend the period of participation for no more than 20% of the project participants. Requires the grantee, in selecting participants for such extended period, to give priority to participants age 65 and older, frail older individuals, and individuals who have specified barriers to employment. Authorizes grantees to petition for a waiver of the 36-month limit if the grantee serves a high concentration of individuals who are hard-to-serve because they have more than one specified barrier to employment. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Program was created with the intent of placing older individuals in community service positions to provide job training placements; and (2) placing older individuals in such positions strengthens the ability of individuals to become self-sufficient, provides volunteer support to organizations that benefit from increased civic engagement, and strengthens the communities served. Requires the Secretary of Labor to consult with the Assistant Secretary regarding establishing and implementing performance measures for grantees.. Includes among factors for which the levels of performance (applicable to performance indicators) may be adjusted: (1) not less than 60% of counties in areas served by grantees are rural; and (2) the areas served by the grantee comprise a difficult-to-serve territory due to limited economies of scale. Eliminates the requirement that grants be awarded for a period of a year by requiring the Secretary to award grants to carry out projects for a four-year period through a competitive process that emphasizes meeting performance measures. Stipulates than an applicant is eligible to receive a grant according to criteria in current law. Adds the following as criteria for grantee selection: (1) the applicant's performance and the applicant's ability to meet the required indicators; and (2) the applicant's ability to administer a program that provides community service and to minimize disruption in services for participants and employers. Repeals provisions concerning corrective action for a grantee's failure to meet performance standards and instead requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance to the grantee. Adds the following groups to the definition of individuals with barriers to employment: minority and Indian individuals, individuals with limited English proficiency, and individuals with greatest economic need. Requires a national grant recipient, in selecting subgrantees in areas where a substantial population of individuals with barriers to employment exists, to give special consideration to selecting organizations with demonstrated expertise in serving individuals with barriers to employment. Prohibits the Secretary from promulgating rules affecting grantees in areas where a substantial population of minority individuals exists that would significantly compromise the ability of grantees to serve their targeted populations. (Sec. 47) Prohibits the Secretary, for purposes of determining income eligibility under the program, from including as income: unemployment compensation, specified benefits received under the Social Security Act, and payments made to or on behalf of veterans or former members of the Armed Forces under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, or 25% of the old-age and survivors insurance benefits under the Social Security Act. (Sec. 49) Authorizes appropriations for: (1) the Native American Caregiver Support Program; (2) vulnerable elder rights protection activities; and (3) eligible Native American entity elder rights activities. (Sec. 51) Requires state agencies to use allotments for programs for the prevention of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation to provide for public education and outreach to promote financial literacy and prevent identity theft and financial exploitation. (Sec. 53) Establishes as purposes of the Elder Justice Programs: (1) to assist states and Indian tribes in developing a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to elder justice; (2) to promote research and data collection that will fill gaps in knowledge about elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation (abuse); (3) to support activities of service providers and programs that are designed to address issues relating to such abuse; (4) to assist states, tribes, and local service providers in the development of strategic plans for the development and coordination of elder justice research, programs, studies, and training; and (5) to promote collaborative efforts and diminish overlap and gaps in efforts in developing the important field of elder justice. Authorizes the Assistant Secretary to award grants to states and tribes to strengthen long-term care and provide assistance for elder justice programs. Authorizes a state or tribe that receives a grant to use the funds to award grants to eligible entities: (1) for the prevention, detection, assessment, and treatment of, intervention in, investigation of, and response to abuse; (2) to examine various types of elder shelters and to test models for establishing such shelters; (3) to establish or continue volunteer programs that focus on the issues of abuse or to provide related services; (4) to support multidisciplinary elder justice activities; (5) to provide training for individuals with respect to abuse issues; (6) to address underserved populations of elders; (7) to provide incentives for individuals to train for, seek, and maintain employment providing direct care in a long-term care facility; (8) to encourage the establishment of partnerships to develop approaches to improve the quality of long-term care; and (9) to establish multidisciplinary panels to develop best practices concerning methods of improving the quality of long-term care and addressing abuse. Requires the Assistant Secretary to develop accountability measures and to evaluate program activities. Authorizes funds for FY2005-FY2008 to carry out grants authorized to states and tribes to strengthen long-term care and provide assistance for elder justice programs.
