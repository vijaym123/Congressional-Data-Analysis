Surface Transportation Safety Improvement Act of 2005 - Title I: Motor Carrier Safety - Subtitle A: Motor Carriers - Motor Carrier Safety Reauthorization Act of 2005 - (Sec. 103) Amends federal transportation law to authorize appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) (other than the Mass Transit Account) for FY2006-FY2009 for: (1) administrative expenses of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA); and (2) FMCSA grant programs, including border enforcement grants, performance and registration information system management grants, commercial driver's license and driver improvement program grants, and grants for the commercial vehicle information systems and networks deployment program. (Sec. 104) Requires the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary), using HTF funds, to ensure that high-risk carrier compliance reviews are completed on motor carriers that have demonstrated through performance data that they pose the highest safety risk. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to complete certain overdue reports, studies, and rulemaking proceedings. (Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary to: (1) amend the Interim Final Rule addressing New Motor Carrier Entrant Requirements so as to require that a safety audit be immediately converted to a compliance review and appropriate enforcement actions be taken if the safety audit discloses acute safety violations by the new entrant; and (2) ensure that federal motor carrier safety regulations applicable to interstate operations of commercial motor vehicles designed to transport between nine and 15 passengers (including driver) apply to all interstate operations of such carriers regardless of the distance traveled. (Sec. 107) Revises requirements for state motor carrier safety plans to include: (1) implementation of performance-based activities for commercial vehicles of passengers and freight; (2) inspections of motor carriers of passengers conducted at stations, terminals, border crossings, or maintenance facilities, except in the case of an imminent or obvious safety hazard; (3) information in the training manuals for the driver's license examination on best practices for driving safely in the vicinity of commercial motor vehicles as well as noncommercial vehicles; and (4) enforcement of motor carrier registration requirements by suspending the operation of any vehicle discovered to be operating without registration or beyond the scope of its registration. Authorizes the use of state motor carrier safety grants for documented enforcement of state traffic laws and regulations against noncommercial motor vehicles when necessary to promote commercial motor vehicle safety. Authorizes appropriations from the HTF (other than the Mass Transit Account) for FY2006-FY2009 for grants to states for commercial motor carrier safety (earmarking amounts for high priority activities and projects that improve commercial motor vehicle safety, audits of new entrant motor carriers, and commercial driver's license information system modernization). Authorizes the Secretary to make a border enforcement grant to a state sharing a border with another country to carry out border commercial motor vehicle safety programs and related enforcement activities and projects.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish, review, and revise medical standards for applicants for and holders of commercial driver's licenses (CDLs); and (2) establish a national registry of medical examiners. (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary to revise the final rule to allow individuals who use insulin to treat their diabetes to operate commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring individuals to have experience operating commercial motor vehicles while using insulin in order to qualify to operate one. Allows the Secretary, however, to require an individual to have used insulin for a minimum period of time and demonstrated stable control of diabetes in order to qualify to operate a commercial motor vehicle. (Sec. 112) Authorizes the Secretary to require private motor carriers (not for compensation) that transport passengers or property to file with the Secretary evidence of minimum levels of financial responsibility for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles, or for loss or damage to property, or both. (Sec. 113) Increases civil penalties for persons who: (1) fail to make, or falsely prepare, a required report to the Secretary; (2) violate certain requirements regarding qualifications and maximum hours of service for employees of, and the safety of operation and equipment of, a motor carrier, private motor carrier, or migrant worker motor carrier; or (3) operate a commercial motor vehicle and violate an out-of-service order. (Sec. 114) Revises safety fitness requirements for a owner or operator of a commercial motor vehicle that transports passengers and hazmats. Prohibits such an owner or operator determined not fit to operate in interstate commerce from operating any commercial motor vehicle that affects interstate commerce (including intrastate commerce), until the Secretary determines that such owner or operator is fit. Sets forth similar requirements for determinations of unfitness by a state. (Sec. 115) Amends federal criminal law to require a driver of a commercial motor vehicle to stop and submit to inspection of the vehicle, driver, cargo, and required records when directed to do so by an authorized FMCSA employee. Sets forth criminal penalties for knowing failure to do so or for leaving the inspection site without authorization. Grants FMCSA employees the authority to direct a driver of a commercial vehicle to stop for inspection at or in the vicinity of an inspection site. (Sec. 116) Amends federal transportation law to direct the Secretary to revoke the registration of: (1) a motor carrier that has been prohibited from operating in interstate commerce for failure to comply with commercial motor vehicle safety fitness requirements; and (2) a motor carrier of passengers if the Secretary finds that such carrier has been conducting unsafe operations which are an imminent hazard to public health or property. (Sec. 117) Authorizes the Secretary to suspend, amend, or revoke any part of a motor carrier's registration if an officer of the motor carrier engages in a pattern or practice of avoiding compliance, or masking or concealing noncompliance, with commercial motor vehicle safety regulations. (Sec. 118) Directs the Secretary to establish and carry out a motor carrier and motor coach research and technology program. (Sec. 119) Authorizes the Secretary to use certain funds to participate and cooperate in international activities to enhance motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, driver, and highway safety by such means as exchanging information, conducting research, and examining needs, best practices, and new technology.

(Sec. 122) Authorizes the Secretary, through the NHTSA and FMCSA, to undertake outreach and education initiatives (including the "Share the Road Safely" program) that will reduce the number of highway accidents, injuries, and fatalities involving commercial motor vehicles. Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2009. (Sec. 123) Directs FMCSA to conduct outreach and provide training to state personnel engaged in the enforcement of FMCSA safety regulations to ensure: (1) their awareness of the process for verification of the operating authority of motor carriers (including buses); and (2) proper enforcement when motor carriers are in violation of operating authority requirements. Requires FMCSA to study and report to Congress on the degree to which Canadian and Mexican commercial motor vehicles (including buses) operating in the United states comply with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. (Sec. 124) Directs the Secretary to provide companies conducting preemployment screening services for the motor carrier industry electronic access to commercial motor vehicle accident reports and all driver safety violations in the Motor Carrier Management Information System. (Sec. 125) Requires the Director of the Office of Intermodalism (within the Research and Innovative Technology Administration) to use certain funds, otherwise available for grants to states to develop model state intermodal transportation plans, to provide technical assistance for intermodal data collection. Requires the Director to develop a national intermodal system improvement plan that assesses the national intermodal transportation system and makes recommendations for improving intermodal policy. Requires the Director to submit biennially to Congress a report on the plan to improve the national intermodal transportation system. (Sec. 126) Prohibits the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance from restricting the sale of inspection decals to FMCSA unless FMCSA fails to meet its responsibilities under its memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Alliance (other than a failure due to FMCSA's compliance with federal law). (Sec. 127) Directs the Secretary to issue regulations establishing a program to ensure the safety of intermodal equipment used to transport intermodal containers. Authorizes the Secretary to inspect intermodal equipment, and copy related maintenance and repair records, on demand and display of proper credentials.

States that certain maximum motor carrier driver hours of service federal safety regulations shall not apply to a driver of a utility service vehicle. Prohibits state and local governments from enacting any similar requirements. Subtitle B: Unified Carrier Registration - Unified Carrier Registration Act of 2005 - (Sec. 133) Amends federal transportation law with regard to registered motor carriers providing transportation or service. Deems any person registered with the Secretary as of January 1, 2005, to provide transportation or service as a motor carrier (including otherwise exempt motor carriers like intermodal carriers, transporters of agricultural products, freight forwarders, brokers, and leasing companies) or a motor private carrier, but not registered under specified motor carrier requirements, to be registered to provide such transportation or service under the Unified Carrier Registration System. Requires a registered motor carrier (except a motor private carrier) to file a bond with the Secretary. Revises certain registration requirements. (Sec. 134) Directs the Secretary to issue regulations to establish an on-line Federal Unified Carrier Registration System to replace specified current systems. Requires the Secretary (who currently is authorized) to establish a fee system for the Unified Carrier Registration System. Excludes from registration requirements under this system motor carriers, motor private carriers of property, or transporters of waste or recyclable materials operating exclusively in intrastate transportation. (Sec. 135) Terminates the requirement for a single state motor carrier registration system. Makes it an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce for any state to impose registration requirements or levy fees on for-hire and interstate motor carriers already registered with FMCSA and compliant with other state laws. Provides for a Unified Carrier Registration Agreement (UCR Agreement), which shall govern the collection and distribution of registration and financial responsibility information provided and fees paid by motor carriers, motor private carriers, brokers, freight forwarders, and leasing companies. Establishes a Unified Carrier Registration Plan (UCR Plan) composed of an organization of state, federal, and motor carrier industry representatives responsible for developing, implementing and administering the UCR Agreement. Requires states, to be eligible to participate in the UCR Plan or to receive revenues derived under it, to submit to the Secretary a plan: (1) identifying the state agency to administer the UCR Agreement; and (2) containing assurances that an amount at least equal to the revenue derived by the state from the UCR Agreement will be used for motor carrier safety programs, enforcement, and financial responsibility, or the administration of the UCR Plan and UCR Agreement. (Sec. 136) Prohibits a state, political subdivision, interstate agency, or other political agency of two or more states from enacting or enforcing a law, rule, or regulation standard that requires a motor carrier, motor private carrier, freight forwarder, or leasing company to display any form of identification on or in a commercial motor vehicle, other than a form required by the Secretary. (Sec. 137) Authorizes amounts generated by the UCR Agreement and received by a state and used for motor carrier safety purposes to be included as part of the state's share (matching funds) not provided by the United States. Subtitle C: Commercial Driver's Licenses - (Sec. 151) Directs the Secretary to convene a task force to study and report to Congress on current impediments and foreseeable challenges to the commercial driver's license (CDL) program's effectiveness, and measures needed to realize the full safety potential of the CDL program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2007. (Sec. 152) Limits an individual who operates a commercial motor vehicle to only one learner's permit (as well as one driver's license) at any time. Revises federal CDL minimum standards to require an individual to pass a written test for a CDL license learner's permit on the operation of a commercial motor vehicle that complies with certain minimum fitness standards. (Sec. 153) Authorizes the Secretary to make a grant to: (1) a state to improve its implementation of the CDL program, provided certain requirements are met; and (2) a state agency, local government, or organization representing government agencies or officials for the full cost of research, development, demonstration projects, public education, or other special activities and projects relating to CDL and motor vehicle safety that are of benefit to all jurisdictions or designed to address national safety. (Sec. 154) Establishes the Information System Modernization Account within DOT. Directs the Secretary to develop a comprehensive plan for modernization of the CDL information system.
