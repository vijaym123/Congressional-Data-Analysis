    "text": "Comprehensive Assistance for Veterans Exposed to Traumatic Stressors Act of 2006 - Extends eligibility for readjustment counseling services for Vietnam-era veterans. Requires implementation of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-Department of Defense (DOD) Health Care Sharing Incentive Fund. Requires: (1) the DOD to assist the VA with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health-related data collection; (2) substance use disorder questions in pre- and post-deployment screens and related treatment protocols; and (3) routine preventative maintenance intervention for returning members of the Armed Forces. Requires a study of factors that decrease the likelihood of developing combat-related chronic PTSD. Extends the enhanced eligibility period for VA health services for certain veterans. Provides for a joint demonstration project that stations VA psychologists and psychiatrists at major demobilization sites and military treatment facilities. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to: (1) carry out a program of veteran peer counseling to other veterans on mental health matters; and (2) develop model programs to address mental health disorders prevalent among veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Requires: (1) performance measures that ensure appropriate deployment of resources to implement the Iraq war clinical practice guidelines; (2) establishment of the DOD/VA Council on Post-Deployment Mental Health; (3) a plan for expanded access to specialized PTSD care; and (4) additional mental health services personnel for certain VA programs and locations. Requires counseling for immediate family members of disabled veterans and Armed Forces personnel killed in action. Establishes a National Steering Committee on PTSD Education. Addresses deficiencies in compensation and pension examinations with regard to PTSD. Requires development of criteria for determining which medical conditions are likely associated with PTSD and when secondary service-connection should be granted for those conditions. Provides for an outreach program to enhance PTSD awareness."
