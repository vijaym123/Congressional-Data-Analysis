    "text": "Improved Workplace and Community Transition Training for Incarcerated Youth Offenders Act of 2005 - Amends the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 to authorize the Secretary of Education to establish performance objectives and reporting requirements necessary to assess program effectiveness for state correctional education agencies receiving grants for transition training for incarcerated youth offenders. Requires grant applications to describe specific performance objectives and evaluation methods that the state agency will use, including: (1) specific and quantified student outcome measures that are referenced to outcomes for non-program participants with similar demographic characteristics; and (2) measures of program completion, knowledge and skill attainment, attainment of and success in employment, and recidivism. Requires descriptions of how the proposed programs will consider or utilize technology. Directs each state agency receiving a grant to: (1) report annually to the Secretary on the results of the evaluations and additional performance objectives and on evaluation methods as necessary to document the attainment of performance objectives; and (2) expend on each participating eligible student for an academic year not more than the maximum federal Pell grant for such year, which shall be used for tuition, books, essential materials, and related services such as career development, substance abuse counseling, parenting skills training, and health education. Makes youth offenders age 35 (currently, 25) or younger eligible for participation. Allows related services to continue for up to one year after release from confinement."
