(Sec. 202) Prescribes complementary access procedures, including consents, administrative search warrants, and warrantless complementary access. States it is unlawful for any person willfully to fail, refuse to permit, or otherwise impede complementary access authorized by this Act, or an entry in connection with such access. Title III: Confidentiality of Information - (Sec. 301) Exempts information acquired by the U.S. Government under this Act or under the Additional Protocol from certain statutory disclosure requirements.

Grants federal district courts jurisdiction over civil actions brought by the head of certain designated executive agencies. Title V: Environmental Sampling - (Sec. 501) Requires the President to notify certain congressional committees of IAEA Board approval of wide-area environmental sampling for use as a safeguards verification tool.
