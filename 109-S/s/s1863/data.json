Prohibits the Agency Director and other executive agency heads, except for professional services or in other specified circumstances, from entering into a contract, or awarding a grant, to procure disaster recovery services in connection with reconstruction efforts, unless the contract or grant requires that workers affected by the two hurricanes compose at least 30% of the workforce involved, including those employed by any indirect recipient of such contract or grant fiunds. Establishes within the Agency the Gulf Coast Revitalization Authority, which shall develop a comprehensive plan for rebuilding and improving the public infrastructure of the hurricane-affected Gulf Coast region."
