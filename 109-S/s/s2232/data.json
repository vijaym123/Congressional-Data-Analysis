Authorizes the Secretary to implement such activities at full federal cost, absent a resolution of congressional disapproval, 30 days after the report is submitted. Directs the Secretary, in acquiring property to improve, reconstruct, or develop hurricane and flood protection measures relating to Hurricane Katrina or Rita, to compensate the owner without taking into consideration damage caused by the hurricane. Allows the Secretary to reduce the amount of compensation paid by the amount of any other payment received by the owner, including from an insurance claim or from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)."
