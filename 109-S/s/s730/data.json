    "text": "Mercury Emission Act of 2005 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations establishing emission limitations for mercury emissions by coal-fired electricity generating facilities. Amends the Clean Air Act (CAA) to require the Administrator to promulgate regulations establishing standards for mercury and mercury compound emissions applicable to: (1) coal- and oil-fired boiler units of a specified capacity; (2) chlor-alkali plants that use the mercury cell production process; and (3) Portland cement plants. Sets forth permit requirements. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the Administrator to publish a list of mercury-containing items to be separated and removed from waste streams feeding solid waste facilities. Requires mercury-content labeling by manufacturers of listed items. Requires persons who transfer solid waste that may contain a listed mercury-containing item to submit separation and removal plans. Amends the CAA to direct the Administrator to promulgate regulations concerning measurement of mercury emissions from solid waste combustion flue gases. Sets forth permit requirements. Prohibits, three years after this Act's enactment, the sale of mercury-containing products unless the manufacturer has been granted an exemption. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Administrator to establish an advisory committee to report on the progress made in complying with this Act's amendments to the CAA. Increases funding for the National Atmospheric Deposition Program Mercury Deposition Network. Requires various mercury-related studies and reports."
