  <summary>7/18/2006--Introduced.
America's Opportunity Scholarships for Kids Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to local educational agencies, state educational agencies, or nonprofit organizations to provide scholarships or sustained supplemental educational services to low-income students who attend, or their siblings who would attend, a public elementary or secondary school due for restructuring for failing to meet state academic performance standards. Requires such scholarships to enable students to attend: (1) the private elementary or secondary school of their parent's choice; or (2) a public elementary or secondary school of their parent's choice outside the student's home school district, consistent with state law. Requires the Secretary to conduct an independent evaluation of this program, including an assessment of its impact on student achievement.</summary>
