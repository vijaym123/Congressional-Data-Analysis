    "text": "Environmental Health Research Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to make grants for the development and operation of not more than six centers to conduct multidisciplinary research on environmental factors that may be related to the development of women's health conditions. Requires each center to conduct basic and clinical research, develop training protocols, conduct training, develop model continuing education programs, and disseminate information to professionals and the public, with priority to prevention activities. Allows a center to use grant funds to provide stipends for health and allied health professionals enrolled in training programs. Requires the Director to establish a comprehensive program to: (1) conduct research on the impact of chemicals that affect the health of women and children through disruption of the hormone system; (2) conduct research on the occurrence of hormone-disrupting chemicals in the environment and their effects on ecological and wildlife health; (3) coordinate the design of a multiagency research initiative on hormone disruption; and (4) coordinate research on hormone disruption in the United States with such research conducted in other nations. Requires the Director to establish the Hormone Disruption Research Interagency Commission to advise the Director of the Institute and the Director of the United States Geological Survey on the development of a comprehensive agenda for conducting research on hormone disruption. Establishes a Hormone Disruption Research Panel to advise the Director of the Institute on the scientific hormone-disruption research program."
