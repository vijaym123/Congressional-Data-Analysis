  <summary>7/26/2005--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide an incidental take permit to a public electric utility that has adopted an avian protection plan, if the Secretary determines that the utility has included in the plan specific measures to mitigate hazards to eagles and other migratory birds. Shields a public utility that receives such an incidental take permit from criminal or civil penalty under specified statutes for the incidental death by electrocution of such birds by a power line during the period the permit is in effect.</summary>
