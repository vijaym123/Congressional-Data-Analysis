Reduces the allowable amount of both the tax deduction and the tax credit based upon taxpayer adjusted gross income levels. Provides for an inflation adjustment for calendar years after 2005 to such adjusted gross income levels. Makes the tax deduction for higher education tuition and related expenses permanent."
