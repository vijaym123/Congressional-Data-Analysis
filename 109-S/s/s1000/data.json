Provides that the amount of such an Award shall be $75,000 for FY2006 (to be adjusted for subsequent fiscal years to reflect increases in the Consumer Price Index) and the term shall not exceed five years. Requires an individual who receives an Award to provide training in hospice care and palliative medicine, which shall constitute at least 75 percent of the obligations of such individual under the terms of the Award."
