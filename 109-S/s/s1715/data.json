Allows any LEA to provide reciprocity for HK-displaced teachers and paraprofessionals.Directs ED to: (1) use the 2004-2005 child count for 2006-2007 funding under ESEA and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) if the LEA serves a school in an HK-disaster area and has a net loss of students; (2) make payments to LEAs to improve instruction of HK-displaced students (if the LEA does not count such students for ESEA and IDEA funding); and (3) assist LEAs serving HK-displaced homeless children and youths.Provides for waiver authority by ED and suspends application of certain student aid requirements under the Higher Education Act of 1965, with respect to HK-affected students or educational institutions, including provisions for: grant assistance repayment, loan deferments, loan limits, work-study, grant uses, and distance education.Directs ED, with respect to HK-affected children with disabilities, to: (1) use 2004-2005 numbers for IDEA funding of sending states; and (2) provide funds to receiving LEAs to provide early intervention services.Directs ED, in reallocating funds under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, to give preference to affected states that contain HK-disaster areas or that received a significant number of individuals from such areas. Allows affected states to apply for waivers of nonfederal share requirements and use reallocated funds for apprenticeship programs for individuals with disabilities to participate in reconstruction or other major disaster assistance activities in areas where they lived on August 22, 2005. Allows affected states to apply to use certain grant funds under the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 to enable HK-affected individuals with disabilities to replace damaged or lost assistive technology devices. Authorizes ED to make grants to enable affected states to carry out such replacement programs. Requires an audit of each ED program that includes HK-related response and recovery activities.
