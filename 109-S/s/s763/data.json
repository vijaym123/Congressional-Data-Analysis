Requires the FRA to: (1) conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine the impact resistance of the steels in the shells of pressure tank cars constructed before 1989; and (2) establish a program to rank the cars according to their risk of catastrophic fracture and separation, and implement measures to eliminate or mitigate such risk."
