    "date": "2006-06-19", 
    "text": "Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 - (Sec. 3) Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) to revise congressional findings under the Act to declare that a number of Regional Fishery Management Councils (Councils) have made progress in integrating ecosystem considerations in fisheries management. Defines \"confidential information,\" \"regional fishery association,\" \"import,\" \"limited access system,\"and \"observer information.\" Replaces, as specified, the term \"individual fishing quota\" with the term \"limited access privilege\" and defines the latter. (Sec. 4) Requires a Council or the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) in managing a fishery under an international fishery agreement to take into account traditional participation of U.S. fishermen in the fishery. (Sec. 5) Declares that allocations of the total allowable level of foreign fishing are discretionary and such allocations shall be zero for fisheries that have adequate or excess harvest capacity. (Sec. 6) Allows funds or contributions received in support of a marine conservation and management plan in a Pacific Insular Area to be deposited in the Western Pacific Sustainable Fisheries Fund. (Currently, the Fund can only receive payments under a Pacific Insular Area fishery agreement allowing fishing in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around a Pacific Insular Area.) Requires funds collected for violations by foreign vessels occurring within the EEZs off Midway Atoll, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Palmyra Atoll, Jarvis, Howland, Baker, and Wake Islands to be deposited into the Western Pacific Sustainable Fisheries Fund. (Sec. 7) Authorizes appropriations for the national fishery management program through FY2012. Title I: Conservation and Management - (Sec. 101) Revises certain fishery conservation and management national standards used to prepare fishery management plans (FMPs) to require such FMPs be consistent with national standards in which: (1) conservation and management measures take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data based on the best scientific information available; and (2) cumulative economic and social impacts of conservation and management measures be included in any fishery impact assessment made for a FMP. (Sec. 102) Extends jurisdiction of the Caribbean Fishery Management Council to the U.S. waters surrounding all U.S. territories in the Caribbean Sea. (Currently, jurisdiction is over fisheries seaward of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.) (Sec. 103) Revises provisions to: (1) authorize the tribal representative on the Pacific Council to appoint an alternate knowledgeable of tribal rights and law and fishery resources during the representative's term; (2) expand the duties of scientific and statistical committees (SSCs) to include peer review of statistical, scientific, and socio-economic information relevant to Council development and the amendment of FMPs, and to provide Councils with ongoing scientific advice for fishery management decisions; (3) require SSC appointees to be experts with strong scientific or technical credentials and experience; (4) authorize a peer review process for each Council for scientific information used to advise the Council about the conservation and management of a fishery; (5) authorize the Secretary to pay a stipend to members of a SSC or an advisory panel who are not employed by the federal government or a state marine fisheries agency; (6) require Councils to develop annual catch limits for each of its fisheries after considering recommendations of its SSC or the peer review process; (7) eliminate the requirement that notice of Council, SSC, and advisory panel meetings be provided in newspapers in major fishing ports of the region (and in other major fishing ports having a direct interest in the affected fishery) and allow such notice by any means that will result in wide publicity in such ports, except that e-mail notification and website postings alone are not sufficient; (8) require the Secretary to develop a training course in a variety of topics related to fishery management for newly appointed Council members; (9) authorize the establishment of Council coordination committees; (10) require financial interest disclosures of Council members be made available on the Internet; and (11) establish guidelines for state governors and the Secretary to nominate and appoint voting members to the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council. (Sec. 104) Amends FMP requirements to: (1) set forth certain additional information to be submitted and considered in the preparation of FMPs, including fish processors and economic and fishery impacts information; (2) allocate harvest restrictions or recovery benefits fairly and equitably among the commercial, recreational, and charter fishing sectors in a fishery, taking into consideration the economic impact of such restrictions or benefits on fishery participants in each of the sectors in the fishery; and (3) require FMPs to provide a mechanism setting annual catch limits. (Sec. 105) Amends discretionary FMP provisions to authorize FMPs to: (1) designate as protected areas deep sea corals that have been identified as essential fish habitats in order to protect them from physical damage from fishing gear or to prevent loss or damage to such fishing gear from the deep sea coral, after considering long-term sustainable uses of fishery resources in such areas; (2) ensure that closures of fisheries to fishing activity are based on the best scientific information available, include criteria to assess the conservation benefit of the closed area, establish a timetable for review of the closure's performance, and are based on an assessment of the benefits and impacts of the closures; (3) incorporate the relevant fishery and take into account the different circumstances affecting fisheries from different states and ports, including distances to fishing grounds and proximity to time and area closures; (4) establish a limited access system for a fishery in order to achieve optimum yield; (5) establish a process for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); and (6) include management measures that consider a variety of ecological factors affecting fishery populations,including the conservation of target and non-target species and habitats. (Sec. 106) Authorizes a Council to establish with the Secretary's approval (or on its own initiative through a FMP or amendment or in response to a petition of a group of fishermen certified by the Secretary) a limited access privilege program (LAPP) to harvest fish from a fishery that is managed under a limited access system, provided certain requirements are met. Includes within the LAPP the limited access privilege, quota share, or other limited access system programs which: (1) shall be considered a permit that allows a person or entity (including fishing communities or regional fishery associations) to harvest fish in a fishery; and (2) may be revoked, limited, or modified. Directs the Secretary to work with the Small Business Administration (SBA) and other federal agencies to develop incentives for U.S. investment in U.S. seafood processing facilities for fisheries that lack U.S.-based facilities. (Sec. 107) Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Councils and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), to revise and update agency procedures which shall be used by the Councils and CEQ as the sole environmental impact assessment procedure for FMP compliance with the NEPA. (Sec. 108) Extends the period during which an emergency amendment or interim measure to an FMP may remain in effect or that can be extended for an additional period. (Sec. 109) Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program for regionally-based marine education and training programs in the Western Pacific. (Sec. 110) Revises eligibility requirements for the Western Alaska community development quota program (under which a percentage of the total allowable catch of any Bering Sea fishery is allocated to a community) to authorize a community participating in the program to continue in such program if it was: (1) listed in certain National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) regulations in effect on January 1, 2004; or approved by the NMFS on April 19, 1999. (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary to determine whether fishing for regulated species within state waters of the New England multi-species complex without a New England multi-species groundfish fishery permit is consistent with the federal FMP. Requires the Secretary, upon determination that such fishing activity in state waters is inconsistent with the federal FMP, to notify the state and develop and implement measures to cure the inconsistency. (Sec. 112) Authorizes any maritime enforcement officer of the Secretary, or the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, to access any data or information required to be provided under maritime law, including data from Global Maritime Distress and Safety Systems (GMDSS), vessel monitoring systems, or other similar system. Subjects such information to certain confidentiality requirements. Authorizes a governor of a state to apply to the Secretary for a joint enforcement agreement (JEA) with the Secretary authorizing the deputization and funding of state marine law enforcement officers to carry out marine law enforcement responsibilities of the Secretary. Directs the NMFS and the U.S. Coast Guard to report jointly to Congress on the use of the GMDSS and similar systems for purposes of fishery management, conservation, enforcement, and safety. (Sec. 113) Includes regulatory restrictions imposed to protect human health or the marine environment (including those imposed as a result of judicial action) among the causes of a commercial fishery failure that could qualify a community for disaster relief. Reauthorizes the disaster relief program through FY2012. Makes specified changes to the fishing capacity reduction program, including to: (1) authorize a majority of permit holders in a fishery to conduct a voluntary fishing capacity reduction program (currently, only a Council or state may request the Secretary to initiate such a program); and (2) allow the Secretary to conduct a referendum on establishing an industry fee system to fund a capacity reduction program without the request of the Councils ( current law requires Council action). Revises requirements for implementing a voluntary capacity reduction program. (Sec. 114) Authorizes the Secretary, upon the request of a state Governor, to establish a regional economic transition program to provide disaster relief to fishermen, charter fishing operators, U.S. fish processors, and owners of related fishery infrastructure affected by a catastrophic regional fishery disaster. Directs the Secretary to complete a recovery plan for Klamath River Coho salmon and make it available to the public. Requires the Secretary to report annually to Congress with respect to such plan. Makes federally-recognized Indian tribes and small businesses (including fishermen, fish processors, and related businesses serving the fishing industry) which are adversely affected by federal closures and fishing restrictions in the Oregon and California 2006 fall Chinook salmon fishery eligible for direct fisheries disaster assistance and commercial fishermen disaster assistance. (Sec. 115) Directs the Secretary to provide deferred payment and loan forgiveness assistance to holders of fishery finance program (FFP) loans who were affected by Hurricanes Katrina or Rita. Authorizes appropriations through FY2012. (Sec. 116) Directs the Secretary to establish a shrimp fisheries hurricane assistance program for the Gulf of Mexico. Requires the Secretary to allocate program funds (based a certain formula) among the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Texas for marketing, seafood testing programs, development of limited access programs, bycatch reduction, capacity reduction, and individual and small business personal assistance. Authorizes appropriations through FY2011. (Sec. 117) Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with Councils and other interests and based upon the best scientific information available, to establish a bycatch reduction program to develop technological devices and other conservation engineering changes designed to minimize bycatch, seabird bycatch, bycatch mortality, and post-release mortality in federally managed fisheries. Authorizes FMPs to establish incentives to reduce total bycatch and seabird bycatch amounts, bycatch rates, and post-release mortality in fisheries. Authorizes the Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Interior, to undertake projects in cooperation with industry to improve information and technology to reduce seabird bycatch. (Sec. 118) Directs the Secretary to establish a community-based fishery and coastal habitat restoration program to implement and support the restoration of fishery and coastal habitats. (Sec. 119) Amends certain prohibitions to make it unlawful for any person to: (1) import, export, transport, sell, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce fish taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of foreign law or regulation; and (2) use a fishing vessel that has been removed from a fishery through the fishing capacity reduction program to fish in federal or state waters (or on the high seas or the waters of another country). (Sec. 120) Increases the maximum civil penalty for violations under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Provides that the transfer of ownership of a vessel permit (or interest in such permit) shall not extinguish any permit sanction that is in effect at the time of the transfer. Requires the Secretary to reinstate a permit that has been seized upon the settlement of the civil forfeiture. Increases the maximum criminal penalty for non-violent violations of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Removes the civil penalty ($200,000), but keeps the penalty of up to 10 years' imprisonment for aggravated criminal offenses. Extends criminal liability to a person who commits an aggravated offense against a Council member. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for knowing violations under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Grants U.S. district courts jurisdiction over actions arising under the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
