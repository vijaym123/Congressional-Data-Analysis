  <summary>10/6/2005--Introduced.
Medicaid Health Opportunity Account Act of 2005 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a demonstration program under which states may provide alternative benefits, including health opportunity accounts, for eligible population groups in one or more geographic areas. Prohibits the Secretary from approving a state demonstration program unless it provides for transactions involving health opportunity accounts to be conducted electronically and without cash. Limits contributions into a health opportunity account to those by: (1) the state under Medicaid; and (2) other persons and entities, such as charitable organizations. Requires a state to specify the contribution amount that shall be deposited into a health opportunity account. Allows a state to: (1) impose limitations on the maximum contributions that may be deposited into a health opportunity account in a year; and (2) limit contributions into such an account once the balance reaches a specified level. Prohibits a state from contributing annually to a health opportunity account, on behalf of an individual or family, more than $2,500 per adult and $1,000 per child. Allows the use of amounts in a health opportunity account for payment of such health care expenditures as the state specifies.</summary>
