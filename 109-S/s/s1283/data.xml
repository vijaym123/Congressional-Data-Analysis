  <summary>6/21/2005--Introduced.
Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants or cooperative agreements to a recommended agency, organization, or political subdivision to develop respite care programs at the state or local level or to evaluate the effectiveness of such care. Defines "respite care" to mean planned or emergency care provided to a child or adult with a special need in order to provide temporary relief to the family caregiver. Instructs the Secretary to work cooperatively with existing federal respite program officers to ensure coordination of services for family caregivers. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a review panel to make recommendations on applicants; and (2) give priority to applicants with the greatest likelihood of implementing or enhancing lifespan respite care statewide. Permits the use of funds for respite care services and training programs for volunteers and family caregivers. Limits grants to five years. Directs the Secretary to award a grant or cooperative agreement to a public or private nonprofit entity to establish the National Resource Center on Lifespan Respite Care to: (1) maintain a national database on lifespan respite care; (2) provide training and technical assistance to state, community, and nonprofit respite care programs; and (3) provide information, referral, and educational programs to the public on lifespan respite care.</summary>
