Congressional Commission on the Abolition of Modern-day Slavery Act - Defines "modern-day slavery." Establishes a congressional Commission on the Abolition of Modern-day Slavery which shall: (1) study matters relating to modern-day slavery, including vulnerabilities of commonly affected populations; (2) study the roles of the rule of law, lack of enforcement, and corruption within international law enforcement institutions that allow the proliferation of modern-day slavery; (3) review relevant governmental programs; and (4) convene additional experts from nongovernmental organizations as part of the Commission's review. States that the Commission shall seek to promote goals of: (1) providing a comprehensive evaluation of best practices to prevent modern-day slavery, to rescue and rehabilitate its victims, and to prosecute traffickers and increase accountability within countries; (2) identifying countries which provide the greatest opportunity for abolition of modern-day slavery specific to U.S. involvement; (3) examining the economic impact on communities and countries that demonstrate measured success in fighting modern-day slavery; and (4) increasing education and awareness about modern-day slavery.</summary>
