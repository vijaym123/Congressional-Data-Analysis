States that the Commission shall seek to promote goals of: (1) providing a comprehensive evaluation of best practices to prevent modern-day slavery, to rescue and rehabilitate its victims, and to prosecute traffickers and increase accountability within countries; (2) identifying countries which provide the greatest opportunity for abolition of modern-day slavery specific to U.S. involvement; (3) examining the economic impact on communities and countries that demonstrate measured success in fighting modern-day slavery; and (4) increasing education and awareness about modern-day slavery."
