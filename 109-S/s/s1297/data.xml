  <summary>6/23/2005--Introduced.
Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of 2005 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require a participating hospital that uses the services of postgraduate trainees to limit their working hours to specified schedules. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations to monitor and supervise postgraduate trainees assigned patient care responsibilities as part of an approved medical training program, as well as to assure patient quality care. Prescribes whistleblower protections for employees who in good faith report violations of working hour limits. Makes appropriations to the Secretary to provide for additional payments to hospitals for their reasonable additional, incremental costs of compliance with this Act.</summary>
