  <summary>7/27/2005--Introduced.
Small Business Economic Impact Analysis Act of 2005 - Prohibits an agency from making a qualified termination or restructuring (a termination of the use of a facility or restructuring that will result in the net loss of at least 1,000 jobs in a state) unless it conducts a detailed analysis of the impact on small businesses and small governmental jurisdictions of the proposed termination or restructuring. Requires: (1) a related cost-benefit analysis; and (2) the agency to publish a draft of the analysis at least 180 days before undertaking the termination or restructuring. Directs the: (1) agency to publish a final economic analysis; and (2) Comptroller General to review such final analysis. Prohibits an agency from taking final action on a termination or restructuring until its analysis receives a satisfactory review from the Comptroller General. Authorizes judicial review for any small business or small governmental jurisdiction adversely affected or aggrieved by a qualifying termination or restructuring.</summary>
