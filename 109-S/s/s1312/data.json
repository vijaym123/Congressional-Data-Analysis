Limits these additional employment rights of a former U.S. officer or employee employed by an Indian tribe to any former U.S. officer or employee who is a tribal employee or an elected or appointed official of an Indian tribe carrying out an official duty. Defines tribal employee as an individual acting under the day-to-day control or supervision of the Indian tribal government, unaffected by the control or supervision of any independent contractor, agency or organization, or intervening sovereignty. Repeals the specific authority of such current or former U.S. officers or employees to act as agents or attorneys for or to appear on behalf of such tribes in connection with any matter pending before any department, agency, court, or commission. Authorizes such individuals, however, to communicate with and appear before any such department, agency, court, or commission on behalf of the Indian tribe on any matter (including, as currently, any matter in which the United States is a party or has direct and substantial interest). Revises requirements for notification by a former U.S. officer or employee of any personal and substantial involvement the individual may have had as a U.S. officer or employee with respect to the pending matter."
