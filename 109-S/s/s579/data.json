Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct initial pilot projects to supplement and inform the panel's work. Requires the Director to develop and implement a program that funds additional research determined to be necessary by the panel concerning the role and impact of electronic media in the development of children and adolescents, with a particular focus on media content, format, length of exposure, age of the child or adolescent, and nature of parental involvement."
