    "text": "Bolster Our Energy Security for Tomorrow Act - Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), upon state request, to provide financial assistance to facilitate hiring additional personnel with expertise in fields relevant to consideration of federal refinery authorizations. Directs a federal agency responsible for federal refinery authorization, upon state request, to provide technical, legal, or other nonfinancial assistance to facilitate such consideration. Directs the President to: (1) appoint a federal coordinator to coordinate refinery authorization procedures; and (2) designate at least three closed military installations, or portions of them, as potentially suitable for the construction of a refinery. Requires that at least one such site be designated as potentially suitable for construction of a biomass refinery. Requires the appropriate redevelopment authority to consider the feasibility and practicability of siting a refinery on the closed military installation when preparing or revising the redevelopment plan for it. Prescribes guidelines for the management and disposal of real property. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal its refinery revitalization authority."
