  <summary>9/29/2006--Introduced.
Iran Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 2006 - States that it should be U.S. policy to neither negotiate nor seek to bring into force an agreement for cooperation with the government of any country that is assisting Iran's nuclear program or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles to Iran unless the President has made specified determinations under this Act. States that no agreement for cooperation between the United States and the government of any country that is assisting Iran's nuclear program or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles to Iran may be submitted to the President or to Congress pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, no such agreement may enter into force with such country, no export license may be issued to such country for any nuclear material, facilities, components, or other goods, services, or technology that would be subject to such agreement, and no approval may be given for the transfer or retransfer to such country of any nuclear material, facilities, components, or other goods, services, or technology that would be subject to such agreement, until the President determines and reports to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on International Relations that: (1) Iran has suspended all enrichment-related and reprocessing-related activity, has committed to verifiably refrain permanently from such activity, and is abiding by that commitment; or (2) the government of the country that is assisting Iran's nuclear program or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles to Iran has suspended all nuclear assistance to Iran and all transfers of advanced conventional weapons and missiles to Iran, and is committed to maintaining that suspension until Iran has implemented measures that would permit the President to make such determination.</summary>
