  <summary>6/28/2006--Introduced.
Secure Nuclear Facilities Act of 2006 - Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to award competitive grants to any state in which a nuclear power plant is located, and to local governments, local law enforcement agencies, local fire departments, and hospitals that are located within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant. Requires the use of such funds: (1) to assist in purchasing or improving communication systems to allow for real-time, interoperable communication between sate and local first responders and nuclear power plant representatives; or (2) for expenditures to improve the ability of communities to facilitate evacuations and provide medical treatment in the event of an emergency at a nuclear power plant. Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to promulgate regulations requiring all nuclear power plants to comply with a certain design basis threat level under the Code of Federal Regulations, applicable to facilities designated by the Secretary as Threat Level 1(b) facilities.</summary>
