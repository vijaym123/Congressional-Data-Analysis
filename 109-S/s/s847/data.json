Declares that from the date of enactment of this Act until 30 days afterward: (1) deliveries of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) shall be suspended; and (2) one million barrels of oil per day shall be released from the SPR. Provides for the release of one million barrels of oil per day from the SPR for an additional 30 days if it is necessary to: (1) lower the burden of gasoline prices on the domestic economy; and (2) circumvent OPEC efforts to reap windfall crude oil profits."
