Terminates a 45-month limit on the use of survivors' and dependents' educational assistance. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide special restorative training to certain individuals. Increases the amount of basic educational assistance for veterans' survivors and dependents pursuing certain types of institutional education. Authorizes the provision of tutorial assistance to such individuals without charge to their educational assistance entitlement."
