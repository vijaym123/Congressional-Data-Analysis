Directs the Council to: (1) manage and oversee the implementation of a system-wide, comprehensive plan for Corps of Engineers projects that addresses hurricane protection, flood control, coastal and ecosystem restoration, storm surge damage reduction, or navigation in any area along the Louisiana coast in which a major disaster relating to Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita was declared by the President on or after August 29, 2005, in accordance with the comprehensive hurricane protection program authorized by Congress during 2005; (2) establish and carry out a 20-year demonstration program for the study, design, integrated implementation, and system-wide management of any project or component of a Corps project in such disaster area; and (3) develop recommendations for an emergency strategy to repair infrastructure relating to projects under the plan and to supplement the Corps' authority in any Louisiana area affected by a major disaster or emergency declared by the President to exist during the demonstration program period. Requires each Corps' study in the disaster area authorized during the period of such program to be conducted in accordance with it.
