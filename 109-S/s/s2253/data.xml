Instructs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Mineral Management Service, to offer the 181 Area of the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas leasing within one year after enactment of this Act. Prohibits the Secretary from offering for oil and gas leasing: (1) any area east of the Military Mission Line, unless the Secretary of Defense agrees in writing before the area is offered for lease that it can be developed in a manner that will not interfere with military activities; or (2) any area within 100 miles of the coastline of Florida. States that the 181 Area shall be offered for lease even though it is omitted from any outer Continental Shelf leasing program under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</summary>
