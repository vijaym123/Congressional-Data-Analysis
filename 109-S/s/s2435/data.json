Urges the President to place on the agenda for discussion at the Governing Board of the International Energy Agency the merits of establishing an international energy program application procedure. Urges the Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum (established in response to this Act) to implement: (1) an Energy Crisis Initiative; (2) an Energy Sustainability Initiative; and (3) an Energy for Development Initiative.
