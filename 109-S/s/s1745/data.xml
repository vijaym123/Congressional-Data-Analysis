  <summary>9/21/2005--Introduced.
Community Services Disaster Assistance Act of 2005 - Provides that a state that receives a payment or allotment under the Community Services Block Grant Act (CSBGA) may use not more than 1% of the portion of the block grant payment or allotment available for expenditure to transfer funds to Louisana, Mississippi, or Alabama. Requires a state that receives such funds to use them to make community services grants, or carry out related activities. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive income limitations on eligibility to receive CSBGA assistance for any area in which the President has determined that an emerency, or a major disaster exists, related to Hurricane Katrina, for the purpose of assisting individuals who resided in such an area on August 22, 2005. Provides that an eligible entity or a state lead agency may send an employee who receives compensation under CSBGA to such an area to provide disaster assistance. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) federal law permits the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to utilize eligible entities to provide emergency assistance under CSBGA; and (2) FEMA should make this emergency assistance available to such entities immediately.</summary>
