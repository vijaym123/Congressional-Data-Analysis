  <summary>8/3/2006--Introduced.
Tanning Accountability and Notification Act of 2006 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to determine whether: (1) the labeling requirements for indoor tanning devices provide sufficient information to consumers regarding the risks that the use of such devices pose for the development of irreversible damage to the eyes and skin, including skin cancer; and (2) an additional warning would communicate such risks more effectively; or (3) there is no warning that would adequately communicate such risks. Requires the Secretary, in making such determinations, to: (1) conduct consumer testing using the best available methods for determining consumer understanding of label warnings; and (2) hold public hearings and solicit public comments.</summary>
