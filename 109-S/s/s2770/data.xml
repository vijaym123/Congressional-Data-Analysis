  <summary>5/9/2006--Introduced.
Andijan Accountability Act of 2006 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the government of Uzbekistan's repressive policies undermine U.S. efforts to promote stability and combat terrorism and extremism in Central Asia, and that the United States has a strong interest in promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Uzbekistan. Directs the President to provide the appropriate congressional committees with a list of officials of the government of Uzbekistan, including any current or former officials of the security services and judicial institutions, who played a substantial role in the repression of peaceful political dissent, and a list of any other Uzbek individuals who provide substantial economic and political support for the present Uzbekistan leadership. Imposes the following sanctions on such listed individuals and their immediate family members: (1) U.S. visa ineligibility; (2) prohibition on transfers of property or property interests in the United States or within the possession or control of a U.S. person; and (3) prohibition on financial transactions with a U.S. person. Authorizes the President to terminate sanctions if the Secretary of State certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the government of Uzbekistan is fully cooperating with an independent international inquiry into the 2005 Andijan massacre.</summary>
