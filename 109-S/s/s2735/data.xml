Dam Safety Act of 2006 - Amends the National Dam Safety Program Act to require (currently, authorizes) the Secretary of the Army to maintain and update information on the inventory of dams in the United States, including any available information assessing each dam based on inspections completed by either a federal agency or a state dam safety agency. Requires the strategic plan for dam safety prepared by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish performance measures, in addition to goals, priorities, and target dates, toward effectively administering the Act to improve dam safety. Requires a state dam safety program, to be eligible for assistance under such Act, to include: (1) the authority to require or perform periodic evaluations of all dams and reservoirs to the extent of the threat to human life and property in case of failure; and (2) the authority to issue notices to require owners of dams to install and monitor instrumentation. Reauthorizes appropriations for the National Dam Safety Program, the National Dam Inventory, research, training, and staff.</summary>
