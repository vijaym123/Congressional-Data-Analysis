Defines a \"sexual offender\" as an offender 18 years of age or older who commits a sexual offense against a minor. Directs the Attorney General to ensure that each state with eligible programs receives a proportional share of funding based on the total number of eligible states and the population of sex offenders to be monitored with global positioning systems in those states."
