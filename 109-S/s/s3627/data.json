Prohibits the export of elemental mercury from the United States, effective on January 1, 2010, and authorizes the President to prohibit the export of any mercury compound as necessary to achieve the full force and effect of such elemental mercury export ban. Requires the President to establish the capacity (including storage facilities) to safely store covered mercury and mercury compounds in excess of quantities necessary for domestic consumption."
