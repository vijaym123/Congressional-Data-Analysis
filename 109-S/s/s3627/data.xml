Mercury Market Minimization Act of 2006 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy from conveying, selling, distributing, or otherwise transferring elemental mercury. Exempts the transfer of elemental mercury to any storage or other facility established pursuant to this Act. Prohibits the export of elemental mercury from the United States, effective on January 1, 2010, and authorizes the President to prohibit the export of any mercury compound as necessary to achieve the full force and effect of such elemental mercury export ban. Requires the President to establish the capacity (including storage facilities) to safely store covered mercury and mercury compounds in excess of quantities necessary for domestic consumption.</summary>
