Allows residents in other counties in Montana to apply for compensation and requires the National Cancer Institute to evaluate eligibility on a case-by-case basis for such applicants. Allows eligible individuals to receive additional compensation for the costs of screening, complications of screening, follow-up referrals, work-up diagnosis, and treatment related to the specific disease contracted by the individual. Requires the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to conduct a program of education and communication about the health risks posed by radiation exposure from fallout from U.S. nuclear weapons testing."
