Removes two-parent families from the formula for such limitation. Creates an exception to the limitation for education in preparation for sector-specific, high-skill occupations to meet employer demand. Defines sector-specific, high-demand, high-skill occupation to meet employer demand as an occupation that: (1) has been identified by the state workforce investment board or by the state agency administering the state TANF program as within state needs with regard to current and projected employment opportunities in specific industry sectors; (2) requires occupational training; and (3) provides a wage of at least 75 percent of the state median hourly wage."
