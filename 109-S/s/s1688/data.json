    "text": "Hurricane Katrina Medicaid and SCHIP Relief Act of 2005 - Provides that, during the Hurricane Katrina disaster period, any affected state may provide medical assistance, under a state Medicaid plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act (SSA), without submitting a state plan amendment, to an adult Katrina Survivor, or to a child Katrina Survivor, under SSA title XXI (State Child Health Insurance Program) (SCHIP). Applies to the area of residence (or former residence) of a Katrina Survivor a federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) during the disaster period of 100% for Medicaid or SCHIP assistance provided, and costs directly attributable to all related administrative activities. Excludes the disaster relief period in computing the Medicare part B late enrollment penalty. Extends the initial enrollment period for prescription drug plans under Medicare part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) to at least May 15, 2007. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish premium and cost-sharing documentation rules for Katrina Survivors which take into account the loss and unavailability of documents due to Hurricane Katrina. Requires the Secretary to post on the Internet website for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services a list of declared disaster areas, including parishes and counties, resulting from Hurricane Katrina. Designates the provisions of this Act as emergency requirements exempt from certain budget constraints under H.C. Res. 95 (109th Congress)."
