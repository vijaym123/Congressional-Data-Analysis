  <summary>9/6/2006--Introduced.
Federal Employees Electronic Personal Health Records Act of 2006 - Amends federal civil service law to require each contract between the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and a qualified carrier offering a health benefit plan for federal employees to provide for establishment and maintenance of electronic personal health records for each individual and family member enrolled in the plan. Requires such records to be: (1) in a standard electronic format, available for electronic access through the Internet; and (2) based on the federal messaging and health vocabulary standards developed by the Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, the American Health Information Community, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Directs OPM to ensure that each individual and family member is given an opportunity to elect at any time to opt out of participation in the record program or terminate an established record.</summary>
