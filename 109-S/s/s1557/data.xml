  <summary>7/29/2005--Introduced.
Respect for Life Pluripotent Stem Cell Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to provide for the conduct and support of basic and applied research in isolating, deriving, and using pluripotent stems cells without creating or harming human embryos. Provides that such research may include: (1) research in animals to develop and test techniques for deriving cells from embryos without doing harm to embryos; (2) research to develop and test techniques for producing human pluripotent stems cells without creating or making use of embryos; and (3) research to isolate, develop, and test pluripotent stem cells from postnatal tissues, umbilical cord blood, and placenta. Prohibits research under this Act that: (1) involves the use of human embryos; (2) involves the use of stem cells not otherwise eligible for NIH funds; (3) involves the use of any stem cell to create or to attempt to create a human embryo; or (4) poses a significant risk of creating a human embryo by any means.</summary>
