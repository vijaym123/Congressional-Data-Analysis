    "text": "Restore Scientific Integrity to Federal Research and Policymaking Act - Prohibits a federal employee from engaging in: (1) tampering with the conduct of federally funded scientific research or analysis; (2) censorship of findings of such research or analysis; or (3) directing the dissemination of scientific information known by the directing employee to be false or misleading. Sets forth a penalty for violations of such prohibition. Includes under prohibited personnel practices the taking or failing to take, or threatening to take or failing to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee because of: (1) the development or dissemination, within the scope of employment, of scientific research or analysis that the employee reasonably believes to be accurate and valid; (2) any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences an abuse of authority, including but not limited to, tampering with the conduct of federally funded scientific research or analysis, censoring the findings of such research or analysis, or directing the dissemination of scientific information known by the directing employee to be false or misleading. Sets forth requirements relating to federal scientific advisory committees. States that all appointments to such committees shall be made without regard to political affiliation, unless required by federal statute. Directs each federal agency to determine a peer review process that is appropriate for the agency's functions and needs. Prohibits \"The Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review\", issued on December 16, 2004, from applying to any agency that has established its own peer review process. Prohibits the Office of Management and Budget from taking any action to discourage an agency from determining and establishing a peer-review process appropriate for its needs. Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to provide annual reports regarding scientific integrity."
