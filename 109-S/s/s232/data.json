    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, directly or through financial assistance to non-federal parties, to plan, design, and construct fish passage and screening facilities or habitat improvements at any non-federal water diversion or storage project located anywhere in the Columbia River Basin. Provides such authority when the Secretary determines that such facilities would enable the Bureau to meet its obligations for the construction, operation, and maintenance of federal reclamation projects in the Columbia River Basin, excluding the projects located in the Snake River Basin. Limits the federal share to 75% of project costs. Authorizes the Secretary to assist a non-federal party who owns, operates, or maintains a non-federal water diversion or storage project and associated lands to obtain and comply with any required state, local, or tribal permits. Makes the Secretary subject to all federal laws applicable to activities associated with the construction of a fish passage and screening facility or habitat improvements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) comply with any applicable state water laws; and (2) coordinate with the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, appropriate agencies of the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, and appropriate federally recognized Indian tribes in carrying out the program authorized by this Act. Makes the Reclamation Act of 1902 and other federal reclamation laws inapplicable to the non-federal water projects at which the fish passage and screening facilities authorized by this Act are located and the lands such projects irrigate. Declares that expenditures made by the Secretary under this Act shall not be a project cost assignable to any federal reclamation project and shall be non-reimbursable and non-returnable to the Treasury."
