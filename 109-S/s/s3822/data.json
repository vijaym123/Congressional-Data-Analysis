Provides for the recruitment of health professionals from diverse backgrounds in the genomics workforce and improvement in the quality of genomics training. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a tax credit for qualified research expenses for the development of a qualified companion diagnostic test designed to provide information to increase the safety or effectiveness of a drug. Provides for the expansion of adverse event reporting systems to encompass reports of adverse events resulting from genetic testing."
