    "text": "Summer Operations and Seasonal Equity Act of 2005 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require that no less than 12,000 of the total H-2B visas (temporary nonagricultural workers) available for any fiscal year (currently, up to 66,000) must be made available in each quarter of such year. States that an alien counted toward the numerical limitations applicable to such visas within the three years prior to the approval of a petition for an H-2B temporary worker shall not be counted again toward such limitations. Makes this provision effective as if enacted on October 1, 2004. Provides for its expiration on October 1, 2007. Amends the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate information regarding: (1) the numbers of aliens granted H-2B status or terminated from H-2B status, on a quarterly basis; and (2) the countries of origin, occupations of, and compensation paid to aliens granted H-2B status, the number of aliens terminated from such status, and the number of aliens provided such status during both the fiscal year reported and the preceding fiscal year, on an annual basis."
