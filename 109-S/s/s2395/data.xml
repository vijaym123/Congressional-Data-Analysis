  <summary>3/9/2006--Introduced.
Directs the U.S. Postal Service, in the exercise of its authority to contract with an air carrier for the transportation of mail by aircraft, to require an air carrier to accept as mail shipments of live animals that postal regulations allow to be transmitted as mail. Requires an air carrier to accept and carry such cargo when the outside temperature is between 0 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit from the point of origin through the point of destination. Applies the authority of the Postal Service under this Act to any air carrier that commonly and regularly carries live animals as cargo.</summary>
