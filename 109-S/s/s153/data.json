Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct and submit a report to specified congressional committees on a resource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in California to evaluate various alternatives for protecting the Corridor's resources, including designating all or part of the Corridor as a unit of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Lists the objectives the Secretary shall seek to achieve in conducting the study. Requires the Secretary to analyze: (1) the potential impact of each alternative on staffing and other potential costs to Federal, State, and local agencies and other organizations; and (2) the potential impact that designating all or part of the Rim of the Valley Corridor as a unit of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area would have on land in or bordering the area that is privately owned as of the date on which the study is conducted. Requires the report to include the concerns of private landowners within the boundaries of the Recreation Area."
