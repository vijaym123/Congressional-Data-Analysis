  <summary>9/27/2006--Introduced.
Community Protection Against International Gangs Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make an alien inadmissible or deportable (provides the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General with waiver authority) if the Attorney General or the Secretary (or a consular officer regarding inadmissibility) knows or has reason to believe that such alien: (1) is or has been a member of a criminal street gang; or (2) has participated in a criminal street gang's activities, knowing or having reason to know that such activities furthered the criminal gang's illegal activity. Authorizes the Secretary to instruct the Department of State to deny visas to individuals from a country that has denied or unreasonably delayed acceptance of a citizen, national, or resident of that country who has been ordered removed from United States until the country accepts such individual.</summary>
