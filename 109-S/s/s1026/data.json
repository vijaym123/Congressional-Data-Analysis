    "text": "Stewardship for Our Coasts and Opportunities for Reliable Energy Act - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer certain Outer Continental Shelf revenues deposited in the Treasury to the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to make payments to producing states and coastal political subdivisions. Sets forth disbursement and allocation guidelines, including requirements for payments to coastal political subdivisions. Requires the Governor of a producing state to submit a coastal impact assistance plan to the Secretary by July 1, 2008. Directs the Secretary to delineate the lateral boundaries between coastal states in areas of the outer Continental Shelf under exclusive federal jurisdiction, to the extent of the exclusive economic zone of the United States, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 10, 1982. Prescribes expedited petition and approval procedures under which the Governor of a state whose seaward lateral boundaries have been delineated as restricted for leasing may petition the Secretary for a resource assessment, if the leasing is for: (1) oil and gas leasing; (2) gas-only leasing; or (3) any other energy source leasing, including renewable energy leasing. Authorizes the Secretary to grant a lease, easement, or right-of-way on the outer Continental Shelf for activities not otherwise authorized under existing law if those activities: (1) support exploration, development, production, transportation, or storage of oil, natural gas, or other minerals; (2) produce or support production, transportation, or transmission of energy from sources other than oil and gas; or (3) use, for energy-related or marine-related purposes, facilities in use on or before the date of enactment of this Act for activities authorized under this Act."
