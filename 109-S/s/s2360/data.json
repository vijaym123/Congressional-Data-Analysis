    "text": "Internet Non-Discrimination Act of 2006 - Prohibits a network operator (an entity that owns, controls, or resells any facility that provides communications services to subscribers) from, among other things: (1) interfering with any bits, content, application, or service transmitted over the operator's network; (2) discriminating in allocating bandwidth and transmitting content, applications, or services to or from a subscriber; or (3) assessing a charge to any application or service provider not on the operator's network for the delivery of traffic to any subscriber to the operator's network. Preserves authority of network operators to: (1) protect subscribers from adware, viruses, spam, content deemed inappropriate for minors, and other applications or service that harms the Internet experience of subscribers; and (2) support an application or service intended to prevent such adware, viruses, content, etc. Allows an aggrieved party to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with respect to alleged network operator violations of such requirements. Provides deadlines with respect to complaint consideration and rulings. Provides violator penalties."
