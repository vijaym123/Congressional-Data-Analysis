    "text": "Chemical Security and Safety Act of 2006 - Establishes a general duty by each owner and operator of a stationary source (as defined under the Clean Air Act) that produces, processes, handles, or stores any substance of concern to: (1) identify hazards that may result from a criminal release; (2) take necessary actions to prevent criminal releases; and (3) eliminate or significantly reduce the consequences of any such release. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to promulgate regulations to: (1) designate certain stationary sources and substances of concern as high priority; and (2) require each owner or operator of a high priority stationary source to detect, prevent, and eliminate or significantly reduce the consequences of criminal releases that may harm public health or safety. Requires each such owner or operator to: (1) report to the Secretary with a vulnerability assessment and a prevention, preparedness, and response plan; (2) establish a safety and security committee for that source if it has 15 or more full-time equivalent employees; and (3) annually provide each employee with four hours of training regarding requirements of this Act. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a program to conduct regular inspections of stationary sources. Authorizes the Secretary to issue orders directing compliance with this Act and sets penalties for noncompliance. Requires the Secretary and the Administrator to promulgate regulations requiring high priority stationary sources to participate in emergency preparedness exercises. Directs the Secretary to establish an information clearinghouse to assist stationary sources in complying with this Act. Prohibits discrimination against employees who disclose violations of this Act or threats to public health or safety relating to chemical security or improper releases."
