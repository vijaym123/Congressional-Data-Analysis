Prohibits the Secretary from offering for oil and gas leasing: (1) any area east of the Military Mission Line, unless the Secretary of Defense agrees in writing before the area is offered for lease that it can be developed in a manner that will not interfere with military activities; or (2) any area that is within 100 miles of the coastline of Florida. Requires the 181 Area to be offered for lease in spite of its omission from a specified leasing program under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Requires the Secretary, without further appropriation, to disburse to producing states and coastal political subdivisions, 50% of the qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues generated from leases from the 181 Area during each fiscal year. Prescribes guidelines for allocation and authorized uses consistent with the coastal impact assistance program under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act."
