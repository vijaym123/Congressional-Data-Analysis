Tasks each commission with reaching a consensus among statewide education stakeholders on the skills, knowledge, and patterns of coursework needed to successfully transition to and complete postsecondary education. Requires that state-level longitudinal P-16 data systems track the academic performance of each student so that the factors which correlate with such success may be identified and publicized."
