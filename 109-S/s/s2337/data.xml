  <summary>2/28/2006--Introduced.
College Pathway Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to states to establish preschool through postsecondary (P-16) education stewardship commissions or systems consisting of such commissions and P-16 education data systems. Tasks each commission with reaching a consensus among statewide education stakeholders on the skills, knowledge, and patterns of coursework needed to successfully transition to and complete postsecondary education. Requires that state-level longitudinal P-16 data systems track the academic performance of each student so that the factors which correlate with such success may be identified and publicized.</summary>
