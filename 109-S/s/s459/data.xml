  <summary>2/18/2005--Introduced.
Interstate 3/3rd Infantry Division Highway Initiation Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) a new interstate highway designated as "United States Interstate Route 3" should be constructed between Savannah, Georgia, and Knoxville, Tennessee; and (2) such highway should be known and designated as the "3rd Infantry Division Highway", in honor of the professionalism, heroism, and sacrifice of the men and women of the U.S. Army 3rd Division in defending the freedom of the United States. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study and report to the appropriate congressional committees on the steps and estimated funding necessary to designate and construct a new interstate route for the 3rd Infantry Division Highway, between Savannah, Georgia, and Knoxville, Tennessee (formerly the Savannah River Parkway in the State of Georgia).</summary>
