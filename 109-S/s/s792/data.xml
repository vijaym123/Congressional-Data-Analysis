Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Database Act of 2005 or Dru's Law - (Sec. 3) Directs the Attorney General to: (1) make publicly available in a registry via the Internet, from information contained in the National Sex Offender Registry or in state sex offender websites, specified information about sexually violent predators and persons convicted of a sexually violent offense or a criminal offense against a minor, who are required to register with a minimally sufficient state sexual offender registration program; and (2) allow registry users to identify offenders who are currently residing within a specified radius of a given location. Requires registry information to include the offender's name, address, date of birth, physical description, and photograph, the nature and date of commission of the offense, and the date on which the offender is released from prison or placed on parole, supervised release, or probation. (Sec. 4) Requires: (1) any state that provides for a civil commitment proceeding to notify the state attorney general of the impending release of a sexually violent predator or a person who has been deemed to be at high-risk for recommitting any sexually violent offense or criminal offense against a minor; (2) the state attorney general, upon receving such notice, to consider instituting a civil commitment proceeding; and (3) each state to intensively monitor, for at least a year, any such person who has been unconditionally released by the state and who has not been civilly committed. Makes a state that fails to implement Act requirements within three years ineligible to receive 25 percent of funds that would otherwise be allocated to it for truth-in-sentencing incentive grants under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.</summary>
