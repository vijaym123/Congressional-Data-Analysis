Requires the Secretary to review existing tools and measures to ensure that such tools and measures include information related to the known risk factors of low birth weight and preterm birth. (Sec. 4) Allows the Secretary to conduct demonstration projects to improve: (1) the provision of information on prematurity to health professionals and the public; and (2) treatment and outcome for babies born preterm. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to establish an Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary, acting through the Surgeon General, to convene a conference on preterm birth. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 7) Delays (until the earlier of June 30, 2007, or 60 days after enactment of a FY2007 authorization of appropriations to carry out the Head Start Act) the effective date of regulations requiring agencies providing transportation services to ensure that children enrolled in Head Start are transported in school buses or allowable alternate vehicles that: (1) are equipped for use of height- and weight-appropriate child restraint systems; and (2) have reverse beepers."
