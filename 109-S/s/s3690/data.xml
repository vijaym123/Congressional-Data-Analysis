  <summary>7/19/2006--Introduced.
Authorizes the Secretary of State to cover the costs of evacuating U.S. nationals from the Middle East in response to the Israel-Hezbollah hostilities that began in July 2006. Directs the Secretary to seek reimbursement for the evacuation of private U.S. citizens or third-country nationals, with discretionary waiver authority in the case of: (1) an evacuated person for whom reimbursement would result in undue financial hardship; and (2) a person who is unable to obtain reimbursement or credit from an air carrier for the unused portion of a commercial round-trip air fare or otherwise use such air fare.</summary>
