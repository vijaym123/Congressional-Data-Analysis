Allows cash only contributions to RSAs up to the lesser of $5,000 (adjusted for inflation) or the taxpayer's compensation includible in gross income for a taxable year. Allows tax free distributions from RSAs after the account beneficiary attains age 58, dies, or becomes disabled.. Allows conversions of individual retirement accounts (IRAs) into RSAs and provides special rules for the tax treatment of amounts converted into an RSA prior to 2007. Requires a five-year holding period for amounts converted to an RSA from an IRA or an Employer Retirement Savings Account."
