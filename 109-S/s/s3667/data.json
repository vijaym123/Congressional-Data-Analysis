States that in view of North Korea's determination to proliferate missiles, nuclear weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction it should be U.S. policy to impose sanctions on persons who transfer such weapons and related goods and technology to and from North Korea in the same manner as persons who transfer such items to and from Iran and Syria currently are sanctioned under U.S. law. Urges all governments concerned about the threat of North Korean proliferation to impose measures on persons involved in such proliferation that are similar to those imposed by the United States pursuant to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, as amended by this Act."
