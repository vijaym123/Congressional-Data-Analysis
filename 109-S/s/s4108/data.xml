Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act - Amends the Colorado River Storage Project Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to construct, operate, and maintain the Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Supply Project. Establishes in the Treasury a Reclamation Water Settlements Fund. Authorizes the Secretary to request a transfer from the Fund to implement a congressionally approved settlement agreement that requires the Bureau of Reclamation to plan, design, and construct: (1) water supply infrastructure; or (2) a project to rehabilitate a water delivery system to conserve water or a project to improve environmental conditions associated with or affected by an existing reclamation project. Authorizes the Secretary to design, construct, operate, and maintain the Project in substantial accordance with the draft environmental impact statement prepared by the Bureau for the Project. Authorizes the Secretary to construct, operate, and maintain specified Project facilities to provide for the delivery of San Juan River water to the city of Gallup, New Mexico, the Navajo Nation, and the Jicarilla Apache Nation. Approves the agreement among New Mexico, the Navajo Nation, and the United States setting forth a stipulated and binding agreement signed on April 19, 2005. Directs the Secretary to: (1) enter into that agreement to the extent that it does not conflict with this Act; and (2) prepare a hydrographic survey to identify and quantify any historic or existing diversion or use of water by the Navajo Nation from the San Juan River Basin. Establishes in the Treasury the Navajo Nation Water Resources Development Trust Fund.</summary>
