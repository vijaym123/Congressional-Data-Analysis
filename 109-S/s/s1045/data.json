Allows the additional disposal only if the Secretary certifies to the defense committees that it: (1) is in the interests of national defense; (2) will not cause undue disruption to the usual markets of ferromanganese producers and processors in the United States; and (3) is consistent with the requirements and purposes of the Stockpile."
