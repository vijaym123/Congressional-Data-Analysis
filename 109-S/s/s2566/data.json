Authorizes the President, to promote cooperation regarding the interdiction of weapons of mass destruction and related materials and delivery systems, to conclude agreements (including reciprocal maritime agreements) with other countries to prevent the transportation of such items to states and non-state actors of proliferation concern. Directs the Secretary of State to notify the Committees after determining a friendly country to be eligible for priority program assistance. Requires that at least 25% of FY2007 assistance for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining and related programs and activities be made available to establish the program, unless otherwise notified as provided for under the Act. Title II: Conventional Arms Disarmament - Conventional Arms Disarmament Act of 2006 - (Sec. 203) States that it is U.S. policy to assist other governments in safeguarding or eliminating stocks of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) and other conventional weapons, including tactical missile systems, that pose a proliferation, local or regional security, or humanitarian threat. (Sec. 204) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out an accelerated global program to secure or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, other conventional weapons, tactical missile systems, and related equipment and facilities that pose a proliferation threat. Sets forth program elements, including: (1) demining activities; (2) elimination or securing of MANPADS and other conventional weapons; (3) assistance for the safe handling and proper storage of MANPADS and other conventional weapons; and (4) cooperative programs with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other international organizations for the safe handling and proper storage or elimination of MANPADS and other conventional weapons. (Sec. 205) Directs the Secretary to report to the Committees on conventional arms threat reduction. Title III: General Authorities - (Sec. 301) Authorizes the President to establish a consolidated Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs Account for the purpose of carrying out specified nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining, and related programs and activities.
