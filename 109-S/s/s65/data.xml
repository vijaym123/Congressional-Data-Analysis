  <summary>3/30/2006--Reported to Senate amended.
Requires the Secretary of Transportation to modify the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) rule prohibiting piloting commercial aircraft by pilots age 60 and over to: (1) provide that a pilot who attains age 60 may serve as a pilot until age 65 on the condition that such pilot serves only as a pilot in a multi-crew aircraft operation and when there is not another pilot age 60 in the crew; and (2) eliminate the prohibition against piloting by pilots age 60 and over. Prohibits such modification from providing the basis for a claim of seniority made under any labor bargaining agreement in effect between the pilots and an air carrier by any pilot seeking re-employment by an air carrier following the pilot's previous termination or cessation of employment. Requires the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to report to Congress on the effect, if any, of the modification on aviation safety.</summary>
