Amends the National Climate Program Act to prohibit: (1) regulated electric utilities from recovering additional costs from ratepayers for reducing carbon dioxide emissions; and (2) state utility commissions from compelling ratepayers to pay any amount incurred by a regulated public utility for reducing carbon dioxide emissions."
