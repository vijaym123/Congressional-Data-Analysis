Employment Verification Act of 2005 - Amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Act) to establish a mandatory electronic worker verification system on a two-to-five year phased-in basis (depending on the number of employees). Provides: (1) for protection from unauthorized disclosure and discrimination; and (2) that employers who use the system will be considered to be in compliance with specified employment verification requirements under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Directs the Secretary of Commerce to review the impact of the employment eligibility verification system (established under the Act) on each class of employers, and certify for each such class that the system: (1) does not result in increased discrimination; and (2) does not interfere with the hiring process for employers or cause a waiting period longer than five days before a new hire can be confirmed as employment eligible. Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to identify the sources of false or expired Social Security numbers and take steps to eliminate them from the Social Security system. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) fully integrate all system databases and data systems and provide the Social Security Administration (SSA) with access to such information; (2) establish rules, policies, and operating and auditing procedures for collecting, removing, and updating system data; and (3) establish a clearinghouse bureau for the public to correct system information. Amends INA to provide that documents establishing employability shall be: (1) a qualifying Social Security card; or (2) A U.S.-issued machine readable employment authorization card. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for employment-related false citizenship claims. Increases civil monetary penalties for hiring, recruiting, referral, and paperwork violations. Amends the Social Security Act to establish criminal penalties for misuse of Social Security account numbers.</summary>
