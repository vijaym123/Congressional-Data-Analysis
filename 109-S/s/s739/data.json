    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2005-04-07", 
    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the manufacture or importation of explosive materials for sale or distribution unless such materials are legibly identified by marks that: (1) identify the name of the manufacturer and the location, date, and shift of manufacture; and (2) are placed on each cartridge, bag, or other immediate container of such materials and on any outside container used for the packaging. Requires such marks with respect to detonators on only the containers used for packaging. Permits the Attorney General to authorize a licensed manufacturer or importer to identify in a different manner: (1) explosive materials upon receipt of a manufacturer's or importer's written application showing that the alternative identification is reasonable and will not hinder the effective administration of this Act; and (2) fireworks. Requires an importer, not later than 24 hours after the release of explosive materials from the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to submit a report to the Attorney General that contains: (1) the name and address of the importer; (2) the manufacturer of the materials; (3) the city and country where the materials were manufactured; (4) the product name, size, and other identification marks; and (5) the date and shift of manufacture of the materials. Directs the Attorney General to issue final regulations to carry out this Act within six months, giving deference to the standards for safety and security marking recognized in the explosives industry."
