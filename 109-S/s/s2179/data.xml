  <summary>1/18/2006--Introduced.
Curtailing Lobbyist Effectiveness Through Advance Notification, Updates, and Posting Act or the CLEAN UP Act - Amends rule XXVII (Conference Committees, Reports, Open Meetings) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to require the joint explanatory statement by a conference committee to identify and explain separately each provision of the report in violation of the rule against inclusion of new or non-germane matter, and, if possible, identify the Member who proposed such provision. Makes it out of order to consider a conference report unless the senior managers from the majority and minority parties on the part of the Senate include in the accompanying statement of managers a signed statement that: (1) all Senate managers have been afforded an opportunity at a meeting of the conference committee to vote on all amendments and other propositions considered; (2) roll call votes have been held in public meetings of the conferees on the matter contained in any motion to instruct conferees passed by the Senate; and (3) the minority was offered an opportunity to submit dissenting or minority views for the joint statement. Declares that the reading in full of any bill, resolution, conference report, or amendment shall not be dispensed with unless such measure is available to all Members and made available to the general public by means of the Internet for at least 72 hours before its consideration. Prohibits consideration of an appropriation bill unless a list of all earmarks in the bill and accompanying reports is available in the same manner. Allows a waiver of such prohibitions by a two-thirds majority vote of Members.</summary>
