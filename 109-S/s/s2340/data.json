    "text": "Community Cancer Care Preservation Act of 2006 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to subject to quarterly reconciliation any payments to physicians for drugs or biologicals made according to average sales price payment methodology in order to assure that they do not exceed or fall short of the actual average sales price during any preceding period. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to review all such payments in the preceding quarter and compare them to the verified average sales price reported by the manufacturer for such quarter. Removes prompt pay discounts from the calculation of the manufacturer's average sales price. Extends through December 31, 2006, the current demonstration project to identify and assess oncology services that positively affect cancer outcomes. Requires the Secretary to make an additional 2% drug administration services payment to physicians for overhead and related costs. Directs the Secretary to develop indicators for the evaluation of the quality of oncology services provided in the physician office setting. Requires the Director of the National Cancer Institute to develop a strategic plan to increase the number of cancer patients who enroll in clinical trials."
