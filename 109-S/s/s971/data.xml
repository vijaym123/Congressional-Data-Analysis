  <summary>4/28/2005--Introduced.
Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting From Advanced Car Technologies (CLEAR ACT) Act of 2005 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for investment in alternative motor vehicles, including qualified fuel cell, hybrid, and alternative fuel vehicles. Bases the amount of such credit on criteria relating to vehicle weight and fuel efficiency. Modifies the tax credit for qualified electric vehicles to remove the ten percent limitation and base the credit amount on criteria relating to vehicle weight, mileage, and payload. Makes leased vehicles eligible for such credit. Extends such credit through 2010. Allows a tax credit for: (1) 50 percent of expenditures for the installation of qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property; and (2) retail sales of alternative fuels as motor vehicle fuels. Directs the Comptroller General to undertake an ongoing analysis of: the effectiveness of the alternative motor vehicle and fuel incentives provided by this Act and to report to Congress on such study by December 31, 2006, and annually thereafter.</summary>
