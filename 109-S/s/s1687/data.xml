  <summary>9/12/2005--Introduced.
National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program Reauthorization Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive requirements for awarding breast and cervical cancer grants to states if certain conditions are met, including that the Secretary finds that granting such a waiver will not reduce the number of women in the state receiving examinations and screening for breast and cervical cancers nor the quality of such services. Provides that such waivers are for two-year periods. Requires the Secretary to review performance under the waiver and allows the Secretary to extend such waivers. Authorizes appropriations for such grants through FY2011.</summary>
