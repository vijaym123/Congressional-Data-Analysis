    "text": "Efficiency in Government Health Care Spending Act - States that it is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Health and Human Services should exercise the authority under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to negotiate prices for Medicare prescription drugs so as to assure an affordable Medicare drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers. Amends part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of SSA title XVIII (Medicare) to repeal the prohibition against the Secretary's negotiating with drug manufacturers, pharmacies, and Medicare prescription drug plan sponsors concerning the prices of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Grants the Secretary, instead, authority similar to that of other Federal entities that purchase prescription drugs in bulk in order to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of covered part D drugs. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a particular formulary for covered part D drugs."
