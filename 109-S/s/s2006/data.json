    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to conduct and report to Congress on a comprehensive assessment of Corps of Engineers projects and studies in Louisiana affected by Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita to determine whether opportunities exist for project modifications or project integration that may reduce future hurricane impacts, further other project purposes, or provide efficiencies in the implementation of hurricane protection, flood control, navigation, or ecosystem restoration projects by the Corps. Provides that the assessment shall not be constrained by any cost-benefit analysis and shall include: (1) a description of means of providing an increased level of hurricane protection using a combination of structural and nonstructural features; (2) a review of the use of a combination of structural means (such as levees and floodgates) and nonstructural means (such as wetlands and beaches) in providing hurricane protection; and (3) a prioritization of actions that should be taken to improve the level of hurricane protection provided. Directs the Secretary, using the results of the assessment, to conduct a comprehensive, integrated water resources analysis, design, and development of a full range of flood control, navigation, ecosystem restoration, and hurricane protection measures for southern Louisiana. Directs the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees initial and final reports detailing an integrated approach to category five hurricane protection, flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration for the Gulf Coast region of the state, that includes: (1) a description of an overall approach for future Corps spending in that region; (2) an identification of specific changes to ongoing projects and studies, as well as proposals for future projects, in that region; and (3) a consideration of potential future projects, including projects involving the restoration, protection, or enhancement of barrier islands, coastal restoration, the closing of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, the filling in of canals, and the relocation and protection of pumping stations and drainage infrastructure. Provides funding from amounts made available by the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act."
