  <summary>4/24/2006--Introduced.
Common Sense Cross-Border Travel and Security Act of 2006 - Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to require that the travel document plan for U.S. citizens and others with waived document requirements traveling into the United States: (1) include a fee-free "day pass" system that would permit U.S. citizens to travel to Canada for a 24-hour period without a passport by completing a day pass application at any port of entry along the U.S.-Canadian land border, and certifying that there was not sufficient time to apply for a passport before the excursion; and (2) provide that U.S. citizens under 18 years of age who are accompanied by a parent or guardian shall not be required to present a passport when returning to the United States from Canada. Limits fees to not more that $20 for any passport card or travel document issued pursuant to such plan. Directs the Secretary of State to negotiate with the government of Canada to ensure the acceptance of such U.S. passport cards and day passes for travel to Canada.</summary>
