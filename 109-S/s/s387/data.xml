Climate Change Technology Tax Incentives Act of 2005 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) a tax credit for investment in a greenhouse gas intensity reduction project; (2) a business tax credit for production from a qualifying clean coal technology unit; (3) a tax credit for investment in qualifying advanced clean coal technology; (4) a business tax credit for production from a qualifying advanced clean coal technology unit; and (5) a business tax credit for production from advanced nuclear power facilities. Permits the transfer of unused credit amounts by certain organizations, including tax-exempt organizations, public utilities, States, and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Terminates all tax credits proposed by this Act after 2010.
