  <summary>7/26/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Power Act with respect to equitability within territory restricted electric systems (the prohibition against any Federal Power Commission order that requires an electric utility, otherwise prohibited by federal law from being a direct or indirect source of power supply outside a particular area, or one of its distributors, to provide transmission services to another entity if the electric energy to be transmitted will be consumed within the area set forth in such federal law, unless the order is in furtherance of a sale of electric energy to that electric utility). Declares that such prohibition shall not apply to any area in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</summary>
