Congressional Commission on Expanding Social Service Delivery Options Act - Establishes a Congressional Commission on Expanding Social Service Delivery Options. Directs the Commission to: (1) study all matters relating to increasing beneficiary-selected or beneficiary-directed options for social service delivery (delivery options) in federal social service programs, including certificate, scholarship, voucher, or other forms of indirect delivery; (2) review all relevant existing programs, including initiatives of the Corporation for National and Community Service; and (3) determine and recommend program areas for which it is appropriate and feasible to implement such delivery options fully or partially. Requires the Commission to promote goals of: (1) expanding consumer and beneficiary choice in such programs; (2) maximizing use of governmental resources in them; and (3) minimizing concerns relating to any precedent under the Constitution regarding participation in them of faith-based providers.</summary>
