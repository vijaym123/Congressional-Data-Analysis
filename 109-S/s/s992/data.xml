  <summary>5/10/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to eliminate the consumptive demand exception to the prohibition against importation of goods manufactured by convict, forced, or indentured labor. (The consumptive demand exception allows importation of such prohibited goods if similar goods are not sufficiently produced in the United States to meet U.S. consumer demand.)</summary>
