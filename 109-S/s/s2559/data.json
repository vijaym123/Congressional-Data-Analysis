Covers both: (1) those who offer or provide a Member of Congress, or his or her employee, with anything of value with the intent to influence the performance of an official act; as well as (2) Members and staff who accept such things, or hold an undisclosed financial interest, with intent to be so influenced. Authorizes funds to the Department of Justice for additional personnel to investigate and prosecute honest services fraud, bribery, graft, and conflicts of interest offenses."
