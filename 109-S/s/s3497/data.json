    "text": "Las Cienegas Enhancement Act - Requires the Secretary of the Interior, if Las Cienegas Conservation, LLC offers to convey to the Secretary title to the Empirita-Simonson parcel of land (the non-federal land), to accept the offer and simultaneously convey to Las Cienegas Conservation, LLC the Sahuarita parcel of land (the federal land). Requires the values of the federal and non-federal lands exchanged to be equal, as determined by appraisals. Requires Las Cienegas Conservation, LLC, to: (1) pay the costs of carrying out the exchange of such lands; (2) enter into an agreement with Pima County, Arizona, to convey to Pima County a certain well site; and (3) relinquish to Pima County any water rights to such well site held by Las Cienegas Conservation, LLC. Makes the exchange of federal and non-federal land subject to any easements, rights-of-way, and other valid encumbrances in existence on enactment of this Act. Requires the non-federal land, upon acquisition by the Secretary, to become part of the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area. Modifies the boundary of the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area to exclude the 40-acre tract that is leased by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to the town of Elgin, Arizona, for a sanitary landfill. Instructs the Secretary to provide to the Secretary of Agriculture a right-of-way through the non-federal land for motorized public road access to the boundary of the Coronado National Forest."
