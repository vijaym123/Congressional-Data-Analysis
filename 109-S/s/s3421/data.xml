Requires the Secretary to furnish prescription drugs and medicines for any veteran not being provided nursing home care: (1) but in need of such drugs or medicines for a service-connected disability; or (2) who has a service-connected disability rated at 50 percent or more and is in need of such drugs or medicines. Requires each state home that requests such payment or reimbursement to furnish appropriate veteran identifying information.

Allows: (1) the use of noncompetitive procedures (a preference) within the VA in entering into contracts with such small businesses for an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act); (2) VA contracting officers to award sole source contracts to such businesses for contracts above the simplified acquisition threshold but below $5 million; and (3) the use of restricted competition to such small businesses if two or more of such businesses will submit offers and the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.

Requires the Secretary, if a potential misuse is determined, to provide to affected individuals credit protection services, fraud alerts, and credit monitoring through credit reporting agencies.
