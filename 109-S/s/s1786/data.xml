Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make airport development project grants from unobligated apportioned airport improvement funds for FY2005 and FY2006 for emergency capital and operating costs of repairing or replacing public use facilities damaged by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita which are incurred by a public use airport in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, or Texas listed in the Federal Aviation Administration's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems. Authorizes the Secretary to waive any applicable grant limitation or requirement if the Secretary determines that it is necessary to respond to the urgent needs of the region damaged by the hurricanes. Sets the federal share of project costs at 100%.</summary>
