  <summary>6/27/2006--Introduced.
Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to deem it to be an unfair method of competition affecting commerce for a person, in connection with the sale of a drug product, to be a party to any agreement resolving or settling a patent infringement claim in which: (1) an abbreviated new drug (generic) application filer receives anything of value; and (2) such filer agrees not to research, develop, manufacture, market, or sell the generic product for any period. Excludes a resolution or settlement that includes no more than the right to market the generic product prior to the expiration of the patent.</summary>
