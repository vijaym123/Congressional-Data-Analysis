    "text": "Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers beyond Borders Act of 2006 or the U.S. SAFE WEB Act of 2006 - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to include within the term \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" those acts or practices involving foreign commerce that: (1) cause or are likely to cause reasonably foreseeable injury within the United States; or (2) involve material conduct occurring within the United States. Declares that remedies available to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for unfair and deceptive acts or practices include restitution to domestic or foreign victims. Authorizes the FTC to disclose certain privileged or confidential information to foreign law enforcement agencies and to grant investigative assistance to them. Grants the FTC power to transmit to the Attorney General evidence of a violation of federal criminal law by any person, partnership, or corporation, either domestic or foreign. Authorizes the FTC to designate its attorneys to assist the Attorney General with litigation in foreign courts on particular matters in which it has an interest. Prescribes procedural guidelines for sharing by FTC with foreign law enforcement agencies of information obtained pursuant to compulsory process or investigation. Declares the FTC subject to the Right to Financial Privacy Act, but specifies conditions relating to procedures for delay of notification or prohibition of disclosure, and ex parte proceedings. Exempts from coverage by such Act an investigation or proceeding related to the administration of federal or foreign antitrust laws. Shields from liability voluntary providers of information, including certain financial institutions. Authorizes the FTC to accept payment or reimbursement from a domestic or foreign law enforcement agency, or payment or reimbursement made on behalf of such agency, for expenses incurred by the FTC in carrying out any of its proper activities. Terminates this Act seven years after its enactment."
