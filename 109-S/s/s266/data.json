    "text": "Stop Government Propaganda Act - Imposes a civil penalty on a senior official of an Executive branch agency who authorizes or directs funds appropriated to such agency for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States. Instructs the Attorney General to diligently investigate such a violation, and if the Attorney General finds that a person has committed such a violation or is committing such a violation, authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action against that person. Allows a private person to bring a civil action for such a violation for the person and for the U.S. Government in the name of the Government. Permits the dismissal of such an action only if the court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting. Prohibits any person other than the Government from intervening or bringing a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action. Specifies the rights of the parties with regard to such an action. Allows the Government to elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to it. Sets forth requirements for whistleblower protections. States that the U.S. courts shall take cognizance and notice of any legal decision of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) interpreting the application of this Act. Prohibits a point of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider legislation providing an appropriation for an agency that the GAO has found in violation of this Act, unless the appropriations for salary and expenses for the head of the relevant agency contains a provision reducing the salary of the head by an amount equal to the illegal expenditure."
