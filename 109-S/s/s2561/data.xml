Bureau of Reclamation Water Conservation, Efficiency, and Management Improvement Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to provide grants to, and enter into cooperative agreements with, nonfederal entities with water delivery authority to pay the federal share of the cost of a project to conserve water, increase water use efficiency, facilitate water markets, enhance water management, or implement other actions to prevent water-related crises or conflicts in watersheds that have a nexus to federal water projects within reclamation states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming). Directs the Secretary to publish assistance eligibility and priority criteria. Limits the federal cost share of the project to 50%. Sets the nonfederal cost share for project operation and maintenance at 100%. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with institutions of higher education, nonprofit research institutions, or organizations with water or power delivery authority to fund research to conserve water, increase water use efficiency, or enhance water management.</summary>
