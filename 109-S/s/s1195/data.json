    "text": "National Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to establish a site and operating permit process to make areas of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone available to persons to develop and operate offshore aquaculture facilities. Excludes offshore aquaculture from certain fishery conservation requirements under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) establish permit fees; and (2) modify or suspend such permits. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to aquaculture operations located on facilities subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, to: (1) enforce all requirements contained in federal mineral leases and regulations issued pursuant to such Act; (2) require and enforce additional conditions necessary to protect the marine environment, property, or human life or health; and (3) issue orders to any offshore aquaculture permit holder to take appropriate action to ensure safe oil and gas or other mineral operations on such facility. Sets forth certain environmental requirements for offshore aquaculture facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to establish an integrated, multidisciplinary, scientific research and development (R&D) program to further offshore aquaculture technologies compatible with the protection of marine ecosystems. Makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) falsify any information required to be reported, or any regulation or permit issued, under this Act; (2) engage in offshore aquaculture within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone except in full compliance with this Act; or (3) violate any provision of this Act. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Provides for judicial review of civil penalties or permit sanctions."
