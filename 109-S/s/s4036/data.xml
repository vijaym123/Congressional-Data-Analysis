  <summary>9/29/2006--Introduced.
Budget Enforcement Legislative Tools Act of 2006 - Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to provide for expedited consideration of certain rescissions proposed by the President of discretionary budget authority in an appropriation Act. Prohibits funds made available for obligation under this procedure from being proposed for rescission again. Sets forth requirements for: (1) the President's transmittal to Congress of a special message regarding a proposed rescission; (2) a maximum 25% ceiling on amounts subject to rescission; and (3) expedited congressional consideration of such proposal. Makes it out of order in the Senate to consider any direct spending or revenue legislation that would increase the on-budget deficit or cause an on-budget deficit for: (1) the first year or first five fiscal years covered by the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; or (2) the five fiscal years following such fiscal years. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to retain (by eliminating the expiration of) pay-as-you-go requirements. Extends specified budget enforcement mechanisms through FY2011.</summary>
