Gives local grant priority to entities that: (1) will serve at least one school eligible for schoolwide programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and more than one full-service community school as part of a community or districtwide strategy; and (2) demonstrate a record of effectiveness in integrating at least three of various qualified services."
