Title XXVIII: General Provisions - Subtitle A: Military Construction Program and Military Family Housing Changes - (Sec. 2801) Increases from: (1) $1.5 million to $2.5 million the unspecified minor military construction project threshold (after which more detailed notification and project description requirements apply); and (2) $3 million to $4 million the maximum approved cost for a military construction project intended to correct a deficiency that is life-, health-, or safety-threatening.

(Sec. 2885) Amends the NDAA for Fiscal Year 1996 to extend through FY2006 the DOD laboratory revitalization program.

(Sec. 2893) Requires the Secretary, no later than May 31, 2007, to complete an identification of the environmental condition of the real property of each military installation approved for closure or realignment under the 2005 round of defense base closures and realignments in accordance with provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). Directs the Secretary to provide a notice of such results to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and any other affected federal agency or tribal government official, which shall include a request for concurrence in the Secretary's findings. Directs the Secretary to: (1) expedite any necessary environmental response at such installations; and (2) report annually to Congress on progress made. (Sec. 2894) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should not transfer any unit from a military installation closed or realigned due to the relocation of forces under the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy or the 2005 round of defense base closures or realignments until adequate facilities and infrastructure necessary to support the unit's mission and quality of life requirements for military families are ready for use at the receiving location."
