Revises the process for issuing permits for the construction and operation of a refinery. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to (1) solicit applications for grants under the EPA Natural Gas STAR Program to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas industries; and (2) conduct workshops to provide information to state officials on methane emission reduction techniques. Amends the Clean Air Act to: (1) hold states harmless for emission levels resulting from emergency waivers granted by EPA; and (2) require the Administrator to revoke the approval of certain fuels no longer included in a state implementation plan. Requires the Administrator to: (1) conduct a research and demonstration program to evaluate the air quality benefits of ultra-clean Fischer-Tropsch transportation fuel, including diesel and jet fuel; (2) evaluate the use of such fuel for reducing engine exhaust emissions; and (3) submit recommendations and reports to Congress. Authorizes loan guarantees for domestic coal and petroleum coke-based Fischer-Tropsch commercial demonstration projects."
