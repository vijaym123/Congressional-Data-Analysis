Directs the Secretary of Transportation to transfer 90% of civil penalties for noncompliance with automobile fuel economy standards to the Trust Fund to finance such grant program.Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to provide low-interest loans to build service stations which dispense E-85 (85% ethanol content) fuel to retail consumers."
