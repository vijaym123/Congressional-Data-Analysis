Increases the maximum tax credit amounts for the advanced coal and gasification project programs. Extends through 2012 the taxpayer election to expense certain crude oil refinery property. Exempts certain alternative motor vehicles and qualified electric vehicles eligible for tax credits from the depreciation limitations applicable to luxury vehicles."
