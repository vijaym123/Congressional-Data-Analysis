Requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue minimum performance requirements for the strength of seats and the attachment of seats and seat belts in vehicles that are converted, after being sold for purposes other than resale, for the purpose of transporting such workers. Requires, effective seven years after enactment of this Act, vehicles converted for transport of such workers to provide the same level of safety as vehicles manufactured or altered for such purpose prior to being sold for purposes other than resale."
