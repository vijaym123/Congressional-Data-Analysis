Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) establish a toll-free naturalization assistance telephone number available only to members and their families; and (2) after any modification of naturalization laws, update the appropriate application form, instructions and guidebook, and Internet website to reflect such modification. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) report to the congressional defense and judiciary committees on the entire process for adjudication of an application for naturalization; and (2) conduct a study on the implementation of this Act by the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense."
