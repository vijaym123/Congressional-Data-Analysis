(Sec. 5) Amends the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 to direct the President, with waiver authority including congressional notification, to block the assets and deny visas and entry to any individual (and family member) responsible for acts of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity in Darfur. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the President to provide assistance to reinforce the deployment and operations of an expanded African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). Directs the President to instruct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to advocate NATO reinforcement of AMIS, upon request of the African Union (AU). Directs the President to deny the government of Sudan access to oil revenues, including by prohibiting U.S. entry to cargo ships or oil tankers engaged in the oil sector of Sudan or involved in the shipment of goods for use by the armed forces of Sudan until such time as the government of Sudan has honored its commitments to cease attacks on civilians, demobilize the Janjaweed and associated militias, grant free access for deliveries of humanitarian assistance, and allow for the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons.
