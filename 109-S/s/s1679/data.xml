Working to Enhance Courts for At-Risk and Endangered Kids Act of 2005 - Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) with respect to courts for at-risk children. Provides or revises requirements for: (1) collaboration among state IV-B (Child and Family Services) and IV-E agencies; (2) outcome performance standards for abuse and neglect courts; (3) court model standards; (4) state flexibility for public access to courts; (5) orderly and timely processing for interstate placement of children; (6) complete background checks, including child abuse registries, before approval of any foster or adoptive placement; (7) health and education records; (8) the right to be heard in foster care proceedings; (9) court improvement; and (10) use of interjurisdictional resources. Amends SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) to allow courts access to the Federal Parent Locator Service to locate parents in foster care or adoptive placement cases. Amends SSA title XI part A (General Provisions) to require each state administering a program under SSA title IV part B or part E to establish a permanent, multidisciplinary, broad-based commission on state child welfare programs. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide for loan forgiveness for: (1) family law, juvenile law, and domestic relations attorneys who work in the defense of low-income families, individuals, or children; and (2) child welfare workers. Amends the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to reauthorize at increased levels the Court Appointed Special Advocate Program, including such programs in rural and underserved urban areas. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Chief Justice for each state and other state court leadership should take the lead in providing for the health, safety, and permanency of children before state abuse and neglect courts.</summary>
