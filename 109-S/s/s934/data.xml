  <summary>4/28/2005--Introduced.
Reform Health Care Now Act - Requires the chairs of specified congressional committees, within 30 calendar days after the commencement of the session of Congress following the enactment of this Act, each to introduce a bill to provide a significant increase in access to health care coverage for the people of the United States. Authorizes the ranking minority party member of a committee, if the chair fails to introduce the bill within the 30-day period, to introduce one that will qualify for the expedited procedure provided in this Act. Qualifies a bill if: (1) its title reads "to reform the health care system of the United States and to provide insurance coverage for Americans;" (2) it reaches the goal of providing health care coverage to 95 % of Americans within 10 years; and (3) it is deficit neutral. Sets forth procedures for expedited consideration of such legislation in both chambers.</summary>
