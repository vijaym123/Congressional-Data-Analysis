Musconetcong Wild and Scenic Rivers Act - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (the Act) to designate specified segments of the Musconetcong River, New Jersey, as scenic and recreational rivers. Prohibits such designated river segments from being administered as part of the National Park System. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage those segments in accordance with the Musconetcong River Management Plan (dated April 2003), which establishes goals and actions to ensure long-term protection of the outstanding values of the river segments and compatible management of land and water resources associated with such segments. Considers the management plan as satisfying the requirements for a comprehensive management plan for those river segments. Directs the Secretary, in determining whether a proposed water resources project would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which a river segment is designated as part of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, to consider the extent to which the project is consistent with the management plan. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance, staff support, and funding to assist in the implementation of the management plan. Requires the Secretary to manage the river segments in cooperation with appropriate Federal, State, regional, and local agencies. Requires any cooperative agreement entered into under the Act relating to a river segment to be consistent with the management plan. Permits an agreement to include provisions for financial or other assistance from the United States to facilitate the long-term protection, conservation, and enhancement of the river segment. Authorizes the Secretary to provide planning, financial, and technical assistance to local municipalities and nonprofit organizations to assist in the implementation of actions to protect the natural and historic resources of the river segments. Considers, after adoption of recommendations made in section IV of the management plan, the zoning ordinances of the municipalities bordering the segments as satisfying requirements with respect to the curtailment of condemnation power in urban areas covered by valid and satisfactory zoning ordinances. Provides for the designation of an additional river segment if there is adequate local support and for its administration as a recreational river. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
