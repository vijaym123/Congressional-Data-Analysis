Amends the Standing Rules of the Senate to: (1) exclude gifts from lobbyists from the gift ban exceptions; and (2) prohibit reimbursement from individuals for travel by a Member, officer, or employee. Allows travel reimbursement only from charitable organizations not affiliated with any group that lobbies before Congress. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit a political committee from being designated as an authorized committee if a registered lobbyist is formally affiliated with it."
