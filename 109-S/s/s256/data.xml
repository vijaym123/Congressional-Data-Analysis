  <summary>4/20/2005--Public Law.
Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 - Title I: Needs-Based Bankruptcy - (Sec. 101) Amends Federal bankruptcy law to revamp guidelines governing dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 liquidation (complete relief in bankruptcy) to one under either Chapter 11 (Reorganization) or Chapter 13 (Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income). Permits the bankruptcy court to convert a Chapter 7 case to either Chapter 11 or 13 with a debtor's consent. (Current law requires the debtor's request for such a conversion.) (Sec. 102) Permits the court upon its own motion, or upon the motion of the bankruptcy trustee, bankruptcy administrator, or any party in interest, to move for a dismissal. (Current law prohibits a party in interest from entering such motions.) Lowers the "substantial abuse" standard for dismissal or conversion to one of simple abuse. Replaces the presumption in favor of granting the relief sought by the debtor with a presumption that abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly income exceeds an amount determined according to specified formulae. Prohibits inclusion of any payments for debts within the statutory calculation of debtor's applicable and actual expenses. Includes within the calculation of debtor's monthly expenses: (1) reasonably necessary expenses incurred to maintain the safety of the debtor and the debtor's family from family violence as identified under the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act; (2) continuation of actual expenses paid by the debtor for the care and support of an elderly, chronically ill, or disabled household or nondependent immediate family member; and (3) an additional allowance for housing and utilities based upon documented home energy expenses. Provides that the presumption of abuse may only be rebutted with detailed documentation of special circumstances requiring additional expenses or adjustment of current monthly total income for which there is no reasonable alternative. Prohibits the court from dismissing or converting a case based on any form of means testing, if the debtor is a disabled veteran and the indebtedness occurred primarily during a period during which he or she was: (1) on active duty or (2) performing a homeland defense activity. Requires the debtor's counsel to reimburse the bankruptcy trustee for legal fees in prosecuting a dismissal or conversion motion if the court finds that counsel's filing under Chapter 7 was in violation of certain bankruptcy rules. Requires the court, upon motion by the victim of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime (or at the request of a party in interest), to dismiss a voluntary case filed by an individual debtor convicted of that crime (unless the debtor establishes that filing of the case is necessary to satisfy a claim for a domestic support obligation). Redefines "disposable income" of a chapter 13 debtor to exclude a domestic support obligation that first becomes payable after the date the petition is filed. Cites circumstances under which a chapter 13 wage earner's plan may be modified after confirmation to include a special allowance for health insurance coverage. (Sec. 103) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to alter Internal Revenue Service (IRS) standards established to set guidelines for repayment plans as needed to accommodate their use under the Bankruptcy Code. Instructs the Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to report to certain congressional committees regarding the use of IRS standards for determining specified monthly debtor expenses and the impact of such standards upon debtors and the bankruptcy courts. (Sec. 104) Revises procedural guidelines to mandate a written notice to the individual consumer debtor before commencement of a case stating: (1) the types of services available from credit counseling agencies; (2) the criminal penalties for fraudulent concealment of assets; and (3) that all creditor-supplied information is subject to examination by the Attorney General. (Sec. 105) Instructs the Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to: (1) develop a financial management training curriculum and materials to educate individual debtors on how to better manage their finances; and (2) test, evaluate, and report to Congress on the curriculum's effectiveness. (Sec. 106) Prohibits an individual debtor from filing under Federal bankruptcy law unless the individual has received a briefing from an approved nonprofit budget and credit counseling service prior to filing a bankruptcy petition, unless the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator determines that the service for the district in which the debtor lives is not reasonably able to provide adequate services to the additional individuals who would otherwise seek credit counseling because of such requirement. Exempts from such prerequisite a debtor whom the court determines is unable to comply due to incapacity, disability, or active military duty in a military combat zone. Conditions a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 discharge in bankruptcy upon the debtor's completion of an approved instructional course concerning personal financial management. Requires the clerk of each district to maintain a public list of credit counseling agencies and instructional courses concerning personal financial management. Prescribes criteria for approval of such agencies and courses. Prohibits such a counseling service from informing a credit reporting agency whether an individual debtor has received or sought personal financial management instruction. Establishes civil penalties for noncompliance. (Sec. 107) Requires the Director of the Executive Office for United States Trustees to issue schedules of reasonable and necessary administrative expenses of administering a chapter 13 plan for each judicial district of the United States. Title II: Enhanced Consumer Protection - Subtitle A: Penalties for Abusive Creditor Practices - (Sec. 201) Cites circumstances under which the court may reduce a claim based upon unsecured consumer debts by up to 20 percent if the debtor can show by clear and convincing evidence that the claim was filed by a creditor who unreasonably refused to negotiate a reasonable alternative repayment schedule proposed by an approved credit counseling agency acting on the debtor's behalf. (Sec. 202) States that a creditor's willful failure to credit payments received from a debtor is a violation of a discharge operating as an injunction against a collection action if such failure caused material injury to the debtor (with certain exceptions). (Sec. 203) Modifies debt reaffirmation guidelines governing wholly unsecured consumer debts to mandate specified detailed disclosures and explanations to the debtor for dischargeable debt agreements. Exempts a Credit Union creditor from such detailed disclosures and explanations. Amends Federal criminal law to instruct the Attorney General to designate U.S. attorneys and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to implement enforcement activities relating to: (1) abusive reaffirmations of debt; and (2) materially fraudulent statements in bankruptcy schedules that are intentionally false or misleading. Directs the bankruptcy court to establish procedures referring those cases to the U.S. attorneys and FBI agents. (Sec. 204) Preserves consumer claims and defenses against predatory loans that have been sold by the bankruptcy trustee and that are subject to either the Truth in Lending Act or any consumer credit contract. (Sec. 205) Instructs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the overall treatment of consumers within the context of the debt reaffirmation process, including recommendations for legislation to address abusive or coercive tactics. Subtitle B: Priority Child Support - (Sec. 212) Revises priority payment guidelines to place within the first priority claim category certain unsecured claims for domestic support obligations, if the funds received by a governmental unit are applied in a prescribed order. Grants priority over such claims, however, to specified administrative expenses of certain trustees. (Sec. 213) Conditions court confirmation of a debt repayment plan under Chapters 11, 12 (Debts of a Family Farmer), and 13 upon certification that the debtor has paid in full all adjudicated domestic support obligations that become due after the petition filing date. (Sec. 214) Excepts from an automatic stay specified choses-in-action pertaining to domestic support obligations proceedings, including: (1) child custody or visitation; (2) dissolution of marriage; (3) domestic violence; (4) withholding of income that is property of the bankrupt estate for payment of domestic support obligations; (5) suspension of drivers' licenses and professional licenses; (6) reporting of overdue support owed by a parent to certain consumer reporting agencies; (7) interception of specified tax refunds; and (8) enforcement of medical obligations under title IV, part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of the Social Security Act. (Sec. 215) Revamps guidelines governing the nondischargeability of certain debts for alimony, maintenance, and support to repeal the exceptions granted the debtor under specified conditions. (Sec. 216) Modifies guidelines governing property exempt from the bankruptcy estate to declare such property liable for a debt arising from domestic support obligations. (Sec. 217) Prohibits the bankruptcy trustee from avoiding a transfer that is a bona fide payment of a debt for a domestic support obligation. (Sec. 218) Excludes income payments for postpetition domestic support obligations from "disposable income" for purposes of a Chapter 12 confirmation plan. (Sec. 219) Sets forth the duties of the bankruptcy trustee to notify the claim holder and the appropriate State child support agency of the debtor's last known address. (Sec. 220) Declares dischargeable any debts for certain qualified educational loans which, if not discharged, would impose an undue hardship upon either the debtor or the debtor's dependent. Subtitle C: Other Consumer Protections - (Sec. 221) Modifies guidelines governing nonattorney bankruptcy petition preparers to mandate that as a prerequisite to any collection of fees for services: (1) such preparers officially disclose to debtors that they cannot practice law or give legal advice; and (2) such disclosure be signed by the debtor and filed with the requisite court documents. Prescribes enforcement and penalty guidelines for preparer noncompliance. (Sec. 222) Expresses the sense of Congress that States should develop curricula relating to personal finance designed for use in elementary and secondary schools. (Sec. 223) Places in tenth order of priority death or personal injury claims against the bankrupt estate that arise from the debtor's unlawful operation of a motor vehicle or vessel while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. (Sec. 224) Permits an individual debtor to exempt from the property of the bankrupt estate certain tax-exempt retirement funds that have not been obligated in connection with any extension of credit. Excepts from an automatic stay certain income withheld from debtor's wages for the benefit of an employer-sponsored pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or other specified plan. Excepts from a discharge in bankruptcy amounts owed by the debtor to certain plans established under the Internal Revenue Code. Sets an asset limitation on debtor's retirement funds that debtor may exempt from the estate in bankruptcy. (Sec. 225) Sets forth criteria for excluding certain education individual retirement accounts from the property of the bankruptcy estate if the designated beneficiary is the debtor's child or grandchild. (Sec. 227) Sets forth restrictions on debt relief agency practices. Establishes civil penalties for intentional violations. (Sec. 228) Requires a debt relief agency providing bankruptcy assistance to: (1) provide prescribed disclosures to the assisted person; and (2) comply with other specified contractual and advertising requirements. (Sec. 230) Instructs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost of requiring bankruptcy trustees to promptly provide the Office of Child Support Enforcement with a debtor's name, Social Security account, and address upon commencement of the case. (Sec. 231) Prohibits a bankruptcy trustee from selling or leasing to unaffiliated third parties, any personally identifiable information possessed by the debtor concerning an individual if that is contrary to the debtor's privacy policy, unless specified conditions have been met, or the court approves such sale or lease after a consumer privacy ombudsman has been appointed. (Sec. 232) Prescribes procedural guidelines for appointment of a consumer privacy ombudsman. (Sec. 233) States that a debtor may be required to provide information regarding a minor child in a bankruptcy case, but may not be required to disclose the child's name in the public records of the case. Prohibits bankruptcy officials from disclosing the name maintained in a nonpublic record. (Sec. 234) Restricts public access to certain information contained in bankruptcy case files by authorizing the bankruptcy court to bar disclosure of information that it finds would create undue risk of identity theft or other unlawful injury to the individual or the individual's property. Title III: Discouraging Bankruptcy Abuse - (Sec. 301) Modifies exceptions to a discharge in bankruptcy to prohibit discharge of a filing fee imposed by any court upon a prisoner. (Sec. 302) Terminates the automatic stay 30 days after filing of a petition if a chapter 7, 11, or 13 petition was pending and dismissed within the preceding year, unless the subsequent filing is in good faith. Specifies conditions under which a history of previous petitions in bankruptcy gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the case is not filed in good faith. (Sec. 303) Directs the court to grant two-year relief from the automatic stay upon request of a party in interest in connection with certain real property actions if the court finds that filing the bankruptcy petition was part of a scheme to delay, hinder, and defraud creditors. (Sec. 304) Modifies debtor's duties to mandate specified affirmative actions incumbent upon a chapter 7 debtor, including reaffirmation of the debt, or redemption of the property within 45 days, in order to retain possession of personal property. Allows a creditor to take action with respect to such property under nonbankruptcy law if the debtor fails to act within 45 days, unless the court determines upon trustee motion that such property is of consequential value or benefit to the estate. (Sec. 305) Terminates the automatic stay governing property of the debtor's estate that secures a claim, or is subject to an unexpired lease, if the debtor fails to complete within a revised, accelerated time frame an intended surrender of consumer debt collateral, or an intended property redemption, or debt reaffirmation to retain such collateral (unless the court determines upon trustee motion that such property is of consequential value or benefit to the estate). (Sec. 306) Requires the bankruptcy court to confirm a Chapter 13 plan if it provides that the holder of a secured allowed claim shall retain the attendant lien until payment or discharge of all debts. Provides that if a Chapter 13 proceeding is dismissed or converted without completion of the plan, the holder shall retain such lien to the extent recognized by applicable nonbankruptcy law. States that statutory guidelines to determine the secured status of a creditor's claim do not apply if: (1) the creditor has a purchase money security interest securing the debt; (2) the underlying debt was incurred within the 910-day period preceding the filing of the petition; and (3) the collateral for that debt consists of a motor vehicle acquired for the debtor's personal use (or if the collateral consists of any other thing of value if the debt was incurred during the one-year period preceding such filing). (Sec. 307) Increases from 180 days to 730 days the duration of debtor's domicile for purposes of determining which State law governs the debtor's selection of property exempt from the bankrupt estate. Provides for determination of an immediately earlier domicile if the debtor's domicile has not been located in a single State for the 730-day period. Allows a debtor to exempt certain property if the effect of the domiciliary requirement is to render the debtor otherwise ineligible for any exemption. (Sec. 308) Requires reduction of the value of the homestead exemption to the extent that it is attributable to any portion of property disposed of in the ten-year period before the petition filing date with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. (Sec. 309) Revises requirements governing the effects of conversion from chapter 13 to another chapter. Declares that: (1) valuations of property and of allowed secured claims in a chapter 13 case shall not apply in a case converted to chapter 7; and (2) with respect to cases converted from Chapter 13, the claim of any creditor holding security as of the date of the petition shall continue to be secured by that security unless the full claim amount, as determined under applicable nonbankruptcy law, has been paid in full as of the conversion date. States that a prebankruptcy default shall have the effect given under applicable nonbankruptcy law unless it has been fully cured pursuant to the plan at the time of conversion. Provides for a Chapter 7 debtor's assumption of unexpired leases of personal property. Declares that in a Chapter 11 case in which the debtor is an individual, and in a Chapter 13 case, if the lease is not assumed in the plan, it is rejected (thus no longer subject to an automatic stay). Specifies a cash payment plan for chapter 13 debtors for payments to any lessor of personal property and to any creditor holding a claim secured by personal property in order to ensure adequate protection to the claim holder during the payment period. Requires a debtor-in-possession to provide reasonable evidence of any requisite insurance coverage with respect to the use or ownership of such property. (Sec. 310) Revamps nondischargeability guidelines to narrow the window of dischargeability from $1,075 to $500, for aggregate consumer debts owed to a single creditor on luxury goods incurred within 90 days (currently 60 days) prior to the order for bankruptcy relief. Reduces, likewise, from $1,075 to $750, nondischargeable cash advances that are extensions of consumer credit under an open end credit plan if acquired within 70 days (currently 60 days). (Sec. 311) Denies an automatic stay of specified residential real property eviction proceedings by a lessor against a debtor if: (1) the lessor obtained judgment for possession prior to the bankruptcy filing date; or (2) lessor furnishes certification of specified debtor offenses. Provides a procedure by which the debtor may avoid the application of such a denial of the automatic stay of eviction proceedings. (Sec. 312) Extends the time between Chapter 7 discharges from six to eight years. Denies a chapter 13 discharge to any debtor who has received a discharge: (1) in a chapter 7, 11, or 12 case within the preceding four years; or (2) in another chapter 13 case within the preceding two years. (Sec. 313) Defines a debtor's household goods to include specified items. Excludes from such goods: (1) electronic entertainment equipment, antiques or jewelry with more than $500 in aggregate fair market value; (2) works of art; (3) more than one personal computer and related equipment; and (4) motor vehicles, boats, motorized recreational devices, conveyances, vehicles, watercraft, or aircraft. Requires the Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to report to specified congressional committees about use of this definition of household goods with respect to: (1) the avoidance of nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security interests in household goods; and (2) the impact that such definition has had on debtors and on the bankruptcy courts. (Sec. 314) Includes as nondischargeable chapter 13 debts those incurred: (1) to pay a tax to a non-Federal governmental unit; (2) for restitution or a criminal fine included in a sentence on the debtor's conviction of a crime; (3) for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity; or (4) for restitution, or damages, awarded in a civil action against the debtor as a result of willful or malicious injury by the debtor that caused personal injury or death to an individual. (Sec. 315) Prescribes notice procedures for Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 creditors. Expands debtor's duties to require filing with the bankruptcy court of: (1) Federal tax returns; (2) evidence of employer payments received; (3) monthly net income projections; and (4) anticipated income or expenditure increases. Permits a Chapter 7 or chapter 13 creditor to request the debtor's petition, tax schedules, and statement of affairs, including the debt adjustment plan filed by the debtor. Requires dismissal of a Chapter 7 or 13 case upon debtor's failure to provide to the bankruptcy trustee within seven days before the initial date for the first meeting of creditors a tax return for the latest taxable period prior to filing. Requires that, at the time of filing with the taxing authority, a Chapter 7 or 13 debtor file with the bankruptcy court specified tax documentation pertaining to the period from case commencement until case termination. Requires a Chapter 13 debtor to file with the court a statement of income and expenditures in the preceding tax year, and monthly net income, showing how calculated. Makes debtor's mandatory documentation available for inspection and copying to certain bankruptcy officers and any party in interest. Requires debtors to furnish driver's license, passport, or other photograph-containing documentation establishing debtor identification. (Sec. 316) Requires automatic dismissal if a voluntary Chapter 7 or 13 debtor fails to furnish all mandatory information, or fails to timely file the requisite schedules within 45 days of filing a petition. Requires the court to order dismissal within five days of a request by a party in interest for debtor's failure to timely submit requisite documentation. Permits the court, upon trustee motion, to decline to dismiss a case if the debtor made a good faith effort to file all required information and the best interests of creditors would be served by administration of the case. (Sec. 317) Requires a Chapter 13 confirmation hearing to be held not later than 45 days after the first meeting of creditors. (Sec. 318) Sets forth a statutory formula to determine whether a Chapter 13 debt readjustment payment plan shall be of either three-year or five-year duration. (Sec. 319) Expresses the sense of the Congress that rule 9011 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure should include a requirement that all debtors' documents be submitted to the court only after debtors have made reasonable inquiry to verify that all information therein is well grounded in fact, and warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. (Sec. 320) Revises automatic stay guidelines to provide that in the case of an individual filing under Chapters 7, 11, or 13, the automatic stay shall terminate 60 days after a request for its release by a party in interest, unless the court orders, or the parties agree to a longer time. (Sec. 321) Revamps guidelines governing a Chapter 11 business reorganization case filed by an individual to: (1) identify the property of the estate in bankruptcy; and (2) revise the contents, confirmation, and modification of a reorganization plan. (Sec. 322) States that a debtor may not exempt a homestead interest acquired during the 1215-day period preceding petition filing which exceeds in the aggregate $125,000 in value in specified real or personal property. Exempts from such limitation the principal residence of a family farmer. (Sec. 323) Excludes employee benefit plan participant contributions from the property of the bankruptcy estate. (Sec. 324) Amends the Federal judicial code to grant the district court presiding over a title 11 case exclusive jurisdiction over: (1) property of the debtor and the estate in bankruptcy; and (2) actions pertaining to employment of professionals by the bankruptcy trustee, or related disclosure rules. (Sec. 325) Revises U.S. Trustee program filing fees (currently $155 for either chapter 7 or chapter 13) to $200 for chapter 7 and $150 for chapter 13. Revises requirements for deposit of portions of such fees as offsetting collections in the United States Trustee System Fund by increasing the current 27.42 percent of such fees to 40.63 percent of the chapter 7 fee and 70 percent of the chapter 13 fee. Establishes a sunset date for such increases. Earmarks sums resulting from such filing fee increase for the salaries and benefits of additional bankruptcy judgeships created by this Act. (Sec. 326) Exempts from the prohibition against sharing of compensation or reimbursement with respect to administrative expenses of a debtor's estate any sharing, or agreeing to share, compensation with a bona fide public service attorney referral program that operates in accordance with non-Federal law regulating attorney referral services, and with rules of professional responsibility applicable to attorney acceptance of referrals. (Sec. 327) States that, if the debtor is an individual chapter 7 or 13 debtor, the value of personal property securing an allowed claim shall be determined based on its replacement value as of the date of petition filing without deduction for costs of sale or marketing. (Sec. 328) Revises requirements for the assumption by a trustee of a defaulted executory contract or unexpired lease. Exempts from the requirement that the trustee cure such a default any default that is a breach of a provision relating to the satisfaction of any non-penalty provision relating to a default arising from any failure to perform nonmonetary obligations under an unexpired lease of real property, if it is impossible for the trustee to cure such default by performing nonmonetary acts at and after the time of assumption. Provides, however, that if such default arises from a failure to operate in accordance with a nonresidential real property lease, then such default shall be cured by performance at and after the time of assumption in accordance with such lease, and pecuniary losses resulting from such default shall be compensated in accordance with specified law. Makes the same exception to requirements a plan must meet to avoid impairing a class of claims or interests. Requires a plan, to avoid impairment, to compensate a claim holder for any actual pecuniary loss incurred by such holder resulting from a failure to perform a nonmonetary obligation, other than a default arising from failure to operate a nonresidential real property lease subject to certain requirements. (Sec. 329) Expands permissible administrative expenses to include certain wages and benefits awarded as back pay (resulting from a debtor employer's violation of law), if the court determines that the award will not substantially increase the probability of layoff or termination of current employees or nonpayment of domestic support obligations during the case. (Sec. 330) Instructs the court to withhold a debtor's discharge upon its reasonable belief that a proceeding is pending in which debtor may be found guilty of a felony, or become liable for specified debts. (Sec. 331) Prescribes guidelines for the denial as an allowance as an administrative expense certain retention bonuses, severance pay, and transfers or obligations incurred for the benefit of officers, managers, or consultants hired after the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition. (Sec. 332) Involuntary Bankruptcy Improvement Act of 2005 - Requires the court, upon motion of an individual debtor, to seal court records relating to an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed against such debtor (including all references to such petition) if the court had dismissed the petition because it was either false, or contained a materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement. Authorizes such court to prohibit consumer reporting agencies from making any consumer report that contains information relating to such petition or to the case commenced by the filing of such petition. Permits the court, upon the motion of the debtor and for good cause, to expunge any records relating to an involuntary bankruptcy petition upon expiration of the statute of limitations governing criminal sanctions for bankruptcy fraud. Title IV: General and Small Business Bankruptcy Provisions - Subtitle A: General Business Bankruptcy Provisions - (Sec. 401) Denies a debtor an automatic stay of: (1) the commencement of an investigation or action by a securities self-regulatory organization to enforce compliance with its regulations; (2) the enforcement of any order or decision obtained by such an organization, other than for monetary sanctions; or (3) any act taken by the securities self-regulatory organization to delist, delete, or refuse to permit quotation of any stock that does not meet applicable regulatory requirements. (Sec. 402) Authorizes the bankruptcy court, upon request of a party in interest, to order that the U.S. trustee not convene a meeting of creditors or equity security holders if the debtor has filed a plan for which acceptances have been solicited before commencement of the case. (Sec. 403) Increases from ten days to 30 days the length of time for the perfection of a transfer of property with respect to a trustee's authority to avoid such a transfer. (Sec. 404) Amends guidelines for rejection and surrender of executory contracts and unexpired leases. (Sec. 405) Authorizes the bankruptcy court, upon request of a party in interest, to order a Chapter 11 trustee to increase the membership of a committee of creditors and equity security holders to include a creditor that is a small business concern following the court's determination that such creditor holds claims of the kind represented by the committee, the aggregate amount of which is disproportionately large in comparison to the creditor's annual gross revenue. Requires such committee to provide access to information to certain creditors who are not committee members. (Sec. 406) Prohibits the bankruptcy trustee from avoiding a warehouseman's lien for costs incidental to the storage and handling of certain goods.
