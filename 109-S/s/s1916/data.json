    "text": "Strengthening America's Security Act of 2005 - Provides for: (1) increases in funding, personnel, and technology at the federal, state, and local level for immigration and border enforcement and visa security, document integrity, immigration fraud, and detention and removal of illegal aliens; and (2) specified border enforcement studies. Sets forth provisions for the release on bond of certain illegal aliens from noncontiguous countries. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to make expedited removal procedures available in all border patrol sectors on the southern U.S. border as soon as operationally possible. Authorizes grants to border-adjacent Indian tribes adversely affected by illegal immigration for law enforcement, health care, environmental restoration, and cultural preservation. Provides for increased detention and federal detention space. Prohibits detention that limits a person's reasonable access to legal counsel. Increases criminal penalties for alien smuggling, document fraud, gang violence, and drug trafficking. Makes an alien inadmissible who: (1) is a member of a street gang; or (2) refuses to comply with a lawful request for biometric data. Continues the institutional removal program (IRP). Establishes in: (1) the Department of Justice an Assistant Attorney General for Immigration Enforcement; and (2) the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Identity and Benefits Fraud Branch of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the Fraud Appellate Review Board, which shall review determinations by the Forensic Document Laboratory determinations of fraudulent documents. Provides for federal reimbursement of state and local costs associated with processing illegal aliens through the criminal justice system."
