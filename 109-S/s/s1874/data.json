    "text": "Alien Tort Statute Reform Act - Amends the federal judicial code to revise the alien tort (injury) statute. Grants exclusive, as well as original, jurisdiction to U.S. district courts over tort claims brought by aliens against U.S. individuals and business entities (e.g., corporations and partnerships). Specifies the torts that are actionable under the Act as torture, extrajudicial killing, genocide, piracy, slavery, or slave trading. Establishes as the legal standard for defendant liability under the Act direct participation with specific intent to commit the alleged tort. Requires courts to decline jurisdiction over an alien tort claim if: (1) the alien claimant has not exhausted adequate and available remedies in the place where the alleged tort occurred; or (2) the President certifies in writing that the exercise of jurisdiction will have a negative impact on U.S. foreign policy interests. Requires claims under the Act to be brought within 10 years from the date of the alleged tort."
