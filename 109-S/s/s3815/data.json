Permits split or shared Medicare billing by physicians and nurse practitioners in SNFs. Amends SSA title XVIII to permit nurse practitioners employed by SNFs to certify skilled care.

Amends SSA title XVIII with respect to: (1) Medicare SNF specific wages; (2) authority to exclude high cost and low probability cancer treatment drugs as well as additional items and services from the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for SNFs; and (4) exclusion of all ambulance services from that PPS. Directs the Secretary to establish a national nursing database to predict future nursing shortages. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require annual reports to the Secretary on nursing levels. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for: (1) a 10-year recovery period for qualified long-term care improvement property; (2) an investment tax credit for long-term care facility information technology; (3) tax-exempt long-term care trust accounts to which an individual may contribute up to $5,000 annually; (4) a refundable tax credit for 10% of annual contributions to such an account; and (5) an income exclusion for certain distributions from such an account for chronically-ill individuals.
