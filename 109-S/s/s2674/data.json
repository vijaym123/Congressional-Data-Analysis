Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to or enter into contracts with such entities to operate Native American Language Survival Schools for Native American children and Native American language-speaking children. Permits the use of grant and contract funds to provide full or partial higher education scholarships and fellowships for the professional development of faculty and staff. Requires the Secretary to make grants or enter into contracts with eligible entities to establish at least four demonstration programs in geographically diverse locations to: (1) provide assistance to schools and nests; and (2) participate in a national study of the linguistic, cultural, and academic effects of schools and nests. Directs the Secretary to provide nests and schools with alternative methods of achieving national education standards with respect to Native American language education."
