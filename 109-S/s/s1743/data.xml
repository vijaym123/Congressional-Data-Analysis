  <summary>9/21/2005--Introduced.
Post-Disaster Consumer Protection Act of 2005 - Makes it unlawful for a supplier to sell, or to offer to sell, any oil or gas product at an unconscionably excessive price ("price gouging") during the 30-day period following declaration of a major disaster by the President. Defines "unconscionably excessive price" as one that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) determines represents a gross disparity between the price charged by a supplier for that product after a major disaster is declared and the average price the supplier charged for that product in the affected area during the 30-day period immediately before the disaster declaration. Empowers the FTC to: (1) treat a violation of this Act as an unfair or deceptive act or practice prohibited under the Federal Trade Commission Act (ACT); and (2) prevent any person from violating this Act in the same manner as provided under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Subjects a violator of this Act to the penalties provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act.</summary>
