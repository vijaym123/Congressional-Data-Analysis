    "text": "Ocean and Coastal Literacy in Urban and other Environments - Amends the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to rename the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology as the National Science and Technology Council. Establishes a National Ocean and Coastal Science Education Task Force to: (1) serve as the primary source of advice on ocean and coastal science education for the Council; and (2) improve cooperation among federal agencies with respect to ocean and coastal sciences and education budgets, programs, operations, facilities, and personnel. Requires the Task Force to maintain an Ocean and Coastal Science Education Advisory Panel. Directs the Task Force to develop a national strategy for ocean and coastal science education and literacy. Establishes an interagency ocean and coastal education program to improve public awareness of the role of the ocean in meeting the Nation's economic, social, and environmental needs. Establishes National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ocean and coastal science education programs, including: (1) a regional elementary and secondary education program; (2) an Ocean and Coastal Literacy in Urban Environments Program (Ocean CLUE Program); (3) an educational partnership program; and (4) the Teacher-at-Sea Program and the Teacher-in-the-Air Program. Requires the Administrator of NOAA to develop a science education plan setting forth NOAA education goals and strategies for the next 20 years. Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to authorize appropriations for estuarine science education for FY2006-FY2011, including: (1) the educational activities of the National Estuarine Research Reserves; and (2) competitive grants for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System system-wide monitoring program data to advance ocean and coastal science literacy."
