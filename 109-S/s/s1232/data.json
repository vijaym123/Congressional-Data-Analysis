    "text": "Fuels Security Act of 2005 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require that motor vehicle fuel contain a specified volume of renewable fuel. Defines \"renewable fuel\" to include motor vehicle fuel that is: (1) produced from grain, starch, or oilseeds; (2) natural biogas; (3) cellulosic biomass fuel; (4) biodiesel; or (5) composed of a mix of components derived from renewable fuel. Establishes a system of: (1) tradeable credits for motor vehicle fuel containing more renewable fuel than required; and (2) waivers of renewable fuel requirements for states and small refineries. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to require federal agency heads to ensure that ethanol-blended gasoline and biodiesel-blended diesel fuel is purchased for agency vehicles in areas where such fuel is available at competitive prices. Amends the Clean Air Act to eliminate the oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline. Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish standards for toxic air pollutants from the use of reformulated gasoline; and (2) within 30 days of enactment of this Act, determine the adequacy of any petition from a state governor to exempt gasoline sold in the state from certain requirements for reformulated gasoline. Permits states additional opt-in areas under the reformulated gasoline program. Requires the Administrator, at the request of a state, to enforce state controls on fuels and fuel additives. Sets forth various data collection and reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary of Energy to provide loan guarantees for demonstration projects to convert celllulosic biomass into ethanol."
