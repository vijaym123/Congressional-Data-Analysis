  <summary>8/3/2006--Introduced.
Protecting Rights of Unknowing Dads and Fostering Access To Help Encourage Responsibility (Proud Father) Act of 2006 - Amends part B (Child and Family Services) of title IV of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) establish and maintain an automated National Putative Father Registry; and (2) only accept authentic requests to search the registry. Prohibits the disclosure of information from the registry if it would contravene a national security interest or if such disclosure would compromise the confidentiality of census data. States that a certificate of search or registration issued by the Secretary serves as rebuttable evidence of efforts to locate a putative father and provide him with notice concerning paternity issues. Requires each putative father to be given notice of: (1) a proceeding concerning a child he has or may have fathered being adopted or entered into state custody; (2) the termination of paternal rights; and (3) the establishment of paternity. Directs the Secretary to establish a nationwide responsible fatherhood and putative father registry educational campaign. Requires the Secretary to make grants to states for assistance in programs concerning: (1) improving the protection of the rights of responsible unwed fathers in legal proceedings; (2) improving the laws involving the abandonment of a child by the biological father; (3) assisting mothers in making plans for their children's future; and (4) protecting the privacy and safety of birth parents. Sets forth state eligibility requirements for the grant program, including providing assurances that the state will put into effect a law that defines what constitutes prebirth abandonment and abandonment subsequent to birth. Provides that any person who knowingly submits false information to a state registry shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, be subject to a fine. Requires the state to establish procedures to ensure that the information maintained in the registry is subject to established privacy safeguards.</summary>
