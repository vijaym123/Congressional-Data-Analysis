Authorizes reopening of a prior fiscal year visa lottery application if: (1) the alien was eligible for, and properly applied for, status adjustment during FY1998-FY2004; (2) the application was denied because the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) failed to adjudicate the application during the fiscal year of application; (3) the alien moves to reopen the application; and (4) the alien has continuously resided in the United States since submitting the application."
