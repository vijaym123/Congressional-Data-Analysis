    "text": "Improving Educational Opportunities for All Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to include as high need local educational agencies (LEAs), for purposes of teacher quality enhancement grants, LEAs that serve an elementary school or secondary school located in an area in which there is a rural population or a high percentage of minority students, students with limited English proficiency, or Native American students. Revises an HEA program for Hispanic-serving institutions to eliminate: (1) a requirement that such institutions provide assurances that at least 50% of their Hispanic students are low-income individuals; and (2) a two-year wait-out period between grants (thus permitting such an institution to apply for a subsequent five-year grant award immediately after the expiration of its most recent five-year award)."
