    "text": "Oil Pollution Prevention and Response Act of 2006 - Requires a: (1) report on the status of specified Coast Guard rulemakings; and (2) final rule in each pending rulemaking under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Establishes certain guidelines for the promulgation of safety standards for towing vessels. Requires all U.S. and foreign-flag tank vessels that enter a U.S. port to be Coast Guard (CG) inspected for potential risk of an oil spill. Requires promulgation of regulations to reduce the risks of oil spills involving the transfer of oil from or to a tank vessel. Requires the CG to: (1) identify the types of human errors that cause oil spills and near-miss oil spill incidents; and (2) promulgate regulations designed to reduce the risks of oil spills from human errors. Requires the CG to improve its coordination with tribal governments of federally-recognized Indian tribes with respect to oil spill prevention, preparedness, and response. Codifies into federal law the establishment of the Oil Spill Advisory Council. Requires completion of the electronic navigation chart suite for all U.S. coastal waters. Requires a rapid response system to collect and predict in situ information about oil spill behavior. Increases maximum liability amounts for tank and other vessels or offshore facilities (other than deepwater ports) for removal costs and damages incurred with respect to the discharge of oil into U.S. waters or upon adjoining shorelines. Makes owners of oil (in addition to vessel owners) transported in single hull tank vessels liable for such costs and damages after December 31, 2010. Requires the stationing of a rescue tug in the entry to the Strait of Juan de Fuca near Neah Bay. Establishes the Federal Oil Spill Research Committee. Establishes a grant program for research, development, and demonstration of new technologies to prevent, detect, or mitigate oil discharges and to protect the environment."
