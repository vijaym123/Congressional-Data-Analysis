Makes exceptions for any incentive that: (1) is dependent upon State or country of incorporation, commercial domicile, or residence of an individual; (2) requires the recipient to acquire, lease, license, use, or provide services to property created in the State; (3) is reduced or eliminated as a result of an increase in out-of-State activity by the recipient or other person or as a result of such other person not having a taxable presence in the State; (4) results in loss of a compensating tax system, because the tax on interstate commerce exceeds the tax on intrastate commerce; (5) requires that other taxing jurisdictions offer reciprocal tax benefits; or (6) requires that a tax incentive earned with respect to one tax can only be used to reduce a tax burden for, or provide a tax benefit against any other tax that is not imposed on, apportioned interstate activities."
