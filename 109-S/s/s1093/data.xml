Research and Development Investment Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to: (1) direct the Secretary of Energy, if there are insufficient appropriations in any given year, to assign 60 percent of appropriated funds under the renewable energy production incentive program to facilities that use solar, wind, geothermal, or closed-loop biomass to generate electricity; (2) redefine "qualified renewable energy facility"; (3) extend the eligibility period for payments under the program through FY2015; (4) include landfill gas as a renewable energy resource; and (5) extend the termination date and program funding through FY2025. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) extend the tax credit for production of electricity from certain renewable resources until 2011; (2) include incremental geothermal and hydropower facilities as qualified energy resources for purposes of such credit; (3) allow a tax credit for 10 percent of residential solar and geothermal energy property expenditures; and (4) delay the phaseout of the tax deduction for clean-fuel vehicles and the tax credit for qualified electric vehicles until 2006.</summary>
