Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) extend the tax credit for production of electricity from certain renewable resources until 2011; (2) include incremental geothermal and hydropower facilities as qualified energy resources for purposes of such credit; (3) allow a tax credit for 10 percent of residential solar and geothermal energy property expenditures; and (4) delay the phaseout of the tax deduction for clean-fuel vehicles and the tax credit for qualified electric vehicles until 2006."
