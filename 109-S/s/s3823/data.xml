  <summary>8/3/2006--Introduced.
Civil Rights Restoration Act of 2006 - Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to provide that a state's receipt or use of federal financial assistance for a program or activity shall constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity to a suit brought by a person aggrieved by that program or activity (or alleging a violation of ADA) for equitable, legal, or other relief authorized by or through such Acts. Abrogates a state's sovereign immunity for any suit brought by a person for such authorized relief for conduct that violates the 14th amendment and that also violates either such Act.</summary>
