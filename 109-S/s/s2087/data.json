    "text": "Agricultural Employment and Workforce Protection Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) prepare and submit to Congress a comprehensive plan, including detailed strategies, timelines, and estimated costs, to establish operational control of U.S. borders and effectively enforce immigration laws within the United States; (2) develop a plan for using Department of Defense (DOD) equipment for surveillance of U.S. international land borders; and (3) increase the number of full-time Customs and Border Protection Officers. Authorizes the Secretary to construct additional land ports of entry to enhance U.S. border security. Authorizes state or local law enforcement officials to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to: (1) require the Secretary to accept custody of illegal aliens held by state or local law enforcement officials; (2) reimburse states and local governments for the costs of holding and transporting such aliens; and (3) make aliens who are members of criminal street gangs ineligible for admission to the United States.Requires the Secretary to: (1) hire additional personnel to investigate immigration status violations; (2) provide the National Crime Information Center with information on certain classes of illegal aliens; and (3) build or acquire additional alien detention facilities. Amends the INA to: (1) revise requirements for the H-2A visa (temporary agricultural workers); (2) establish a cross-border commuter worker program (H-2AA) to allow Canadian and Mexican workers to enter and exit the United States for work purposes each day; and (3) establish a blue card program for undocumented agricultural workers who have at least 1600 hours of agricultural employment in the United States in 2005 and have no criminal record. Allows such workers to work in the United States for two years."
