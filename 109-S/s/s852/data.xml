  <summary>6/16/2005--Reported to Senate amended.
Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005 or the FAIR Act of 2005 - Title I: Asbestos Claims Resolution - Subtitle A: Office of Asbestos Disease Compensation - (Sec. 101) Establishes in the Department of Labor the Office of Asbestos Disease Compensation (Office), to be headed by an Administrator who is appointed by the President and who is responsible for processing claims for asbestos-related illnesses and paying compensation to eligible claimants. Declares that the purpose of such Office is to provide timely, fair compensation to claimants whose health has been adversely affected by exposure to asbestos, on a no-fault basis and in a non-adversarial manner. Terminates the Office not later than 12 months after certification by the Administrator that the Office has neither paid a claim in the previous 12 months nor has debt obligations remaining to pay. Limits the term of the Administrator to five years. Requires the Administrator to report directly to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Employment Standards Administration. Sets forth the specific duties of the Administrator. Makes the Freedom of Information Act applicable to the Office and the Asbestos Insurers Commission. Sets forth procedures to protect the confidentiality of claimants' financial and medical records. (Sec. 102) Directs the Administrator to establish an Advisory Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation (Advisory Committee). Provides that the Advisory Committee shall consist of 20 members appointed by the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate and the Speaker and the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives and the Administrator. Directs the Advisory Committee to advise the Administrator on asbestos disease compensation matters, including: (1) claims filing and claims processing procedures; (2) claimant assistance programs; and (3) audit procedures and quality control programs. (Sec. 103) Directs the Administrator to establish a Medical Advisory Committee to provide expert medical advice. (Sec. 104) Requires the Administrator to establish a comprehensive asbestos claimant assistance program, including a program to provide legal assistance to asbestos claimants. (Sec. 105) Requires the Administrator to establish physician panels for the purposes of making medical determinations and assisting in other functions as required by this Act. Exempts such panels from the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. (Sec. 106) Requires the Administrator to promulgate interim regulations for the processing of claims, including procedures for expediting exigent health claims and for processing claims through a claims facility. Includes extreme financial hardship as a basis for an exigent health claim. Stays any asbestos claim pending in a state or federal court on the date of enactment of this Act, unless the presentation of evidence has begun before a jury or judge, or a verdict, final order, or final judgment has been entered by a trial court. Sets forth procedures for the settlement of exigent health claims (claims by mesothelioma patients, by patients with a life expectancy of less than one year, or by relatives of individuals who have died from asbestos disease after the enactment of this Act). Allows asbestos claimants to file non-exigent claims in federal or state court if the Administrator cannot certify to Congress that the Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution Fund is operational and paying claims within 24 months after the enactment of this Act. (Sec. 107) Authorizes the Administrator to issue witness subpoenas, administer oaths, examine witnesses, require the production of books and records, and request assistance from other federal agencies. Subtitle B: Asbestos Disease Compensation Procedures - (Sec. 111) Requires that all claims for asbestos disease compensation be filed in a timely manner and be proven by a preponderance of evidence. (Sec. 112) Exempts claimants from the necessity of proving that their asbestos-related injuries resulted from the negligence or fault of any other person. (Sec. 113) Sets forth procedures for the filing of claims, including claims for multiple injuries and additional awards. Requires claimants to file claims within five years of an initial medical diagnosis. Sets forth special procedures for Libby, Montana, asbestos claims. (Sec. 114) Requires the Administrator to determine whether a claim for asbestos disease filed under this Act meets certain eligibility requirements and to make a proposed decision on any claim within 90 days after such claim is filed. Allows payments on any claim for which the Administrator fails to make a proposed decision within 180 days after such claim is filed.
