Defines \"responsible party\" as a corporation: (1) that has engaged in mining vermiculite that was contaminated by tremolite asbestos; (2) whose officers or directors have been indicted for knowingly releasing asbestos into the ambient air and knowingly endangering the residents of Libby, Montana, and the surrounding communities; and (3) for which the Department of Justice has intervened in a bankruptcy proceeding. Requires any payment received by the United States for recovery of costs associated with the actions to address asbestos contamination in Libby, Montana, to be deposited into such fund. Sets eligibility criteria for medical benefit payments from the fund."
