Makes the provisions of this section effective on the date of enactment of this Act, and applicable to acts occurring on or after such date. States that specified amendments made by of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to the definition of aggravated felony shall continue to apply whether the conviction was entered before, on, or after September 30, 1996. (Sec. 204) Amends the definition of \"good moral character\" to: (1) exclude any alien inadmissible for terrorism and security-related reasons; (2) provide that the aggravated felony bar to good moral character applies regardless of when the crime was classified as an aggravated felony unless the term of imprisonment was completed no later than ten years before the naturalization application date; and (3) provide the Secretary and the Attorney General with discretionary authority to find an alien not to be of good moral character. Prohibits approval of an immigrant visa petition if there is a pending proceeding against the petitioner that could result in denaturalization or the loss of permanent resident status. Requires that specified conditional permanent residents have the conditions on their residence removed before they can be naturalized. Revises provisions respecting district court review of denied naturalization applications. Sets a 120-day time limit to seek review. Bars an alien: (1) removable on terrorist or security grounds from becoming naturalized; and (2) from being naturalized while in removal or denaturalization proceedings. Limits district court jurisdiction in cases of delay to a review of the delay's basis and remand of the matter with instructions to the Secretary. Makes the provisions of this section effective on the date of enactment of this Act, and applicable to acts occurring on or after such date. (Sec. 205) Makes an alien inadmissible or deportable (provides the Secretary and the Attorney General with waiver authority) if the Attorney General or the Secretary (or a consular officer regarding inadmissibility) knows or has reason to believe that such alien: (1) is or has been a member of a criminal street gang; or (2) has participated in a criminal street gang's activities, knowing or having reason to know that such activities furthered the criminal gang's illegal activity. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) terminate or modify temporary protected status for any reason, including national security, immediately upon publication of notice in the Federal Register; and (2) detain an alien provided temporary protected status whenever appropriate under any other provision of law. Increases penalties and sets mandatory minimum sentences for an alien who fails to depart when ordered removed, hampers removal, or fails to present himself or herself for removal. Authorizes the Secretary to instruct the Department of State to deny visas to individuals from a country that has denied or unreasonably delayed acceptance of a citizen, national, or resident of that country who has been ordered removed from United States until the country accepts such individual. Revises alien smuggling and related offense provisions to expand the scope of activities included in such offense, including transporting or harboring a person outside the United States under circumstances in which such person is seeking to unlawfully enter the United States.
