Provides for administrative enforcement of such Act through the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or other regulatory agencies, and allows a private cause of action by the aggrieved servicemember or dependent. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to provide to each member under their jurisdiction pertinent information on the rights and protections available to servicemembers and their dependents under such Act. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to provide such information to affected adult dependents. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to require the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide a servicemember homeowner with an explanation of servicemember and dependent mortgage and foreclosure rights under such Act."
