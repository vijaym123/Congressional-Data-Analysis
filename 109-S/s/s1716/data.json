    "text": "Emergency Health Care Relief Act of 2005 - Requires a state to provide medical assistance to eligible Hurricane Katrina survivors under a state Medicaid plan. Increases the federal medical assistance percentage for providing medical assistance under a state Medicaid plan to any individual residing in certain affected areas of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Amends title XI of the Social Security Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain requirements in any geographical area in which there are a significant number of evacuees from an emergency area. Establishes the Disaster Relief Fund for payments to: (1) Medicaid providers to offset costs incurred by such providers as a result of Hurricane Katrina; and (2) state insurance commissioners for making payments to health insurance issuers for health insurance premiums for eligible individuals or qualified employers. Amends the TANF Emergency Response and Recovery Act of 2005 to revise the definition of \"needy state\" for purposes of Temporary Assistance for Needy Family (TANF) block grants to include any direct impact states and any other states that provide benefits or services to a family that resided in a direct impact state and traveled to the state as a result of the hurricane. Increases the maximum amount of all TANF loans that can be made to a state. Allows the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, or Alabama to enter into and participate in an agreement with the Secretary of Labor to make payments of temporary extended unemployment compensation to individuals who are not otherwise entitled to such compensation. Authorizes modifications to procurement procedures as necessary for the support of Hurricane Katrina rescue and relief operations."
