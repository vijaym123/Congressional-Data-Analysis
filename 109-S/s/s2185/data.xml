  <summary>1/25/2006--Introduced.
IDEA Full Funding Act - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to reauthorize part B programs of education of all children with disabilities. Authorizes appropriations for part B: (1) for FY2007-FY2011 in specified amounts; and (2) for FY2012 and each fiscal year thereafter in an amount equal to the sum of the maximum amounts of the grants all states may receive under certain IDEA provisions. (Provides phased-in increases of such authorized funding designed to reach a promised 40% federal share by FY2011.) Makes appropriations for part B for FY2007-FY2011, as well as for FY2012 and each fiscal year thereafter, in amounts less than those this Act authorizes to be appropriated.</summary>
