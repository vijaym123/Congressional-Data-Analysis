  <summary>4/27/2006--Introduced.
Los Angeles River Revitalization Act - Directs the Secretary of the Army, in coordination with the City of Los Angeles, to submit a project-specific plan for the revitalization of the Los Angeles River that is consistent with the goals of the Los Angeles River Revitalization Master Plan. Directs the Secretary to offer to enter into a binding agreement with the City and any other non-federal sponsor to carry out the plan and to pay at least 50% of the costs. Authorizes the Secretary to recommend any locally-preferred project as an alternative to a measure proposed in the plan. Requires each such project to be included in the feasibility report or in an environmental impact statement or analysis. Authorizes the Secretary to construct a pilot project to provide information to develop the plan. Directs the Secretary to: (1) offer to enter into a binding agreement with the City and any other non-federal sponsor to carry out each such pilot project and to pay at least 35% of the costs; and (2) assign a priority to each project. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1992 to authorize appropriations for a Los Angeles River water reuse project, including measures for environmental restoration and revitalization.</summary>
