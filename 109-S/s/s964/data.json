    "text": "Americans Outdoors Act of 2005 - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to require the transfer of qualified outer continental shelf revenues from the Treasury to specified programs. Rewrites coastal impact assistance program provisions to set forth new formulas for allocating amounts transferred for coastal impact assistance payments among producing States (coastal States within a specified distance from qualified Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas drilling leases) and among coastal political subdivisions. Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (LWCFA) to: (1) establish a new formula for apportioning outdoor conservation and recreation funds to the States (including U.S. territories and the District of Columbia); (2) make Indian tribes eligible for funds under a competitive grants program established by the Secretary of the Interior; and (3) require States to allocate a percentage of their annual apportionment to localities. Requires States seeking LWCFA funds to develop State action agendas. Amends the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to establish a new formula for apportioning Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account funds to include apportionments to Indian tribes. Amends the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 to: (1) include among that Act's purposes the development of new recreation areas and facilities; and (2) address the treatment of funds transferred under OCSLA."
