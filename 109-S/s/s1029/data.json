Requires partnerships for the award of grants between a state agency and: (1) at least one public and one private degree granting institution of higher education located in the state; and (2) new or existing early information and intervention, mentoring, or outreach programs also located in the state. Permits partnerships with philanthropic organizations located in, or which provide funding in, the state, as well as private corporations located in, or doing business in, the state. Requires different federal shares of program costs and different amounts of grants awarded in partnerships with institutions of higher learning: (1) serving less than a majority of students in the state; and (2) serving the majority of students in the state. Requires annual early notification of low-income students of their potential eligibility for student financial assistance. Prescribes minimum eligibility requirements for such students."
