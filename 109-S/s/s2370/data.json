    "text": "Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 - (Sec. 2) States that it shall be U.S. policy to: (1) support a peaceful, two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians in accordance with the Performance-Based Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (Roadmap), and oppose those organizations, individuals, and countries that support terrorism and violently reject such two-state solution; (2) promote democracy and the cessation of terrorism and incitement in institutions and territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority (PA); and (3) urge members of the international community to avoid contact with and refrain from financially supporting the terrorist organization Hamas until it agrees to recognize Israel, renounce violence, disarm, and accept prior agreements, including the Roadmap. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide assistance under such Act to the Hamas-controlled PA only during a period for which a presidential certification has determined that: (1) no PA ministry, agency, or instrumentality is controlled by Hamas unless the Hamas-controlled PA has publicly acknowledged the Jewish state of Israel's right to exist and is adhering to all previous agreements and understandings with the United States, Israel, and the international community, including agreements and understandings pursuant to the Roadmap; and (2) the Hamas-controlled PA has made demonstrable progress toward purging from its security services individuals with ties to terrorism, dismantling all terrorist infrastructure and cooperating with Israel's security services, halting anti-American and anti-Israel incitement, and ensuring democracy and financial transparency. Directs the President to make and transmit such recertifications to Congress every six months (except for the first recertification which must be made within 90 days of the initial certification). States that assistance to the PA may not be provided until 15 days after the date on which the President has provided notice to the Committees on International Relations and on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and to the Committees on Foreign Relations and on Appropriations of the Senate (Committees) in accordance with specified reprogramming notification provisions under such Act. Exempts from such limitation, upon certification to Congress, assistance for: (1) administrative and personal security costs of the Office of the President of the PA; (2) activities of the President of the PA to fulfill his or her duties as President, including controlling border crossings, fostering the Middle East peace process, and promoting democracy and the rule of law; and (3) the judiciary branch of the PA and other entities.
