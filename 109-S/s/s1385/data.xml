  <summary>7/12/2005--Introduced.
Fair Treatment and Due Process Protection Act of 2005 - Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require a state to which a family assistance grant is made to provide appropriate interpretation and translation services to individuals who lack English proficiency if the number or percentage of persons lacking English proficiency meets certain standards. Provides for a reduced family assistance grant as a penalty for states failing to provide such services. Requires a pre-sanction review process. Provides for a similar penalty for states not following such process. Revises data collection and reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) conduct longitudinal studies of a representative sample of families that receive TANF assistance; and (2) ensure that public disclosure with respect to any information concerning TANF recipients or applicants is made in a manner that protects their privacy.</summary>
