Defines prompt payment as within 14 days from submission for claims submitted electronically, and within 30 days for claims submitted otherwise. Requires payment of interest, also, if a payment is not issued, mailed, or otherwise transmitted within the applicable number of calendar days. Prohibits a Medicare prescription drug card issued by a prescription drug plan sponsor from displaying the name, brand, or trademark (co-branding) of any pharmacy. Revises requirements for a covered medication therapy management program, allowing it to be furnished by a health care provider, other than a pharmacist, with advanced training in medication management. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to specify: (1) the population of part D eligible individuals appropriate for services under a medication therapy management program, based on certain characteristics; and (2) a minimum defined package of medication therapy management services that shall be provided to each enrollee. Revises requirements for pharmacy fees. Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a two-year demonstration program to examine the impact of medication therapy management furnished by a pharmacist in a community-based or ambulatory-based setting on quality of care, spending, and patient health; and (2) a Best Practices Commission to develop a best practices model for medication therapy management."
