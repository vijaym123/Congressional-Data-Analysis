Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act of 2006 - Title I: Bilateral Action on Addressing Urgent Needs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - (Sec. 102) Sets forth specified U.S. political, social, civil, and economic policy objectives (policy objectives) with respect to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). (Sec. 103) Obligates a specified minimum amount for each of FY2006-FY2007 under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, and the Arms Export Control Act for bilateral assistance programs in the DRC. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of State should submit budget requests in FY2008-FY2009 that contain appropriate bilateral assistance increases for the DRC if progress is being made toward accomplishing the policy objectives. States that the United States should work with other donor nations to increase international contributions to the DRC. (Sec. 104) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the government of the DRC must be committed to achieving the policy objectives if U.S. and international efforts are to be effective in bringing relief, security, and democracy to the country; (2) the government of the DRC should exercise control over its Armed Forces, stop the mass rapes by its armed forces, and hold those responsible accountable before an appropriate tribunal; (3) the government of the DRC, in collaboration with international aid agencies, should establish expert teams to assess the health, counseling, and social support needs of such victims; and (4) the international community is providing substantial funding that is giving the government of the DRC an opportunity to make progress towards the policy objectives but this assistance cannot continue in perpetuity. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should withhold assistance if the government of the DRC is not making sufficient progress towards accomplishing the policy objectives. (Sec. 105) Authorizes the Secretary to withhold assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, other than humanitarian, peacekeeping, and counterterrorism assistance, for a foreign country determined by the Secretary to be acting to destabilize the DRC. (Sec. 106) Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress respecting progress made toward accomplishing the policy objectives, including an evaluation of related U.S. policies and foreign assistance programs. (Sec. 107) States that the President should appoint a Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region to help coordinate efforts to resolve the instability and insecurity in Eastern Congo. Title II: Multilateral Actions to Address Urgent Needs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - (Sec. 201) States that the United States should use its influence in the U.N. Security Council to: (1) address exploitation at the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC); (2) conclude a Memorandum of Understanding relating to binding codes of conduct and programs for the prevention of sexual abuse and trafficking in persons to be undertaken by the United Nations for all countries that contribute troops to MONUC; (3) strengthen MONUC; (4) ensure that the recruiting and arming of children in the DRC is halted; (5) strengthen the arms embargo; (6) allow for more effective protection of natural resources in the DRC, especially in the eastern part of the country; (7) press countries in the Congo region to help facilitate an end to the violence in the DRC; and (8) encourage the U.N. Secretary-General to become more involved in completing the policy objectives and ensure that fighting in North Kivu, Ituri, and other areas does not create widespread instability throughout the country. (Sec. 202) States that the President should use U.S. influence to support increased international humanitarian and development assistance for the DRC. States that if the Secretary determines that the government of the DRC is not making sufficient progress towards accomplishing the policy objectives the President shall consider withdrawing U.S. support for such international assistance when future funding decisions are considered.</summary>
