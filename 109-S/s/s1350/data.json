Requires a provider to remove the wireless number of any subscriber from a WDAS upon request of that subscriber and without subscriber cost. Provides limited circumstances under which a provider may connect a calling party from a WDAS to a commercial mobile service subscriber. Prohibits a telecommunications carrier from disclosing in billing information provided to customers wireless numbers of subscribers who have indicated a preference to their provider for not having their wireless number disclosed. Prohibits a provider from publishing (listing) in any form, selling, or otherwise distributing the contents of any WDAS database unless the provider: (1) notifies the subscriber of the right not to be listed; and (2) obtains express prior authorization for listing from such subscriber, and that authorization has not been withdrawn. Prohibits a provider from charging a subscriber for the exercise of any rights under this Act."
