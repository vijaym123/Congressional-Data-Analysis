Prescribes special rules for calculating the Medicare hospital outpatient department (OPD) fee schedule amounts for clinic and emergency department visits. Extends from temporary to permanent the current adjustment to payments (hold harmless provisions) for certain small rural and sole community hospitals under the OPD prospective payment system (PPS). Eliminates the cap on the Medicare disproportionate share hospital (DSH) adjustment for payments to rural hospitals."
