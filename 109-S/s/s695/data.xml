  <summary>11/16/2005--Passed Senate without amendment.
New Shipper Review Amendment Act of 2005 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 with respect to reviews by the administering authority to establish an individual weighted average dumping margin or an individual countervailing duty rate (as the case may be) for a new exporter or producer that: (1) did not export the merchandise that was the subject of an antidumping duty or countervailing duty order to the United States during the period of investigation; and (2) was not affiliated with any exporter or producer who did. Suspends for three years the requirement that the administering authority direct the Customs Service to allow, at the option of the importer of such merchandise, the posting, until completion of the review, of a bond or security in lieu of a cash deposit for each entry of the subject merchandise (bonding privileges). Requires the Secretary of Commerce to report to specified congressional committees on: (1) recommendations on whether the effectiveness of the suspension should be extended beyond such date; and (2) assessments of the effectiveness of any administrative measures that have been implemented to address the difficulties giving rise to the suspension, including problems in assuring the collection of antidumping duties on imports from new shippers, administrative burdens imposed on the Department of Commerce by new shipper reviews, and the use of the bonding privilege by exporters from new shippers to circumvent the effect of antidumping duty orders.</summary>
