Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve Boundary Adjustment Act of 2005 - Amends the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 to: (1) adjust the boundary of the Barataria Preserve Unit of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve in Louisiana by increasing the acreage limitation; and (2) authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire any such additional land, water, and interests in land and water by donation, purchase, transfer from any other federal agency, or exchange. Requires, with respect to the Bayou aux Carpes Addition and the CIT Tract Addition, any federal land acquired in such Additions to be transferred without consideration to the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service. Permits the acquisition of any private land in those Additions only with the owner's consent. Subjects any federal land in the CIT Tract Addition to any easements that have been agreed to by the Secretary and the Secretary of the Army. Modifies and/or eliminates certain provisions related to the acquisition of property within the Unit. Permits hunting, fishing, and trapping within the Unit. (Current law excludes such activities within the core area of the Unit and on certain lands acquired by the Secretary within the Unit.) Continues to provide for the designation of zones where, and established periods when, no hunting, fishing, or trapping shall be permitted except for public safety reasons.</summary>
