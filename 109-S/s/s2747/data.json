Provides assistance to states to: (1) retire fuel-inefficient motor vehicles; and (2) reduce school bus idling. Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) conduct a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application for electric drive transportation technology; and (2) establish a research and development program for lightweight materials research and vehicle weight reduction. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to: (1) provide loan guarantees for fuel-efficient automobile manufacturers and suppliers; and (2) require that the federal government consume specified amounts of renewable energy. Establishes the Alternative Fueling Infrastructure Trust Fund. Directs the Secretary to: (1) deploy new technologies to reduce oil use in transportation, including fuel from cellulosic biomass; (2) competitively award financial incentives for the manufacture of high-efficiency consumer products; and (3) conduct a national media campaign to decrease oil and natural gas consumption. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to: (1) set forth a federal renewable portfolio standard; and (2) require state regulatory authorities to implement energy efficiency resource programs that include electric utilities and gas utilities.
