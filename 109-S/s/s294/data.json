Provides that if the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate officials in such a minimal risk region, determines that the region is in full compliance with a ruminant feed ban and other BSE safeguards, the Secretary: (1) shall report to specified congressional committees on the determination; and (2) may promulgate regulations to allow such rules to apply to meat, meat byproducts, and meat food products derived from a class of bovines in the region that is determined by the Secretary by the regulations."
