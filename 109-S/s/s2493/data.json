Requires such institutions to: (1) record all on-campus fires, including the nature, date, time, and general location of each fire and all false fire alarms; and (2) open such information to public inspection. Requires the institutions to report on such information annually to the campus community in a manner that will aid the prevention of similar occurrences. Requires the institutions to request their fraternities and sororities to collect and report such information for each building and property they own or control. Requires the Secretary of Education to report to Congress on fire safety systems in facilities of institutions of higher education and on fire safety standards in all such facilities."
