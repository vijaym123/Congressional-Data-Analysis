Defines \"family abduction\" as the taking, keeping, or concealing of a child by a parent or other family member to prevent another individual from exercising lawful custody or visitation rights. Requires that not less than 50% of the cost of a project for which a grant is made under this Act be provided by non-federal sources. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2010."
