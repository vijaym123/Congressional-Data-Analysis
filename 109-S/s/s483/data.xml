  <summary>3/1/2005--Introduced.
Amends the Equal Access Act to include coverage of public elementary schools. (The Act currently prohibits public secondary schools, if they receive Federal funds and if they offer a limited public forum, from denying equal access or a fair opportunity to, or discriminating against, any students who wish to conduct a meeting within that limited open forum on the basis of the religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the speech at such meetings.)</summary>
