  <summary>7/28/2005--Introduced.
Public Land Protection and Conservation Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide grants to: (1) states to carry out assessment projects consistent with relevant state invasive species management plans to identify invasive species that occur in the state, including methods to control or detect incipient infestations, or control or assess established populations, of invasive species in the state; and (2) appropriate public or private entities and Indian tribes to carry out, in partnership with a federal agency, control projects for the management or eradication of invasive species on public land. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to states, local governments, nongovernmental entities, and Indian tribes to rapidly respond to outbreaks of invasive species that are at a stage at which rapid eradication or control is possible. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to submit to Congress a budget analysis of federal programs relating to invasive species, including a list of general priorities of federal efforts and programs in prevention, detection, eradication, and control of such species.</summary>
