    "text": "Central Nevada Rural Cemeteries Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, to convey to Lander County, Nevada, for no consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the National Forest System land (including any improvements on such land) known as Kingston Cemetery. Directs the Secretary to grant the County an easement allowing access for persons wanting to visit the Cemetery and other cemetery purposes over Forest Development Road #20307B, notwithstanding any future closing of the road for other use. Requires Lander County (including its successors) to continue using the land as a cemetery. Provides that, if the Secretary, after notice to the County and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a finding that the County has used or permitted the use of the land for any other purpose, and the County fails to discontinue that use: (1) title to the land shall revert to the Secretary, to be administered by the Secretary, and (2) the easement granted to the County shall be revoked. Permits the Secretary to waive the application of the reversion of the title to the land or the revocation of the easement if a waiver would be in the best interests of the United States. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, to convey to Eureka County, Nevada, for no consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the public land (including any improvements on such land) known as Maiden's Grave Cemetery. Directs the Secretary to grant the County an easement allowing access for persons wanting to visit the Cemetery and other cemetery purposes over an appropriate access route consistent with current access. Requires Eureka County (including its successors) to continue using the land as a cemetery. Provides for the reversion and waiver provisions specified above to apply to such County as well."
