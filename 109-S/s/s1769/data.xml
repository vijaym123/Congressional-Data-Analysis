  <summary>9/26/2005--Introduced.
Public Health and Health Insurance Emergency Response Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to modify certain requirements during a declared public health emergency, including by: (1) extending deadlines for administrative reporting; (2) waiving matching funds requirements; and (3) waiving health care professionals' licensing requirements. Allows the Secretary to: (1) extend temporary assistance in meeting health emergencies to 18 months (currently, such assistance is limited to six months); and (2) temporarily provide reimbursements (at the same rate provided to qualified health centers) to any health center or facility providing primary and preventive care that treats individuals displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Amends the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 to provide, in the event of a major disaster and declared public health emergency, for the establishment of a registry to identify and maintain information about individuals with disabilities in emergency shelters and assure that such individuals are receiving necessary services and support. Requires the Secretary to provide for an immediate and independent review of the lessons learned from the federal, state, and local public health, mental health, and medical care planning and preparedness for, and response to, Hurricane Katrina. Requires the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct an audit and investigation of Hurricane Katrina related programs of HHS. Requires the Secretary to establish a program to provide emergency health coverage continuation relief through the provision of direct payments of health insurance premiums on behalf of eligible businesses and their employees and purchasers of individual health insurance coverage.</summary>
