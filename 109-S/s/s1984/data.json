    "text": "Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act - Establishes the Intellectual Property Enforcement Network, consisting of specified representatives of various government agencies, to: (1) establish policies, objectives, and priorities concerning international intellectual property protection and law enforcement; (2) protect U.S. intellectual property rights overseas, including by creating an international task force; and (3) coordinate and oversee implementation of such policies, objectives, and priorities by relevant agencies. Requires the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to: (1) provide information to members and employees of the Network with appropriate security clearance; and (2) assign CIA employees to work on achieving suchpolicies, objectives, and priorities. Requires the agencies in the Network to: (1) share the information they collect; (2) coordinate civil and criminal actions related to intellectual property rights; (3) establish formal processes for working with state and local government agencies and consulting with companies, labor unions, writers, artists, and other interested persons and groups; and (4) consult with the Register of Copyrights on law enforcement matters. Urges the President and relevant agency officers, when meeting with certain foreign countries, to stress the importance of establishing and participating in the international task force. Calls for other government intellectual property initiatives to be consolidated into the work of the Network to prevent duplication. Amends the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2000 to repeal provisions establishing the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council."
