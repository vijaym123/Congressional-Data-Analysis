  <summary>11/7/2005--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that the conferees for any budget reconciliation bill of the 109th Congress shall not report a reconciliation bill that would with respect to low-income children, pregnant women, disabled individuals, elderly individuals, individuals with chronic illnesses like HIV/AIDS, cancer, and diabetes, individuals with mental illnesses, and other Medicaid beneficiaries: (1) impair access to Medicaid services; (2) undermine eligibility for such beneficiaries; (3) make Medicaid services unaffordable, hence unavailable, to them; or (4) cut health care services them. Expresses the sense of the Senate, also, that the conferees shall not report a reconciliation bill that would undermine the federal guarantee of health insurance coverage that the Medicaid program provides, which would threaten not only the health care safety net of the United States, but the entire health care system of the United States.</summary>
