  <summary>2/8/2005--Introduced.
Reasonable Notice and Search Act - Revises provisions governing search warrants authorized under the USA PATRIOT ACT to: (1) limit the authority to delay notice of the issuance of such a search warrant to circumstances where providing immediate notice of the warrant will endanger the life or physical safety of an individual or result in flight from prosecution, the destruction of or tampering with the evidence sought under the warrant, or intimidation of potential witnesses; and (2) require such delayed notification to be issued within seven days (currently, within a "reasonable period") after execution, with extensions by the court for additional periods of up to seven calendar days each time that the court finds reasonable cause to believe that notice of the execution of the warrant would have such consequences. Requires the Attorney General, on a semiannual basis, to transmit to Congress and make public a report concerning all requests for delays of notice and for extensions of such delays. Sunsets the delayed notice authority on December 31, 2005.</summary>
