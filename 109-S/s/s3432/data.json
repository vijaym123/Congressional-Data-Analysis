    "text": "Project Safe Childhood Act - Directs the Attorney General to create a program for: (1) integrated federal, state, and local investigation and prosecution of child exploitation; (2) major case coordination by the Department of Justice or other federal agencies; (3) increased federal involvement in child pornography and enticement cases; (4) training of federal, state, and local law enforcement; and (5) community awareness and educational programs. Allows use of funds authorized under these provisions for the program and for: (1) at least 8 more Assistant U.S. Attorneys dedicated to program prosecutions; (2) at least 10 new Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task forces and enhancement of existing ICAC task forces' forensic capacities; (3) development and enhancement of the Innocent Images task forces; and (4) other additional and related purposes as the Attorney General determines appropriate. Amends the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to increase fines for willful failure of electronic communications service providers to report child pornography. Imposes on those providers and remote computing services providers new fines for negligent failure to report. Requires commercial websites to have Federal Trade Commission-prescribed warnings on pages with sexually explicit material. Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit the use of deceptive wording or images to deceive persons into viewing obscenity on the Internet or deceive a minor into viewing Internet material harmful to minors. Increases criminal penalties for specified matters related to sex, nudity, pornography, or excretion. Authorizes public awareness campaigns to: (1) better protect children when on the Internet; and (2) encourage better use of federal and state sex offender registries. Directs the Attorney General to make grants to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations for programs to keep children safe when on the internet."
