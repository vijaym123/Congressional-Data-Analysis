Requires mandatory investigations of a transaction involving an entity controlled by or acting on behalf of a foreign person other than a foreign government only in the case in which the transaction involves critical infrastructure and could affect U.S. national security. States that the President's designee, for purposes of such investigations, shall be the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)."
