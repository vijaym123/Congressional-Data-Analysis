Requires the study to also address whether FOIA fees and fee waivers need to be reformed. Requires the Commission to submit study results and recommendations to Congress and the President within one year. Directs the heads of executive agencies, the Government Accountability Office, and the Congressional Research Service to provide the Commission with information needed by the Commission to carry out its functions.
