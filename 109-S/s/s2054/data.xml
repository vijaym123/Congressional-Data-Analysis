Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, to study and report to specified congressional committees on water resources in Vermont. Requires the study to include: (1) a survey of groundwater supplies available for potable use by municipalities, groundwater availability, potability, potential to recharge, and interaction with surface water; (2) a survey of potential future water supply sources; and (3) a characterization of surface and bedrock geology, including its effect on groundwater yield and quality. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to reduce the total cost and the estimated first federal cost for the authorized navigation project, Norfolk Harbor and Channels, Virginia.</summary>
