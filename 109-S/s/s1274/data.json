Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a comprehensive research and development program to promote communications interoperability among first responders; and (2) make grants to states and eligible regions for initiatives necessary to achieve short-tern or long-term solutions to statewide, regional, national, and where appropriate, international interoperability."
