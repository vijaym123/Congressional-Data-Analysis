    "text": "Small Business, Homeowners, and Renters Disaster Relief Act of 2005 - Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make loans to: (1) small businesses and small agricultural cooperatives that demonstrate a direct adverse economic impact caused by Hurricane Katrina; and (2) nonprofit organizations for purposes of repairing damage caused by Hurricane Katrina or performing other hurricane relief services in a damaged area. Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to authorize the Administrator to guarantee development company debentures issued for the purpose of rebuilding or resuming operations in a Hurricane Katrina-damaged area. Authorizes appropriations to the: (1) Department of Commerce to provide, in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and Florida, bridge grants and loans to small businesses in areas which the President has designated as a disaster area as a result of Hurricane Katrina; and (2) SBA for entrepreneurial development for small businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina. Directs the Administrator to: (1) provide an outreach and technical assistance program for affected small businesses; and (2) make supplemental emergency loans to affected small businesses. Authorizes the making of loans to small businesses and farming operations that have or are likely to suffer substantial economic injury on or after January 1, 2005, as the result of a significant increase in energy costs."
