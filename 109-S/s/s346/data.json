Authorizes State Governors to opt out of such prohibition pending promulgation of regulations if notice is submitted to the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to: (1) perform the functions of the Designated Authority of the United States described in the Agreement with respect to the importation and exportation of municipal solid waste; and (2) implement and enforce the Agreement. Directs the Administrator, when making importation decisions under the Agreement, to obtain the consent of each State and to consider the impact of importation on homeland security, public health, and the environment."
