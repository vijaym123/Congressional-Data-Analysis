    "text": "Native American Housing Enhancement Act of 2005 - Amends the Native American Housing Assistance Act of 1996 to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from restricting access to a Native American affordable housing grant based solely on one of four specified factors. Amends title V (Farm Housing) of the Housing Act of 1949 to state that federally recognized Indian tribes who exercise powers of self-government (or their instrumentalities) shall comply with the Indian Civil Rights Act (title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) when receiving assistance under title V. States that title VI (Federally Assisted Programs) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and title VIII (Fair Housing) of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 shall not apply to tribes: (1) covered by Federal law commonly known as the Indian Civil Rights Act; or (2) tribes acting under affordable housing provisions of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996. Amends the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act to make Indian tribes, tribally designated housing entities, or other agencies primarily serving Indians eligible for Youthbuild grants."
