Prohibits the Secretary from issuing a grazing license on specified allotments in and near the Monument, and requires the Secretary to retire such allotments permanently.Authorizes the Secretary to offer to convey to the Box R Ranch, and to convey if the offer is accepted, certain Bureau of Land Management land in exchange for the Rowlett parcel.Designates approximately 23,000 acres of Monument land as the Soda Mountain Wilderness in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Grandfathers existing grazing leases on such land, but prohibits grazing in the applicable Wilderness portion upon retirement of any such lease."
