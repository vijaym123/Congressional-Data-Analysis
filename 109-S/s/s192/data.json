    "text": "Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should develop a planning process for stabilization and reconstruction activities in conflict-affected areas, which shall provide for contingency planning and integration task forces under the general guidance of the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, joint interagency task forces, and a national center for contingency support; (2) the President should strengthen the Government's strategic communication abilities, including creation of a permanent organizational structure within the National Security Council (NSC); (3) a new approach is needed to access, coordinate, and implement Government intelligence and knowledge; (4) open source material should be better exploited; and (5) language proficiency should be enhanced. Requires the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State to: (1) make stabilization and reconstruction capabilities one of the core competencies of their respective Departments; (2) increase cooperation between their Departments; and (3) allocate funding for strategic communication. Requires the Secretary of Defense to: (1) direct commanders of the combatant commands to develop intelligence plans as part of their planning process; (2) develop a program to identify, locate, and track hostile asymmetric warfare operations; and (3) designate the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency to serve as executive agent of a Department of Defense (DOD) program to exploit open sources of information. Requires the Director of National Intelligence to refocus intelligence reform from reorganization to problem solving, including the establishment of a human resource coordination office to develop a comprehensive human resource strategy to optimize resource allocation against critical problems."
