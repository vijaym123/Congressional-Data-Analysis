  <summary>12/13/2005--Introduced.
Portable Generator Safety Act - Instructs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate regulations requiring that every portable generator sold to the public for purposes other than resale be equipped with an interlock safety device that detects the level of carbon monoxide in the areas surrounding the generator and automatically turns off power to it before the level of carbon monoxide is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death to people. Requries such regulations also to require that every such portable generator: (1) prominently display a permanently affixed warning label regarding the carbon monoxide hazard posed by its incorrect use, including the word "DANGER" printed in a large font; and (2) have affixed to it a large pictogram which clearly states "POISONOUS GAS" and visually depicts the harmful effects of breathing carbon monoxide.</summary>
