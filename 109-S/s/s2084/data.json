Requries such regulations also to require that every such portable generator: (1) prominently display a permanently affixed warning label regarding the carbon monoxide hazard posed by its incorrect use, including the word \"DANGER\" printed in a large font; and (2) have affixed to it a large pictogram which clearly states \"POISONOUS GAS\" and visually depicts the harmful effects of breathing carbon monoxide."
