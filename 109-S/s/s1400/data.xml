(Sec. 104) Authorizes states to provide additional assistance, including loan forgiveness, to disadvantaged communities (defined as treatment works service areas or portions thereof that meet state affordability criteria).

(Sec. 202) Redefines "disadvantaged communities" for purposes of state subsidization to include portions of service areas of public water systems. (Sec. 203) Revises requirements for state safe drinking water revolving loan funds to: (1) permit states to reserve up to six percent of funding for administrative costs; (2) eliminate matching requirements; (3) permit states to transfer up to 33% of funding into a clean water revolving fund. (Sec. 204) Allows the use of state safe drinking water revolving loan funds for implementation of source water protection plans. Establishes a priority system for the use of such funds.
