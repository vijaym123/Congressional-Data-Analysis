  <summary>4/5/2005--Introduced.
Rural Schools Geography Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide that a local educational agency shall not be required, under certain requirements added by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, to give a student the option to transfer to another school if such option is impractical owing to the distance to be traveled, a geographical barrier or hazard, the duration of the travel, or an unusually high cost of travel.</summary>
