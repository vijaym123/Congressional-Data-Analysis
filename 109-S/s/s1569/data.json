Defines a QSLTCIP as a state plan amendment that provides for the disregard of any assets or resources in an amount equal to the insurance benefits payments made under a long-term care insurance policy (including a certificate issued under a group insurance contract), but only if the policy meets certain requirements, including coverage of an insured who, at the time coverage first becomes effective, is a resident of such state or of a state that maintains a QSLTCIP. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for educating consumers regarding QSLTCIPs and long-term care insurance policies issued in connection with them."
