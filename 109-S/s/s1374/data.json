Requires recipients to use grant funds to: (1) facilitate coordination with federal, state, and local governments of the tribe's response to a security threat to an international border of the United States; (2) enhance the tribe's capability as a first responder to an illegal crossing by an immigrant over such a border; (3) provide training and technical assistance in the use of effective surveillance technologies and integrated communication systems and equipment; and (4) provide technical advice and assistance to plan and implement strategies to detect and prevent any illegal entry into tribal land, and the transportation of any illegal substance within or near its boundaries."
