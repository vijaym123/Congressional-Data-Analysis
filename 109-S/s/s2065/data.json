Exempts from civil penalties for two years (with a possible two-year renewal) employers who receive certificates of compliance from qualified consultants. Authorizes employers to establish alcohol and substance abuse testing programs in accordance with federal guidelines. Directs the Secretary to provide for: (1) employer cooperative agreements for comprehensive safety and health management systems; (2) an employer voluntary program, with increased small business participation, for excellence in technical and managerial protection of employees from occupational hazards; (3) state cooperative agreements for state consultation services for employers; and (4) a three-state pilot program for expedited consultation services for small businesses. Requires federal personnel responsible for enforcing OSHA to: (1) meet specified eligibility requirements; and (2) if they carry out inspections or investigations, receive professional education and training at least every five years. Authorizes the Secretary to develop and implement at least one training and educational exchange program with a specialty trade in the construction industry for specified activities relating to OSHA Rules."
