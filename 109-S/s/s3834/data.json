    "text": "Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2006 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to impose registration and reporting requirements on pharmacies that seek to deliver, distribute, or dispense over the Internet a controlled substance or prescription drug (online pharmacies). Exempts pharmacies that merely advertise on the Internet. Prohibits the delivery, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance or prescription drug over the Internet without a valid prescription issued pursuant to a medical evaluation conducted in the presence of a registered medical practitioner. Requires an online pharmacy to include on its website: (1) a statement that it complies with the requirements of this Act; (2) identifying information, including its physical address, phone numbers, and email address; (3) the qualifications of its pharmacist-in-charge and the practitioners who prescribe controlled substances or prescription drugs; and (4) a list of states in which it is licensed. Increases criminal penalties for certain controlled substances offenses. Imposes criminal penalties for the unlawful delivery, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances or prescription drugs over the Internet. Authorizes a state attorney general to apply for injunctions or obtain damages and other civil remedies against an online pharmacy that poses a threat to the residents of such state."
