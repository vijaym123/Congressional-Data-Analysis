  <summary>3/7/2006--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individual taxpayers a tax deduction from gross income (available to itemizing and non-itemizing taxpayers) for the cost of health care insurance, including long-term care insurance, for such taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, and dependents. Disallows such tax deduction for taxpayers participating in an employer-paid health care plan or for taxpayers who have health care coverage under certain federal assistance programs.</summary>
