  <summary>7/26/2005--Passed Senate without amendment.
Amends the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 with respect to grants to tribally controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institutions that are not receiving federal support under the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act of 1978 or the Navajo Community College Act to provide basic support for the education and training of Indian students. Revises the definition of "Indian student count" (essential to the formula for the determination of grant amounts). Requires the Indian student count to be determined according to a specified formula, for each academic year, on the basis of the enrollments of Indian students as in effect at the conclusion of the third week of the fall term and the third week of the spring term. Allows the counting of students without secondary school degrees under certain circumstances.</summary>
