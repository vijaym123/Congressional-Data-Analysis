Requires the council to include members from minority serving institutions. Requires: (1) a matching recipient contribution of 25 percent of the federal assistance amount; and (2) annual reports from recipients to the NSF Director on the uses of such assistance. Makes the following institutions eligible for such assistance: (1) a historically Black college or university; (2) a Hispanic-, Alaska Native-, or Native Hawaiian-serving institution; (3) a tribally controlled college or university; or (4) an institution determined to have enrolled a substantial number of minority, low-income students who received assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965.
