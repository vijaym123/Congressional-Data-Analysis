Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) review any such proposed change to determine any potential security concerns; and (2) transmit such review to the marine terminal operator and to the President for purposes of a certain mandatory investigation to determine the effects on national security of such mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers which could result in the ownership of a marine terminal operator within a U.S. port being controlled by a foreign entity."
