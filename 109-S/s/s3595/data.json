    "text": "United States Emergency Management Authority Act of 2006 - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to replace provisions concerning the Directorate of, and the Under Secretary for, Emergency Preparedness and Response in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with provisions establishing a United States Emergency Management Authority to lead the nation's efforts to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the risks of natural and man-made disasters, including catastrophic incidents. Directs the Authority's Administrator to: (1) provide federal leadership necessary to prepare for and respond to disasters; (2) develop a National Emergency Management System capable of responding to catastrophic incidents; (3) establish 10 Regional Offices; and (4) promote public and community preparedness. Transfers functions of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Directorate to the Authority. Requires the Authority to be maintained as a distinct entity within DHS. Establishes within the Authority a Director for Preparedness and a Director for Response and Recovery. Requires: (1) each Regional Administrator to establish multi-agency strike teams; and (2) the Secretary of DHS to establish the National Advisory Council on Emergency Preparedness and Response. Establishes within the Authority a National Incident Management System Integration Center, a Chief Medical Officer, a National Search and Rescue Response System, and a Metropolitan Medical Response System. Establishes within DHS a National Operations Center, a System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders Program, an Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Telecommunications, and an Office for the Prevention of Terrorism. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to make grants to administer and improve the Emergency Management Assistance Compact."
