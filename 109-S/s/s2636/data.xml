Oil Company Accountability Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) grant individual taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of not more than $120,000 a $500 tax rebate in 2006; (2) require large integrated oil companies to make certain adjustments to the value of their LIFO inventories of crude oil, natural gas, or other petroleum products; and (3) deny a foreign tax credit to large integrated oil companies designated as dual capacity taxpayers for amounts paid to a foreign country which does not have a generally applicable income tax and from which such oil companies receive an economic benefit. Defines "large integrated oil companies" as companies with annual gross receipts in excess of $1 billion and average daily worldwide crude oil production of at least 500,000 barrels.</summary>
