  <summary>9/12/2005--Introduced.
National Constitution Center Operations Act - Amends the Constitution Heritage Act of 1988 to set forth requirements for cooperative agreements between the Secretary of the Interior and the National Constitution Center (NCC) for the operation of the NCC, including a requirement that revenues from the operation of the NCC be made available to the NCC (without further appropriation) to offset its operating expenses, and requirements that the NCC: (1) maintain appropriate risk insurance; (2) maintain its tax-exempt status; and (3) report annually to the Secretary or Congress on its activities, goals and plans. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate a cooperative agreement in the public interest. Exempts agreements, leases, contracts or other arrangements entered into under this Act from certain requirements for leases of buildings by the federal government and for the award of concession contracts in units of the National Park System.</summary>
