    "text": "Border Operations Reform and Development of Electronic Remote Surveillance Act of 2006 or the BORDERS Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) utilize aerial surveillance technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles, to enhance U.S. international border security; (2) procure additional unmanned aerial vehicles and other technologies necessary to achieve border control, and to establish a border security perimeter known as a \"virtual fence\" to provide a barrier to illegal immigration (Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program); and (3) implement a plan to ensure clear and secure 2-way communication capabilities, including the specific use of satellite communications, among Border Patrol agents conducting operations between ports of entry, between Border Patrol agents and their respective Border Patrol stations, and between all appropriate border security agencies of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act of 2004 to increase detention bed space. Directs the Secretary to: (1) construct or acquire additional detention facilities, including the use of federal facilities as alternative detention facilities; and (2) codify detention standards. Prohibits an alien's detention in a location that limits reasonable access to legal assistance. Provides for DHS increases in: (1) Customs and Border Protection personnel; (2) Border Patrol agents; (3) Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators; (4) detention and removal personnel; (5) legal personnel; and (6) investigative personnel. Provides for Department of Justice increases in: (1) litigation, defense, and U.S. attorneys; (2) U.S. marshals; and (3) immigration judges. Authorizes appropriations for the state criminal alien assistance program. Provides reimbursement for costs related to the incarceration of illegal aliens for: (1) state preconviction costs; and (2) indirect related costs for border states or states with large numbers of undocumented aliens. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make criminal street gang activity a grounds for inadmissibility."
