    "text": "Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to reduce, through December 31, 2009, the duty on certain cotton shirting fabrics. Limits the quantity of imported woven fabrics of cotton containing 85% or more by weight of cotton entered by or on behalf of each manufacturer of men's and boy's shirts. Provides for the issuance of import licenses subject to such limitation. Establishes the Pima Cotton Trust Fund within the Treasury, consisting of transfers from the general fund in amounts attributable to the duty received since January 1, 1994, on woven fabrics of cotten under specified headings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. Provides for annual distribution of amounts from such Fund to a nationally recognized association of shirting manufacturers for the promotion of U.S.-grown pima cotton, and to yarn spinners of such cotton."
