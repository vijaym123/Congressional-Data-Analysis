  <summary>6/13/2005--Introduced.
Federal Contractor Extraterritorial Jurisdiction for Human Trafficking Offenses Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to require a federal contractor who engages, outside the United States, in conduct that would constitute a peonage, slavery, or human trafficking offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year if it occurred in U.S. jurisdiction to be punished as provided for that offense. Prohibits the commencement of a prosecution against any such contractor if a foreign government has prosecuted or is prosecuting such person for the offense, except upon specified approval. Permits an individual who is a victim of such a violation by a federal contractor to bring a civil action if a civil action would have been authorized had the conduct been engaged in within U.S. jurisdiction.</summary>
