Requires the Secretary of Education to: (1) determine an immediate need for such assistance before requesting such a funds transfer; and (2) obligate certain funds for an additional year as emergency funding to meet the students' educational needs. Shortens the period for certain advance notifications to Congress under the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2005, in particular the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2005."
