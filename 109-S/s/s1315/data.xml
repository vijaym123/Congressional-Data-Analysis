International Cooperation to Meet the Millennium Development Goals Act of 2005 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should continue to provide the leadership shown at the July 2005 summit of the Group of Eight to encourage other countries to pursue the Millennium Development Goals; (2) the President should urge the Group of Eight to consider the findings and recommendations contained in the report prepared by the Commission for Africa entitled "Our Common Interest"; (3) the Group of Eight, as well as governments of the countries of Africa and regional organizations of such governments, should honor the commitments made in the Group's Africa Action Plan; and (4) the international community should continue to build upon the progress made at the July 2005 summit and the September 2005 U.N. summit toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and should further enable such progress at the Sixth Ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization scheduled for December 2005. Directs the Secretary of State to report to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on International Relations respecting the international community's progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Requires the report to include: (1) a review of commitments made by the United States and other members of the international community concerning the ability of the developing world to achieve the Millennium Development Goals; (2) a review of U.S. policies and progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, as well as policies to provide continued leadership in achieving such goals by 2015; (3) an evaluation of the contributions of other national and international actors in achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015; and (4) an assessment of the likelihood that the Millennium Development Goals will be achieved.</summary>
