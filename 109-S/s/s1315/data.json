Directs the Secretary of State to report to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on International Relations respecting the international community's progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Requires the report to include: (1) a review of commitments made by the United States and other members of the international community concerning the ability of the developing world to achieve the Millennium Development Goals; (2) a review of U.S. policies and progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, as well as policies to provide continued leadership in achieving such goals by 2015; (3) an evaluation of the contributions of other national and international actors in achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015; and (4) an assessment of the likelihood that the Millennium Development Goals will be achieved."
