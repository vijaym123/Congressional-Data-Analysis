Requires the Secretary to establish the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee to: (1) coordinate all efforts within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) concerning autism spectrum disorder; (2) develop and update advances in research; (3) monitor and make recommendations to the Secretary regarding federal activities related to such disorder; (4) make recommendations to the Secretary regarding public participation in decisions relating to such disorder; (5) develop and annually update a strategic plan for autism spectrum disorder research; and (6) submit to Congress such strategic plan and related updates.
