Sheltering All Veterans Everywhere Act or SAVE Reauthorization Act of 2005 - Extends through FY2011: (1) the authorization of appropriations for Department of Veterans Affairs comprehensive services for homeless veterans; (2) the homeless veterans reintegration program; (3) a Department program to provide additional services to homeless veterans at certain locations; (4) a Department grant program for homeless veterans with special needs; (5) the authorization of appropriations for the homeless veteran service provider technical assistance program; and (6) the Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans. Makes the rate for per diem payments under the Department's comprehensive services for homeless veterans programs the same as that authorized for State homes for veterans' domiciliary care. Includes veterans at imminent risk of homelessness under the veterans reintegration program. Makes permanent (currently terminates at the end of 2008) the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to transfer properties obtained through foreclosures of Department home mortgages to certain organizations to assist homeless veterans and their families in acquiring shelter. Requires: (1) additional information in an annual report from the Secretary to the congressional veterans' committees on assistance provided to homeless veterans; and (2) a new report from the Secretary to the defense and veterans' committees on the intersection of military sexual trauma and homelessness in veterans.</summary>
