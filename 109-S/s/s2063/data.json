Entitles students receiving such leave, upon release from active duty, to be restored to prior educational status attained without loss of academic credits earned, scholarships or grants awarded, or tuition or fees paid, unless those have been refunded. Requires institutions to give such students certain refunds of tuition or fees paid prior to active duty, or to credit such amounts to the next enrollment period after the student returns, at the student's option."
