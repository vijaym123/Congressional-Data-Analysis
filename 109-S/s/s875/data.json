Permits automatically-enrolled employees to opt out of plan participation. Requires such plans to provide for annual increases in employee contributions up to a maximum level of ten percent of employee compensation. Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to: (1) preempt State laws that would prohibit or restrict automatic employee contributions; and (2) direct the Secretary of Labor to provide guidance, by regulations, to employers in selecting default investments for employees who elect not to direct the investment of their pension plan assets."
