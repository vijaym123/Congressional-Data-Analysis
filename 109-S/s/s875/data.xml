  <summary>4/21/2005--Introduced.
Save More for Retirement Act of 2005 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a 401(k) pension plan which provides for automatic enrollment of new employees shall be treated as meeting nondiscrimination requirements if employers contribute a specified amount to such plans, allow for earlier vesting of employee ownership, and provide certain notices to employees of their rights and obligations under such plans. Permits automatically-enrolled employees to opt out of plan participation. Requires such plans to provide for annual increases in employee contributions up to a maximum level of ten percent of employee compensation. Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to: (1) preempt State laws that would prohibit or restrict automatic employee contributions; and (2) direct the Secretary of Labor to provide guidance, by regulations, to employers in selecting default investments for employees who elect not to direct the investment of their pension plan assets.</summary>
