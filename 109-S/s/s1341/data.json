Requires preseparation counseling on: (1) certification and licensure requirements for civilian occupations; and (2) civilian occupations that correspond to military occupational specialties.

Extends preseparation counseling to members of the National Guard being separated from long-term duty. Directs the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to require participation in the Department of Labor transitional services program unless members previously participated in the program or are returning to previously held employment or educational pursuits.
