(Sec. 805) Amends INA to extend aging out protection to children who are victims of domestic abuse by a permanent resident parent who have petitioned for permanent resident status prior to becoming 21 years old. Applies specified age-related immigrant allocation children and immediate relative rules to self-petitioners and derivatives of self-petitioners. Permits an immigrant son or daughter who qualified to file a petition for immigrant status before reaching 21 years of age but did not do so to petition for such status before reaching 25 years of age if the person can show a connection between such delay and having been battered. Eliminates from the definition of \"child\" the two-year custody and residency requirement for adopted children who have been battered or subject to extreme cruelty. Subtitle B: VAWA Self-Petitioners - (Sec. 811) Amends INA to define \"VAWA self-petitioner\" as an alien, or a child of an alien, who qualifies for relief under specified provisions of INA, the Cuban Adjustment Act, the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, or the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. (Sec. 812) Authorizes an alien who is a VAWA self-petitioner or eligible for certain relief as a battered spouse to remain in the United States as a fiance/fiancee (K-visa) nonimmigrant alien despite not marrying within the required three-month period if such marriage takes place at a later date. Exempts a K-visa alien who did not marry within such three-month period from the conditional residency requirement if: (1) the alien married the U.S. citizen petitioner; (2) such petitioner subjected a VAWA self-petitioner to battery or extreme cruelty; and (3) the alien shows a substantial connection between the battery or extreme cruelty and the failure to marry within the three-month period. (Sec. 813) Makes restrictions for relief under cancellation of removal and under adjustment of status to permanent resident provisions for failure to depart voluntarily from the United States inapplicable to aliens who filed petitions as VAWA self-petitioners or as battered (or subjected to extreme cruelty) spouses or children if such battering or extreme cruelty is substantially connected to the alien's overstaying of the grant of voluntary departure. Requires that a voluntary departure order include the penalties for noncompliance. (Sec. 814) Amends removal provisions to include within the definition of \"exceptional circumstances\" battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien. States that the Secretary, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of State shall continue to have discretion to consent to an alien's reapplication for admission after a previous order of removal, deportation, or exclusion. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretaries and the Attorney General should particularly consider exercising such authority in VAWA cases involving T- or U-visa nonimmigrants, and cases involving cancellation of removal and status adjustment for battered spouses and children. States that waiver of deportation authority for victims of domestic violence, stalking, or extreme violence may be applied in cancellation of removal proceedings. (Sec. 815) Amends VAWA to extend VAWA deportation protections to aliens eligible for relief under the Cuban Adjustment Act and the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998. Amends INA to authorize employment for VAWA self-petitioners.

(Sec. 817) Amends INA to permit self-petitions for permanent resident status by an alien who: (1) is the parent of a U.S. citizen or was a parent of a U.S. citizen who, within the past two years, lost or renounced citizenship status related to an incident of domestic violence or died; (2) is of good moral character; (3) is eligible for immediate relative classification; (4) resides, or has resided, with the citizen daughter or son; and (5) was battered or subject to extreme cruelty by the citizen daughter or son. (Sec. 818) Amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to prohibit the the Department of Justice, DHS, or the Department of State from making an adverse determination of admissibility or deportability based solely on information furnished by a trafficker or perpetrator of a crime with respect to an alien applying for T-visa status, a VAWA self-petitioner, or a battered alien. Subtitle C: Miscellaneous Amendments - (Sec. 821) Amends INA to make T- and U-visas available for four years with an extension if a federal, state, or local law enforcement official, prosecutor, or judge investigating or prosecuting human trafficking or criminal activity certifies that the alien's presence is necessary to assist in such activity's investigation or prosecution. Authorizes a nonimmigrant classification change to T- or U-visa classification. Replaces references to the Attorney General with references to the Secretary. (Sec. 822) Makes specified amendments to physical presence and moral character provisions. (Sec. 823) Amends the Cuban Adjustment Act to extend for two years (after the death of the Cuban alien or termination of the marriage) the period for a battered alien spouse of such alien to petition for permanent resident status if there is demonstrated a connection between the marriage termination and the battering or extreme cruelty by the Cuban alien. (Sec. 824) Amends the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998 to permit the alien spouse or child of a Haitian alien who is or was eligible for permanent resident status (currently, who was so adjusted) to self-petition for permanent resident status.

States that filing such motion shall stay an alien's removal under either of such proceedings pending final disposition of the motion, including appeals. (Sec. 826) States that a \"special immigrant\" juvenile who has been battered, abused, neglected, or abandoned shall not be compelled to contact the alleged abuser (or family member of the alleged abuser) at any stage of applying for such status. (Sec. 827) Amends the Real ID Act of 2005 to permit a state driver's license or identity card to use an alternative address for a qualifying person who has been subjected to battery, extreme cruelty, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. (Sec. 828) Directs the Attorney General, the Secretary, and the Secretary of State to promulgate implementing regulations for this Act and the Battered Immigrant Women Protection Act of 2000.
