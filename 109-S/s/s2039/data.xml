Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2005 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to direct the Attorney General to establish a loan repayment program for student loan borrowers who agree in writing to remain employed as state or local criminal prosecutors or federal, state, or local public defenders for not less than three years. Requires borrowers who are involuntarily separated from employment due to misconduct or who voluntarily leave employment before the required three-year period to repay any benefits received under this Act. Limits the amount of loans which may be repaid to $10,000 for any borrower in any calendar year, or an aggregate total of $60,000 for any borrower. Authorizes the Attorney General to enter into an additional loan repayment agreement with a borrower to remain employed as a prosecutor or public defender for a period of less than three years. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
