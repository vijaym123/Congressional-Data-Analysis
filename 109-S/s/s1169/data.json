Requires that such report be made available to the public. Defines \"data-mining\" as a query, search, or other analysis of one or more electronic databases, where: (1) at least one of the databases was obtained from or remains under the control of a non-federal entity, or the information was acquired initially by another federal department or agency for purposes other than intelligence or law enforcement; (2) a federal department or agency or a non-federal entity acting on behalf of the federal government is conducting the query, search, or other analysis to find a predictive pattern indicating terrorist or criminal activity; and (3) the search does not use a specific individual's personal identifiers to acquire information concerning that individual. Mandates annual updates, including any new uses or development of data-mining technology."
