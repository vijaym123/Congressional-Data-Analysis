Theodore Roosevelt Commemorative Coin Act - (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue $1 silver coins: (1) emblematic of the life and legacy of President Theodore Roosevelt, bearing his image as a Rough Rider on one side and an eagle design on the other side; and (2) bearing his image on horseback on one side and depicting a flaming sword of righteousness on the other side. Expresses the sense of Congress that the coins should be struck at the U.S. Mint at West Point, New York. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) issue such coins beginning on January 1, 2006; and (2) initiate coin sales before such date. (2006 will mark the 100th anniversary of Roosevelt's award of the Nobel Peace Prize.) (Sec. 7) Requires payment of $10 surcharges from the coin sales to: (1) the Theodore Roosevelt Association, to be used exclusively for educational programs at Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, including a visitor's center; and (2) the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation, to be used exclusively for educational programs at and around the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, including construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Badlands Institute in the badlands of North Dakota. Requires that: (1) 70 % of surcharges received be paid to the Theodore Roosevelt Association; and (2) 30 % of surcharges received be paid to the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation. (Sec. 8) Authorizes the Secretary to continue to issue, after December 31, 2005, numismatic items that contain 5-cent coins minted in the years 2004 and 2005. (Sec. 9) Amends the Lewis and Clark Expedition Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act to instruct the Secretary to distribute one-half of surcharge proceeds to the National Council of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial, and one-half to the Missouri Historical Society. Requires that funds that remain unexpended by the National Council of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial or the Missouri Historical Society as of June 30, 2007, be transferred to the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation to establish a trust for the stewardship of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</summary>
