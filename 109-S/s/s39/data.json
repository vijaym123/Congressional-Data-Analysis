(Sec. 103) Directs the Administrator of NOAA, in carrying out the program, to: (1) conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages or other scientific activities to survey, inventory, observe, and assess little-known areas of the marine environment; (2) promote the development of oceanographic research; (3) accept donations for purposes of exploring or increasing knowledge of the oceans; and (4) avoid directing the programs towards activities relating to global warming, and instead focus on underwater regions of particular interest. (Sec. 104) Requires the NOAA to convene an ocean technology and infrastructure task force to develop and implement a strategy to: (1) facilitate the transfer of new exploration technology to the program; (2) improve the availability of communications infrastructure (including satellite capabilities) to the program; (3) develop a data management information processing system for information obtained under the program; (4) conduct public outreach activities to improve public understanding of ocean science, resources, and processes; and (5) encourage cost-sharing partnerships to assist in transferring exploration technology and technical expertise to the program. (Sec. 105) Authorizes the NOAA, the National Science Foundation, and other federal agencies participating in the program to participate in interagency financing in carrying out program activities. (Sec. 107) Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2015. Title II: Undersea Research Program - NOAA Undersea Research Program Act of 2005 - (Sec. 202) Directs the Administrator of NOAA to establish and maintain an undersea research program. (Sec. 203) Requires the program to: (1) be conducted through a national headquarters, a network of regional undersea research centers, and a national technology institute; and (2) increase scientific knowledge for the informed management, use, and preservation of oceanic, coastal, and large lake resources through undersea research, exploration, education, and technology development. (Sec. 207) Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2015."
