  <summary>9/21/2005--Introduced.
Establishes in the legislative branch a bipartisan Katrina Commission to report to the President and Congress on : (1) the federal, state, and local response to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Region of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and other affected areas; (2) the circumstances surrounding the Hurricane's approach, and the extent of federal, state, and local government preparedness for and response to it; (3) planning necessary for future cataclysmic events that will require a significant marshaling of federal resources, mitigation, response, and recovery to avoid significant loss of life; (4) whether any decisions differed with respect to response and recovery for different communities, and what problems occurred as a result of a lack of a common plan, communication structure, and centralized command structure; and (5) immediate corrective measures that can be taken to prevent problems with federal response to future cataclysmic events.</summary>
