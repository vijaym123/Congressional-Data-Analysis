    "text": "Animal Feed Protection Act of 2005 - Makes it unlawful for any person to introduce into interstate or foreign commerce a covered article that contains: (1) specified risk material from a ruminant, or any material from a ruminant that was in any foreign country when there was a risk of transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and may contain specified risk material from a ruminant; or (2) any material from a ruminant exhibiting signs of a neurological disease. States that the head of a Federal agency may: (1) seize and destroy an article that is introduced into interstate or foreign commerce in violation of this Act; or (2) require any person who is in violation of this Act to cease the violation, to recall any sold article and refund the purchase price, to destroy or forfeit the article to the United States for destruction, or to cease production operations until the head of the appropriate Federal agency determines that there is no longer a violation of this Act. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for related civil and monetary penalties. Defines \"covered article\" as: (1) animal feed, nutritional supplement, or medicine; and (2) any other article that is ordinarily ingested, implanted, or otherwise taken into an animal. Sets forth exceptions. Defines \"specified risk material\" as: (1) the skull, brain, trigeminal ganglia, eyes, tonsils, spinal cord, vertebral column, or dorsal root ganglia of cattle and bison 30 months of age and older, or sheep, goats, deer, and elk 12 months of age and older; (2) the intestinal tract of any ruminant; and (3) any other material of a ruminant that may carry a prion disease."
