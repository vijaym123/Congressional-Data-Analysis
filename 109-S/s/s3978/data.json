    "text": "Debit and Check Card Consumer Protection Act of 2006 - Amends the Electronic Funds Transfer Act regarding consumer liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers to repeal the provision that financial institutions need not reimburse a consumer for losses that would not have occurred but for the consumer's failure to report an unauthorized electronic fund transfer or account error within a certain time period. Repeals the $500 consumer liability limit for such unauthorized transfers or account errors (thus applying the regular $50 maximum limit currently specified for timely reported unauthorized transfers or account errors). Applies error resolution requirements to any charge for goods or services not accepted by the consumer (or designee), or not delivered to the consumer (or designee), in accordance with the agreement made at the time of a transaction. Sets forth the rights of consumers with respect to issuers of accepted credit and debit cards."
