  <summary>12/22/2006--Public Law.
Creating Opportunities for Minor League Professionals, Entertainers, and Teams through Legal Entry Act of 2006 or the COMPETE Act of 2006 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to enlarge the scope of P-1 (athletes and entertainers) nonimmigrant visas to include: (1) a professional athlete; (2) a person who performs as an athlete, coach, or part of a team that is located in the United States and is a member of certain amateur foreign leagues or associations from which a significant number of individuals are drafted by major sports leagues or their minor league affiliates; and (3) a professional or amateur athlete who performs individually or as part of a group in a theatrical ice skating production coming to the United States in a specific ice skating production or tour. (Currently such provision is limited to athletes performing at an "internationally recognized level of performance.") Prohibits visa issuance to an alien from a country that is a state sponsor of international terrorism unless the Secretary of State determines that such alien is not a threat to U.S. security. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to permit: (1) a petition to seek P-1 classification for multiple alien athletes; and (2) athletes or their employers to seek admission for such athletes under other than P-1 provisions of INA if eligible under such other provisions.</summary>
