    "text": "United States-Russia Polar Bear Conservation and Management Act of 2005 - Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to make it unlawful for a person to take, import, export, possess, transport, or sell any polar bear or polar bear products in violation of the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population (Agreement) or any annual taking limit or other restriction adopted by the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Commission. Authorizes a government official to import a polar bear or a polar bear product for purposes of forensic testing or any other law enforcement purpose. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to administer and enforce the Agreement on behalf of the United States. Sets forth provisions: (1) requiring the seizure and forfeiture of polar bear and polar bear products that are, or are attempted to be, imported, exported, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of this Act; and (2) authorizing the detention and inspection of containers (including accompanying documents) for polar bear and polar bear products. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Considers violations under this Act to be transportation of wildlife for purposes of the prohibition on the import, export, or sale of fish, plants, and wildlife in violation of U.S., Indian, state, or foreign laws under the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981. Sets forth requirements for designation and appointment of U.S. members on the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Commission. Requires the Secretary to take all appropriate actions to implement the decisions and determinations of the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Commission. Authorizes the Secretary to share authority for the management of the taking of polar bears for subsistence purposes with the Alaska Nanuuq Commission. Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2010 for the Secretary: (1) to carry out functions and responsibilities under this Act and the Agreement; (2) to carry out functions and responsibilities of the U.S. Section to the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Commission; and (3) to carry out the Alaskan Cooperative Management Program."
