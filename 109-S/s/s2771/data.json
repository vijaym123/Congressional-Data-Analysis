    "text": "Disaster Housing Flexibility Act of 2006 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to direct the President, in making any determination of housing disaster assistance cost effectiveness, to: (1) consider if manufactured modular housing can be provided at a cost to the government less than that of other readily fabricated dwellings; and (2) seek recipient consent before providing assistance for such housing. Declares that any individual or household rejecting manufactured modular housing assistance shall remain eligible for any other available disaster or emergency housing assistance. Permits federal financial assistance for semi-permanent housing construction in any major disaster or emergency area declared in connection with Hurricane Katrina of 2005. Permits permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary housing located in any area having special flood hazards under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. Prescribes guidelines for individual sites for manufactured modular housing. Instructs the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop and maintain detailed and comprehensive mass evacuation plans for assistance recipients."
