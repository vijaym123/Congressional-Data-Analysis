  <summary>11/9/2005--Introduced.
Abortion Non-Discrimination Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to include a health care entity's refusal to provide coverage of, or pay for, induced abortions among the bases for which the federal government or any state or local government that receives federal financial assistance may not discriminate against such an entity. Expands the definition of "health care entity" to include a hospital, a provider sponsored organization, a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, and any other kind of health care facility, organization, or plan.</summary>
