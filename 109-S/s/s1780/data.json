Revises various disclosure and oversight requirements relating to tax-exempt organizations. Restores and increases funding for the Social Services Block Grant Program. Savings for Working Families Act of 2005 - Allows certain low income individuals to establish individual development accounts (IDAs) to accumulate assets for homeownership, education, business startup, and other purposes. Allows an investment tax credit for contributions to an IDA. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to award grants to, and enter into cooperative agreements with, nongovernmental organizations to assist nonprofit community-based organizations in delivering social services. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract for an evaluation of maternity group homes under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act."
