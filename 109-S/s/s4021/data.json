Makes Medicare the secondary payor for 9/11-related coverage. Prohibits a workers' compensation law or plan from discriminating against an individual by virtue of the individual's entitlement to such benefits. Prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual regarding hiring, advancement, compensation, or other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment by virtue of the individual's entitlement to such benefits. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a consortium to conduct and coordinate screening, monitoring, treatment, and diagnostic research on the 9/11 disaster-connected health conditions."
