Prohibits the Secretary from using any amounts associated with an agreement entered under the Act for the purposes of land acquisition, regulatory activity, or the development, maintenance, or operation of infrastructure, with the exception of ancillary support facilities that the Secretary determines to be necessary for the completion of projects or activities identified in the agreement.
