Boy Scouts of America Land Transfer Act of 2006 - Authorizes the Utah National Parks Council of the Boy Scouts of America (the Boy Scouts) to convey to Brian Head Resort certain public land in Utah acquired under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act (the Act) for the purpose of operating a camp in exchange for conveyance by Brian Head Resort of certain of its private land to the Boy Scouts. Requires that, upon conveyance to the Boy Scouts, the private land shall be subject to the terms and conditions imposed on the entire tract of land acquired by the Boy Scouts for a camp under a specified Bureau of Land Management (BLM) patent. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, upon completion of the land exchanges under this Act, to amend the original BLM patent providing for the conveyance of the public land to the Boy Scouts under the Act to take into account such exchanges.</summary>
