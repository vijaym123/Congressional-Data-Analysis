Authorizes the issuance of tax-exempt facility bonds for nuclear power facilities. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the tax credit for electricity produced from certain renewable resources should be extended through 2010; and (2) the tax credit for increasing research activities should be increased and made permanent. Terminates the tax credits proposed by this Act after 2010."
