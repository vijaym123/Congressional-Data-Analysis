  <summary>5/23/2005--Introduced.
Reinforce the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Act of 2005 - Reaffirms congressional support for the objectives of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and expresses support for appropriate measures to strengthen the NPT. Calls on all parties participating in the Seventh Review Conference on the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons to make good faith efforts to: (1) comply with NPT nonproliferation obligations; (2) establish more effective controls on sensitive technologies that can be used to produce nuclear weapons material; (3) expand the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) inspection and monitoring ability; (4) demonstrate the international community's opposition to the Iranian nuclear weapons program; (5) support U.S. diplomatic efforts in the context of the six-party talks to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons programs; (6) pursue diplomacy to address regional security problems in Northeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East, which would facilitate nonproliferation and disarmament efforts in those regions; (7) accelerate programs to safeguard and eliminate nuclear weapons-usable material; (8) halt the use of highly enriched uranium in civilian reactors; (9) strengthen national and international export controls and relevant security measures; (10) agree that no state may withdraw from the NPT and escape responsibility for prior Treaty violations or retain access to controlled materials and equipment acquired for "peaceful" purposes; (11) accelerate efforts to reduce stockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons-grade fissile material; and (12) strengthen Proliferation Security Initiative support.</summary>
