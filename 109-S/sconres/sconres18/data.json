    "text": "Sets forth the congressional budget for the Federal Government for FY 2006, including the appropriate budgetary levels for FY 2005 through 2010. Title I: Levels and Amounts - (Sec. 101) Lists recommended budgetary levels and amounts, for FY 2005 through 2010, with respect to: (1) Federal revenues; (2) new budget authority; (3) budget outlays; (4) deficits; (5) debt subject to limit; and (6) debt held by the public. (Sec. 102) Lists the appropriate levels of new budget authority, outlays, and administrative expenses for Social Security and specified major functional categories for FY 2005 through 2010. Title II: Reconciliation - (Sec. 201) Requires, by June 6, 2005, recommendations to the Senate Committee on the Budget of changes in law within their respective jurisdictions sufficient to reduce outlays by specified amounts by the following Committees: (1) Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; (2) Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; (3) Commerce, Science, and Transportation; (4) Energy and Natural Resources; (5) Environment and Public Works; and (6) Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Requires the Senate Committee on the Budget to report to the Senate a reconciliation bill carrying out all such recommendations without any substantive revision. Directs the Senate Committee on Finance to report a reconciliation bill by: (1) September 7, 2005, that consists of changes in laws within its jurisdiction sufficient to reduce the total level of revenues by no more than $19.016 billion for FY 2006 and $128.580 billion for the period FY 2006 through 2010; and (2) September 16, 2005, that consists solely of changes in laws within its jurisdiction to increase the statutory debt limit by $446.464 billion.

(Sec. 301) Allows the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget (Chairman) to revise allocations of new budget authority and outlays, revenue aggregates, and other appropriate aggregates (allocations and aggregates), provided that it would not increase the deficit for FY 2006 through FY 2010, if the Senate Finance Committee or the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions reports legislation providing incentives or other support for adoption of modern information technology to improve quality in health care, and providing for performance-based payments based on accepted clinical performance measures that improve the quality in health care. (Sec. 302) Allows the Chairman to make the appropriate adjustments in committee allocations and aggregates, provided that it would not increase the deficit for FY 2006 through 2056, if the Senate Committee on the Judiciary reports legislation that: (1) compensates injured victims of asbestos-related disease; (2) does not compensate uninjured claimants or those suffering from a disease not shown to be asbestos-related disease; (3) requires strict medical criteria; and (4) is reasonably expected to remain funded from non-Federal sources for the 50-year life of the fund. (Sec. 303) Allows the Chairman to revise allocations and aggregates, provided that it would not increase the deficit for FY 2006 and for the period FY 2006 through FY 2010, if the Senate Finance Committee or the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions reports legislation that addresses health care costs, coverage, or care for the uninsured, provides safety net access to integrated and other health care services, or increases the number of people with health insurance (provided that such increase is not obtained primarily as a result of increasing premiums for the currently insured), and increases access to coverage through mechanisms that decrease the growth of health care costs, and may include tax- and market-based measures. (Sec. 304) Allows the Chairman to revise committee allocations for the Senate Committee on Appropriations and other appropriate budgetary aggregates, if the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reports legislation that permits exploration and production of oil in the 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), and such measure is enacted and the reconciliation instruction set out in this Act is met, by the amount provided in reported legislation that provides funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, Federal Land Acquisition and Stateside Grant Programs, the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program, and the Forest Legacy Program, at least at the previous year's levels, adjusted for inflation, and makes available a portion of the receipts resulting from enactment of such legislation permitting exploration and production of oil in the 1002 Area and for such Fund and Programs. Limits the adjustment to $350 million in new budget authority in each of FY 2008 through 2010. (Sec. 305) Allows the Chairman to revise appropriately committee allocations and aggregates, if the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions reports legislation that eliminates the accumulated shortfall of budget authority resulting from insufficient appropriations of discretionary new budget authority previously enacted for the Federal Pell Grant Program for awards made through the award year 2005-2006. Limits the adjustment to $4.300 billion in new budget authority for FY 2006. (Sec. 306) Allows the Chairman to revise committee allocations and aggregates if the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions reports legislation that reauthorizes the Higher Education Act of 1965. Limits amounts to $748 billion in new budget authority and $684 billion in outlays for FY 2006, and $5.603 billion in new budget authority and $5.099 billion in outlays for FY 2006 through 2010. (Sec. 307) Allows the Chairman to revise committee allocations and aggregates if the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reports legislation that provides for a national energy policy, and in conjunction with revenue legislation that does not reduce net revenues by more than $803 billion in FY 2006 and $4.557 billion for FY 2006 through 2010, Limits amounts to $100 million in new budget authority for FY 2006 and the outlays flowing therefrom and $2 billion in new budget authority for the period FY 2006 through 2010 and the outlays flowing therefrom.

(Sec. 502) Expresses the sense of the Senate that a commission should be established to review Federal agencies and their programs with the express purpose of providing Congress with recommendations and implementing legislation to realign or eliminate Government agencies and programs that are wasteful, duplicative, inefficient, outdated, irrelevant, or have failed to accomplish their intended purpose. (Sec. 503) Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should provide sufficient funding to the Department of Defense (DOD) to offer members of the Reserve Component continuous access to TRICARE for a premium regardless of their activation status. (Sec. 504) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Senate Finance Committee should not report a reconciliation bill that achieves spending reductions that would: (1) undermine the role the Medicaid program plays as a critical component of the Federal health care system; (2) cap Federal Medicaid spending or otherwise shift Medicaid cost burdens to State or local governments and their taxpayers and health providers forcing a reduction in access to essential health services for low-income elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and children and families; or (3) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance coverage Medicaid provides, which would threaten not only the Federal health care safety net but the entire health care system. (Sec. 505) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) this resolution recognizes the funding challenges faced by tribal colleges and universities and assumes that equitable consideration will be provided to them through funding of the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, the Equity in Educational Land Grant Status Act, title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, and the National Science Foundation, DOD, and Housing and Urban Development Tribal College and University Programs; and (2) such equitable consideration reflects Congress intent to continue to work toward statutory Federal funding authorization goals for tribal colleges and universities. (Sec. 506) Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress supports the President's request to \"Concentrate Federal funds for State and local homeland security assistance programs on the highest threats, vulnerabilities, and needs.\" Urges Congress, in dealing with homeland security assistance grants that relate to port security, to: (1) allocate port security grants under a separate, dedicated program intended specifically for port security enhancements, rather than as part of a combined program for many different infrastructure programs that could lead to reduced funding for port security; (2) devise a method to enable the Secretary of Homeland Security to both distribute port security grants to the Nation's port facilities more quickly and efficiently and give ports the financial resources needed to comply with congressional mandates; and (3) allocate sufficient funding for port security to enable port authorities to comply with mandated security improvements taking into consideration national, economic, and strategic defense concerns, ensure the protection of our Nation's maritime transportation, commerce system, and cruise passengers, strive to achieve funds consistent with the needs estimated by the U.S. Coast Guard, and recognize the unique threats for which port authorities must prepare.

(Sec. 508) Expresses the sense of the Senate that funding for Impact Aid (Title VIII of Public Law 107-110) should be sufficient to insure that all federally connected school districts are provided a payment under that Act that will allow them to address the increase in program costs in recent years, as this is critical for school districts addressing the emotional and family needs of children of military families who have a parent or parents engaged in conflict in Iraq or Afghanistan. (Sec. 509) Expresses the sense of the Senate that any reconciled mandatory agriculture savings required under this resolution should be primarily achieved through modifications to the payment limitation provisions of the Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002.

(Sec. 511) Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should reject any Social Security plan that requires deep benefit cuts or a massive increase in debt, and a failure to act would result in massive debt, deep benefit cuts, and tax increases. (Sec. 512) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume that Congress will: (1) appropriate $750 billion for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) for FY 2006; and (2) enact long-term reauthorization of SCAAP to reimburse State and local governments for the financial burdens undocumented criminal aliens place on their local criminal justice systems. (Sec. 513) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the level of funding provided for the Aeronautics Mission Directorate (AMD) within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) should be increased by $1,582,700,000 between FY 2006 and 2010; and (2) the increases provided should be applied to the Vehicle Systems portion of the AMD's budget for use in subsonic and hypersonic aeronautical research.

(Sec. 515) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) it is ill-advised for DOD to pursue a winner-take-all strategy for the acquisition of destroyers under the next generation destroyer (DDX) program; and (2) the amounts identified in this resolution assume that the DOD will not acquire any destroyer under the next generation destroyer program through a winner-take-all strategy. Defines \"winner-take-all strategy,\" with respect to the acquisition of destroyers under the next generation program, to mean the acquisition (including design and construction) of such destroyers through a single shipyard. (Sec. 516) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the tax cuts assumed in this resolution include repeal of the 1993 law that subjects 85 percent of certain Social Security benefits to the income tax, provided that the revenue loss to the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is fully replaced so that seniors' access to health care is not adversely affected. Provides that, if the inclusion of these proposals would otherwise cause the cost of the tax cuts to exceed the level authorized in the resolution, any excess should be fully offset by closing corporate tax loopholes. (Sec. 517) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the funding levels in this resolution assume that all amounts that have been and will be deposited into the Crime Victims Fund, including amounts deposited in FY 2006 and thereafter, shall remain in the Fund for use as authorized under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. (Sec. 518) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the spending level of budget function 750 (Administration of Justice) is assumed to include $227 million for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA); and (2) unless new legislation is enacted, it is assumed that the HIDTA program will remain with the Office of National Drug Control Policy, where Congress last authorized it to reside. (Sec. 519) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President and Congress should: (1) expeditiously consider the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy during the 109th Congress; and (2) enact a comprehensive, coordinated, and integrated national ocean policy that will ensure the long-term economic and ecological health of the U.S. oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.

(Sec. 522) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller General should each examine the economic impact of U.S. publicly-held debt that is held by foreign governments, institutions, and individuals. (Sec. 523) Expresses the sense of the Senate that a relevant portion of amounts in this budget resolution providing for tax relief should be used to provide: (1) the 86 million Americans who do not itemize deductions an opportunity to deduct charitable contributions; (2) incentives for individuals to give tax free contributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes; (3) incentives for an estimated $2 billion in food donations from farmers, restaurants, and corporations to help the needy, an equivalent of 878 million meals for hungry Americans over ten years; (4) at least 300,000 low-income, working Americans the opportunity to build assets through individual development accounts or IDAs, which can be used to purchase a home, expand educational opportunity, or to start a small business; and (5) incentives for corporate charitable contributions. (Sec. 524) Expresses the sense of the Senate that payments to States from the Federal Water Pollution Control State Revolving Fund under title VI of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act should be increased to $1.350 billion for FY 2006 to assist States and local communities in meeting water quality standards and restoring the health and safety of U.S. water. (Sec. 525) Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should approve the full amount of the President's request for SSA administrative costs for FY 2006, including funds for the implementation of the low-income prescription drug subsidy under part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (as added by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003). (Sec. 526) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the overall discretionary levels set in this resolution assume $75 million in new budget authority in FY 2006 and new outlays in FY 2006 and subsequent years, to fund research and ongoing systematic reviews (consistent with efforts currently undertaken by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality designed to improve scientific evidence related to the comparative effectiveness and safety of prescription drugs and other treatments), and to disseminate the findings from such research to health care practitioners, consumers, and health care purchasers; and (2) knowledge gaps identified through such efforts be addressed in accordance with the authorizing legislation and with oversight from the committees of subject matter jurisdiction.
