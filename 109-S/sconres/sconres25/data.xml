  <summary>4/11/2005--Passed Senate without amendment.
Declares that: (1) European governments should reject Airbus' pending application for launch aid for the A350 and any future applications for launch aid; (2) the European Union, acting for itself and on behalf of its Member States, should renew its commitment to the terms agreed to on January 11, 2005; (3) the U.S. Trade Representative should request the formation of a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute resolution panel at the earliest possible opportunity if there is no immediate agreement to eliminate launch aid for the A350 and all future models and no concrete progress toward a comprehensive bilateral agreement covering all government supports in the large aircraft sector; and (4) the President should take any additional action the President considers appropriate to protect the U.S. interests in fair competition in the large commercial aircraft market.</summary>
