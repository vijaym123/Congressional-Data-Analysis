  <summary>6/8/2006--Introduced.
Congratulates the residents of Jerusalem and the people of Israel on the 39th anniversary of the city's reunification, and believes that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected as they have been by Israel during the past 39 years. Calls upon the President and Secretary of State to affirm as U.S. policy that Jerusalem must remain Israel's undivided capital. Urges the President to: (1) discontinue use of the waiver contained in the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995; (2) carry out such Act's provisions immediately; and (3) begin the process of relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Urges U.S. officials, upon request, to record the birthplace of a U.S. citizen born in Jerusalem as Israel (as provided for by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003).</summary>
