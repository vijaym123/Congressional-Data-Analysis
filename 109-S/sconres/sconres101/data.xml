  <summary>11/16/2006--Passed Senate amended.
Calls on the government of Iran to cease repressive activities aimed at the Iranian Baha'i community, and holds the government of Iran responsible for upholding the rights of its nationals, including the Baha'i community. Requests the President to: (1) call for the government of Iran to emancipate the Baha'i community by granting those rights guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international human rights covenants; (2) emphasize that the United States regards the government of Iran's human rights practices, including its treatment of the Baha'i community and other religious minorities, as a significant factor in U.S.-Iran foreign policy; and (3) initiate a consistent dialogue with other governments and the European Union (EU) in order to persuade the government of Iran to rectify its human rights practices.</summary>
